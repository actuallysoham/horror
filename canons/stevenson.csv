"﻿STORY OF THE DOOR

Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was
never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse;
backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow
lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste,
something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which
never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these
silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in
the acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he
was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the
theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had
an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with
envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and
in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to
Cain’s heresy,” he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go to the
devil in his own way.” In this character, it was frequently his fortune
to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in
the lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came
about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.

No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative
at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar
catholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept
his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that
was the lawyer’s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those
whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the
growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt
the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman,
the well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what
these two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in
common. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday
walks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail
with obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two
men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief
jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but
even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them
uninterrupted.

It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a
by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is
called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The
inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to
do better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in
coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an
air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday,
when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of
passage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood,
like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters,
well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note,
instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger.

Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was
broken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain
sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It
was two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower
storey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore
in every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The
door, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered
and distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on
the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried
his knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had
appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their
ravages.

Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but
when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and
pointed.

“Did you ever remark that door?” he asked; and when his companion had
replied in the affirmative, “It is connected in my mind,” added he,
“with a very odd story.”

“Indeed?” said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, “and what
was that?”

“Well, it was this way,” returned Mr. Enfield: “I was coming home from
some place at the end of the world, about three o’clock of a black
winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was
literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the
folks asleep—street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession
and all as empty as a church—till at last I got into that state of mind
when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a
policeman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was
stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe
eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross
street. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the
corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man
trampled calmly over the child’s body and left her screaming on the
ground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn’t
like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa,
took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where
there was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was
perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly
that it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had
turned out were the girl’s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for
whom she had been sent put in his appearance. Well, the child was not
much the worse, more frightened, according to the sawbones; and there
you might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one
curious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first
sight. So had the child’s family, which was only natural. But the
doctor’s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry
apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh
accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the
rest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones
turn sick and white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his
mind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the
question, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would make
such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end
of London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we
undertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were
pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we
could for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such
hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of
black sneering coolness—frightened too, I could see that—but carrying
it off, sir, really like Satan. ‘If you choose to make capital out of
this accident,’ said he, ‘I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but
wishes to avoid a scene,’ says he. ‘Name your figure.’ Well, we screwed
him up to a hundred pounds for the child’s family; he would have
clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us
that meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to get
the money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with
the door?—whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the
matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts’s,
drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can’t mention,
though it’s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least
very well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the
signature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took
the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business
looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a
cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man’s
cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and
sneering. ‘Set your mind at rest,’ says he, ‘I will stay with you till
the banks open and cash the cheque myself.’ So we all set off, the
doctor, and the child’s father, and our friend and myself, and passed
the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had
breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself,
and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of
it. The cheque was genuine.”

“Tut-tut!” said Mr. Utterson.

“I see you feel as I do,” said Mr. Enfield. “Yes, it’s a bad story. For
my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really
damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of
the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your
fellows who do what they call good. Blackmail, I suppose; an honest man
paying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black Mail
House is what I call the place with the door, in consequence. Though
even that, you know, is far from explaining all,” he added, and with
the words fell into a vein of musing.

From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: “And
you don’t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?”

“A likely place, isn’t it?” returned Mr. Enfield. “But I happen to have
noticed his address; he lives in some square or other.”

“And you never asked about the—place with the door?” said Mr. Utterson.

“No, sir; I had a delicacy,” was the reply. “I feel very strongly about
putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of
judgment. You start a question, and it’s like starting a stone. You sit
quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others;
and presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of)
is knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to
change their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks
like Queer Street, the less I ask.”

“A very good rule, too,” said the lawyer.

“But I have studied the place for myself,” continued Mr. Enfield. “It
seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or
out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my
adventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first
floor; none below; the windows are always shut but they’re clean. And
then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must
live there. And yet it’s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed
together about the court, that it’s hard to say where one ends and
another begins.”

The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then “Enfield,”
said Mr. Utterson, “that’s a good rule of yours.”

“Yes, I think it is,” returned Enfield.

“But for all that,” continued the lawyer, “there’s one point I want to
ask. I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.”

“Well,” said Mr. Enfield, “I can’t see what harm it would do. It was a
man of the name of Hyde.”

“Hm,” said Mr. Utterson. “What sort of a man is he to see?”

“He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his
appearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I
never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be
deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I
couldn’t specify the point. He’s an extraordinary looking man, and yet
I really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand
of it; I can’t describe him. And it’s not want of memory; for I declare
I can see him this moment.”

Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a
weight of consideration. “You are sure he used a key?” he inquired at
last.

“My dear sir...” began Enfield, surprised out of himself.

“Yes, I know,” said Utterson; “I know it must seem strange. The fact
is, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I
know it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have
been inexact in any point you had better correct it.”

“I think you might have warned me,” returned the other with a touch of
sullenness. “But I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. The
fellow had a key; and what’s more, he has it still. I saw him use it
not a week ago.”

Mr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man
presently resumed. “Here is another lesson to say nothing,” said he. “I
am ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer to
this again.”

“With all my heart,” said the lawyer. “I shake hands on that, Richard.”



SEARCH FOR MR. HYDE

That evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre
spirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a
Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of
some dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the
neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go
soberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the
cloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business
room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a
document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll’s Will and sat down
with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for
Mr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had
refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided
not only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L.,
L.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands
of his “friend and benefactor Edward Hyde,” but that in case of Dr.
Jekyll’s “disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding
three calendar months,” the said Edward Hyde should step into the said
Henry Jekyll’s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or
obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the
doctor’s household. This document had long been the lawyer’s eyesore.
It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and
customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And
hitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his
indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was
already bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn
no more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable
attributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so
long baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment
of a fiend.

“I thought it was madness,” he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper
in the safe, “and now I begin to fear it is disgrace.”

With that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in
the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his
friend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding
patients. “If anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,” he had thought.

The solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage
of delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr.
Lanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper,
red-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a
boisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up
from his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was
the way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed
on genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at
school and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each
other, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each
other’s company.

After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so
disagreeably preoccupied his mind.

“I suppose, Lanyon,” said he, “you and I must be the two oldest friends
that Henry Jekyll has?”

“I wish the friends were younger,” chuckled Dr. Lanyon. “But I suppose
we are. And what of that? I see little of him now.”

“Indeed?” said Utterson. “I thought you had a bond of common interest.”

“We had,” was the reply. “But it is more than ten years since Henry
Jekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind;
and though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old
sake’s sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the
man. Such unscientific balderdash,” added the doctor, flushing suddenly
purple, “would have estranged Damon and Pythias.”

This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.
“They have only differed on some point of science,” he thought; and
being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of
conveyancing), he even added: “It is nothing worse than that!” He gave
his friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached
the question he had come to put. “Did you ever come across a _protégé_
of his—one Hyde?” he asked.

“Hyde?” repeated Lanyon. “No. Never heard of him. Since my time.”

That was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with
him to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the
small hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of
little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besieged
by questions.

Six o’clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently
near to Mr. Utterson’s dwelling, and still he was digging at the
problem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone;
but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he
lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained
room, Mr. Enfield’s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted
pictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal
city; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child
running from the doctor’s; and then these met, and that human
Juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams.
Or else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay
asleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that
room would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the
sleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure to
whom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do
its bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all
night; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide
more stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and
still the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of
lamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave
her screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know
it; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and
melted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew
apace in the lawyer’s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate,
curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but
once set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps
roll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well
examined. He might see a reason for his friend’s strange preference or
bondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of
the will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man
who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to
raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of
enduring hatred.

From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the
by-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when
business was plenty and time scarce, at night under the face of the
fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or
concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.

“If he be Mr. Hyde,” he had thought, “I shall be Mr. Seek.”

And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost
in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps,
unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By
ten o’clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very
solitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very
silent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses
were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of
the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson
had been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light
footstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had
long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of
a single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out
distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention
had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was
with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into
the entry of the court.

The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they
turned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry,
could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He was small and
very plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went
somehow strongly against the watcher’s inclination. But he made
straight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he
came, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home.

Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed.
“Mr. Hyde, I think?”

Mr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear
was only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face,
he answered coolly enough: “That is my name. What do you want?”

“I see you are going in,” returned the lawyer. “I am an old friend of
Dr. Jekyll’s—Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street—you must have heard of my
name; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.”

“You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,” replied Mr. Hyde,
blowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,
“How did you know me?” he asked.

“On your side,” said Mr. Utterson “will you do me a favour?”

“With pleasure,” replied the other. “What shall it be?”

“Will you let me see your face?” asked the lawyer.

Mr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden
reflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared
at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. “Now I shall know you
again,” said Mr. Utterson. “It may be useful.”

“Yes,” returned Mr. Hyde, “It is as well we have met; and _à propos_,
you should have my address.” And he gave a number of a street in Soho.

“Good God!” thought Mr. Utterson, “can he, too, have been thinking of
the will?” But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in
acknowledgment of the address.

“And now,” said the other, “how did you know me?”

“By description,” was the reply.

“Whose description?”

“We have common friends,” said Mr. Utterson.

“Common friends,” echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. “Who are they?”

“Jekyll, for instance,” said the lawyer.

“He never told you,” cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. “I did not
think you would have lied.”

“Come,” said Mr. Utterson, “that is not fitting language.”

The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with
extraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into
the house.

The lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of
disquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every
step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental
perplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a
class that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an
impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a
displeasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of
murderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky,
whispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against
him, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown
disgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. “There
must be something else,” said the perplexed gentleman. “There _is_
something more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man
seems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be
the old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul
that thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The
last, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan’s
signature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.”

Round the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient,
handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate
and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men;
map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure
enterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still
occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of
wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for
the fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly
servant opened the door.

“Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?” asked the lawyer.

“I will see, Mr. Utterson,” said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he
spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags,
warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire,
and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. “Will you wait here by the
fire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?”

“Here, thank you,” said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the
tall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy
of his friend the doctor’s; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of
it as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder
in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what
was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of
his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the
firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the
shadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently
returned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out.

“I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,” he said. “Is
that right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?”

“Quite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,” replied the servant. “Mr. Hyde has a
key.”

“Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man,
Poole,” resumed the other musingly.

“Yes, sir, he does indeed,” said Poole. “We have all orders to obey
him.”

“I do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?” asked Utterson.

“O, dear no, sir. He never _dines_ here,” replied the butler. “Indeed
we see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes
and goes by the laboratory.”

“Well, good-night, Poole.”

“Good-night, Mr. Utterson.”

And the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. “Poor Harry
Jekyll,” he thought, “my mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was
wild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of
God, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost
of some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment
coming, _pede claudo_, years after memory has forgotten and self-love
condoned the fault.” And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded
awhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least by
chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light
there. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of
their life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by
the many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and
fearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided.
And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of
hope. “This Master Hyde, if he were studied,” thought he, “must have
secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared
to which poor Jekyll’s worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot
continue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature
stealing like a thief to Harry’s bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening!
And the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the
will, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders to
the wheel—if Jekyll will but let me,” he added, “if Jekyll will only
let me.” For once more he saw before his mind’s eye, as clear as
transparency, the strange clauses of the will.



DR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE

A fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of
his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent,
reputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so
contrived that he remained behind after the others had departed. This
was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of
times. Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to
detain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had
already their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his
unobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in
the man’s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this
rule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite
side of the fire—a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with
something of a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and
kindness—you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson
a sincere and warm affection.

“I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,” began the latter. “You
know that will of yours?”

A close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful;
but the doctor carried it off gaily. “My poor Utterson,” said he, “you
are unfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed as
you were by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at
what he called my scientific heresies. O, I know he’s a good fellow—you
needn’t frown—an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of
him; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant.
I was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon.”

“You know I never approved of it,” pursued Utterson, ruthlessly
disregarding the fresh topic.

“My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,” said the doctor, a trifle
sharply. “You have told me so.”

“Well, I tell you so again,” continued the lawyer. “I have been
learning something of young Hyde.”

The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and
there came a blackness about his eyes. “I do not care to hear more,”
said he. “This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.”

“What I heard was abominable,” said Utterson.

“It can make no change. You do not understand my position,” returned
the doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. “I am painfully
situated, Utterson; my position is a very strange—a very strange one.
It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.”

“Jekyll,” said Utterson, “you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a
clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you
out of it.”

“My good Utterson,” said the doctor, “this is very good of you, this is
downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I
believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before
myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn’t what you fancy;
it is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I
will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde.
I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I
will just add one little word, Utterson, that I’m sure you’ll take in
good part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.”

Utterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.

“I have no doubt you are perfectly right,” he said at last, getting to
his feet.

“Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last
time I hope,” continued the doctor, “there is one point I should like
you to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde. I
know you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But I do
sincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if
I am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear
with him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew
all; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.”

“I can’t pretend that I shall ever like him,” said the lawyer.

“I don’t ask that,” pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other’s
arm; “I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake,
when I am no longer here.”

Utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. “Well,” said he, “I promise.”



THE CAREW MURDER CASE

Nearly a year later, in the month of October, 18—, London was startled
by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by
the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A
maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone
upstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in
the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the
lane, which the maid’s window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the
full moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon
her box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a
dream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she
narrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with all
men or thought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she became
aware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near
along the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small
gentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention. When they had come
within speech (which was just under the maid’s eyes) the older man
bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness.
It did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great
importance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if he
were only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he
spoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such
an innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something
high too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently her eye wandered
to the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr.
Hyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a
dislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling;
but he answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an
ill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he broke out in a
great flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and
carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentleman
took a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle
hurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to
the earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his
victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the
bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At
the horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted.

It was two o’clock when she came to herself and called for the police.
The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle
of the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been
done, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had
broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and
one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter—the other,
without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold
watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a
sealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the
post, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.

This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of
bed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than
he shot out a solemn lip. “I shall say nothing till I have seen the
body,” said he; “this may be very serious. Have the kindness to wait
while I dress.” And with the same grave countenance he hurried through
his breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had
been carried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.

“Yes,” said he, “I recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir
Danvers Carew.”

“Good God, sir,” exclaimed the officer, “is it possible?” And the next
moment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. “This will make a
deal of noise,” he said. “And perhaps you can help us to the man.” And
he briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken
stick.

Mr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the
stick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and
battered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself
presented many years before to Henry Jekyll.

“Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?” he inquired.

“Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid
calls him,” said the officer.

Mr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, “If you will come
with me in my cab,” he said, “I think I can take you to his house.”

It was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the
season. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the
wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so
that as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a
marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be
dark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich,
lurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here,
for a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of
daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal
quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy
ways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been
extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful
reinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer’s eyes, like a district
of some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of
the gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive,
he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law’s
officers, which may at times assail the most honest.

As the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a
little and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating
house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many
ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many
different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning
glass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part,
as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings.
This was the home of Henry Jekyll’s favourite; of a man who was heir to
a quarter of a million sterling.

An ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had an
evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent. Yes,
she said, this was Mr. Hyde’s, but he was not at home; he had been in
that night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour;
there was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and
he was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she
had seen him till yesterday.

“Very well, then, we wish to see his rooms,” said the lawyer; and when
the woman began to declare it was impossible, “I had better tell you
who this person is,” he added. “This is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland
Yard.”

A flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman’s face. “Ah!” said she,
“he is in trouble! What has he done?”

Mr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances. “He don’t seem a very
popular character,” observed the latter. “And now, my good woman, just
let me and this gentleman have a look about us.”

In the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained
otherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but these
were furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled with
wine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung
upon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who
was much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and
agreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark
of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the
floor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and
on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had
been burned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end
of a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the
other half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched
his suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A visit to the
bank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the
murderer’s credit, completed his gratification.

“You may depend upon it, sir,” he told Mr. Utterson: “I have him in my
hand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick
or, above all, burned the cheque book. Why, money’s life to the man. We
have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the
handbills.”

This last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde had
numbered few familiars—even the master of the servant maid had only
seen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been
photographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as
common observers will. Only on one point were they agreed; and that was
the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive
impressed his beholders.



INCIDENT OF THE LETTER

It was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr.
Jekyll’s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down
by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden,
to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or
dissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a
celebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than
anatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of
the garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in
that part of his friend’s quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless
structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of
strangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students
and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical
apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing
straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the
further end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red
baize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the
doctor’s cabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses,
furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business
table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred
with iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the
chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and
there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. He
did not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him
welcome in a changed voice.

“And now,” said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, “you have
heard the news?”

The doctor shuddered. “They were crying it in the square,” he said. “I
heard them in my dining-room.”

“One word,” said the lawyer. “Carew was my client, but so are you, and
I want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to hide
this fellow?”

“Utterson, I swear to God,” cried the doctor, “I swear to God I will
never set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done
with him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not
want my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite
safe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.”

The lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend’s feverish
manner. “You seem pretty sure of him,” said he; “and for your sake, I
hope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might appear.”

“I am quite sure of him,” replied Jekyll; “I have grounds for certainty
that I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which you
may advise me. I have—I have received a letter; and I am at a loss
whether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it in
your hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so
great a trust in you.”

“You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?” asked the
lawyer.

“No,” said the other. “I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I
am quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this
hateful business has rather exposed.”

Utterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend’s
selfishness, and yet relieved by it. “Well,” said he, at last, “let me
see the letter.”

The letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed “Edward
Hyde”: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer’s benefactor,
Dr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand
generosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had
means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked
this letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he
had looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.

“Have you the envelope?” he asked.

“I burned it,” replied Jekyll, “before I thought what I was about. But
it bore no postmark. The note was handed in.”

“Shall I keep this and sleep upon it?” asked Utterson.

“I wish you to judge for me entirely,” was the reply. “I have lost
confidence in myself.”

“Well, I shall consider,” returned the lawyer. “And now one word more:
it was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that
disappearance?”

The doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth
tight and nodded.

“I knew it,” said Utterson. “He meant to murder you. You had a fine
escape.”

“I have had what is far more to the purpose,” returned the doctor
solemnly: “I have had a lesson—O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have
had!” And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.

On his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole.
“By the bye,” said he, “there was a letter handed in to-day: what was
the messenger like?” But Poole was positive nothing had come except by
post; “and only circulars by that,” he added.

This news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the
letter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been
written in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently
judged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went,
were crying themselves hoarse along the footways: “Special edition.
Shocking murder of an M.P.” That was the funeral oration of one friend
and client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good
name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It
was, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and
self-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for
advice. It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it
might be fished for.

Presently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Guest,
his head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely
calculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine
that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house. The fog
still slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps
glimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these
fallen clouds, the procession of the town’s life was still rolling in
through the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the
room was gay with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long ago
resolved; the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows
richer in stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on
hillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs
of London. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom he
kept fewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that he
kept as many as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the
doctor’s; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr.
Hyde’s familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it
not as well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery
to right? and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic
of handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The
clerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a
document without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson
might shape his future course.

“This is a sad business about Sir Danvers,” he said.

“Yes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,”
returned Guest. “The man, of course, was mad.”

“I should like to hear your views on that,” replied Utterson. “I have a
document here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I scarce
know what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. But there
it is; quite in your way: a murderer’s autograph.”

Guest’s eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with
passion. “No sir,” he said: “not mad; but it is an odd hand.”

“And by all accounts a very odd writer,” added the lawyer.

Just then the servant entered with a note.

“Is that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?” inquired the clerk. “I thought I knew
the writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?”

“Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?”

“One moment. I thank you, sir;” and the clerk laid the two sheets of
paper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. “Thank you,
sir,” he said at last, returning both; “it’s a very interesting
autograph.”

There was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself.
“Why did you compare them, Guest?” he inquired suddenly.

“Well, sir,” returned the clerk, “there’s a rather singular
resemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only
differently sloped.”

“Rather quaint,” said Utterson.

“It is, as you say, rather quaint,” returned Guest.

“I wouldn’t speak of this note, you know,” said the master.

“No, sir,” said the clerk. “I understand.”

But no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked the
note into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. “What!” he
thought. “Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer!” And his blood ran cold in
his veins.



INCIDENT OF DR. LANYON

Time ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death
of Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde had
disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never
existed. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable:
tales came out of the man’s cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of
his vile life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to
have surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a
whisper. From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of
the murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on,
Mr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to
grow more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his
way of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde.
Now that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for
Dr. Jekyll. He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his
friends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and
whilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less
distinguished for religion. He was busy, he was much in the open air,
he did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward
consciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor was
at peace.

On the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor’s with a small
party; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked from
one to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable
friends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against
the lawyer. “The doctor was confined to the house,” Poole said, “and
saw no one.” On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and
having now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost
daily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The
fifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook
himself to Dr. Lanyon’s.

There at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he
was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor’s
appearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face. The
rosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly
balder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift
physical decay that arrested the lawyer’s notice, as a look in the eye
and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror
of the mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet
that was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. “Yes,” he thought; “he
is a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted;
and the knowledge is more than he can bear.” And yet when Utterson
remarked on his ill looks, it was with an air of great firmness that
Lanyon declared himself a doomed man.

“I have had a shock,” he said, “and I shall never recover. It is a
question of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir,
I used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more
glad to get away.”

“Jekyll is ill, too,” observed Utterson. “Have you seen him?”

But Lanyon’s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. “I wish to
see or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,” he said in a loud, unsteady voice.
“I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any
allusion to one whom I regard as dead.”

“Tut, tut!” said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause,
“Can’t I do anything?” he inquired. “We are three very old friends,
Lanyon; we shall not live to make others.”

“Nothing can be done,” returned Lanyon; “ask himself.”

“He will not see me,” said the lawyer.

“I am not surprised at that,” was the reply. “Some day, Utterson, after
I am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I
cannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me
of other things, for God’s sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep
clear of this accursed topic, then in God’s name, go, for I cannot bear
it.”

As soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll,
complaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of
this unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long
answer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious
in drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. “I do not blame our
old friend,” Jekyll wrote, “but I share his view that we must never
meet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you
must not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is
often shut even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I
have brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If
I am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could
not think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors
so unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this
destiny, and that is to respect my silence.” Utterson was amazed; the
dark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to
his old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with
every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment,
friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were
wrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but in
view of Lanyon’s manner and words, there must lie for it some deeper
ground.

A week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less
than a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which he
had been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room,
and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set
before him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal
of his dead friend. “PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE,
and in case of his predecease _to be destroyed unread_,” so it was
emphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the
contents. “I have buried one friend to-day,” he thought: “what if this
should cost me another?” And then he condemned the fear as a
disloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure,
likewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as “not to be opened till
the death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll.” Utterson could not
trust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad
will which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were the
idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in
the will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man
Hyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible.
Written by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A great curiosity
came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to
the bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his
dead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the
inmost corner of his private safe.

It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may
be doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his
surviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but
his thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but
he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart,
he preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by
the air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into
that house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its
inscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to
communicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined
himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes
even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not
read; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Utterson became so
used to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off
little by little in the frequency of his visits.



INCIDENT AT THE WINDOW

It chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr.
Enfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that
when they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.

“Well,” said Enfield, “that story’s at an end at least. We shall never
see more of Mr. Hyde.”

“I hope not,” said Utterson. “Did I ever tell you that I once saw him,
and shared your feeling of repulsion?”

“It was impossible to do the one without the other,” returned Enfield.
“And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that
this was a back way to Dr. Jekyll’s! It was partly your own fault that
I found it out, even when I did.”

“So you found it out, did you?” said Utterson. “But if that be so, we
may step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you the
truth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if
the presence of a friend might do him good.”

The court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature
twilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with
sunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and
sitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of
mien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.

“What! Jekyll!” he cried. “I trust you are better.”

“I am very low, Utterson,” replied the doctor drearily, “very low. It
will not last long, thank God.”

“You stay too much indoors,” said the lawyer. “You should be out,
whipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me. (This is my
cousin—Mr. Enfield—Dr. Jekyll.) Come now; get your hat and take a quick
turn with us.”

“You are very good,” sighed the other. “I should like to very much; but
no, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson, I
am very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask
you and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.”

“Why, then,” said the lawyer, good-naturedly, “the best thing we can do
is to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.”

“That is just what I was about to venture to propose,” returned the
doctor with a smile. But the words were hardly uttered, before the
smile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such
abject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen
below. They saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly
thrust down; but that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and
left the court without a word. In silence, too, they traversed the
by-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring
thoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings
of life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at his companion.
They were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their eyes.

“God forgive us, God forgive us,” said Mr. Utterson.

But Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once
more in silence.



THE LAST NIGHT

Mr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when
he was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.

“Bless me, Poole, what brings you here?” he cried; and then taking a
second look at him, “What ails you?” he added; “is the doctor ill?”

“Mr. Utterson,” said the man, “there is something wrong.”

“Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,” said the lawyer.
“Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.”

“You know the doctor’s ways, sir,” replied Poole, “and how he shuts
himself up. Well, he’s shut up again in the cabinet; and I don’t like
it, sir—I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I’m afraid.”

“Now, my good man,” said the lawyer, “be explicit. What are you afraid
of?”

“I’ve been afraid for about a week,” returned Poole, doggedly
disregarding the question, “and I can bear it no more.”

The man’s appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was altered
for the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced
his terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, he
sat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed
to a corner of the floor. “I can bear it no more,” he repeated.

“Come,” said the lawyer, “I see you have some good reason, Poole; I see
there is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is.”

“I think there’s been foul play,” said Poole, hoarsely.

“Foul play!” cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather
inclined to be irritated in consequence. “What foul play! What does the
man mean?”

“I daren’t say, sir,” was the answer; “but will you come along with me
and see for yourself?”

Mr. Utterson’s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat;
but he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared
upon the butler’s face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was
still untasted when he set it down to follow.

It was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying
on her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the
most diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and
flecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets
unusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had
never seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished it
otherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish
to see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there
was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The
square, when they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin
trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole,
who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the
middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off
his hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all
the hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he
wiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face
was white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.

“Well, sir,” he said, “here we are, and God grant there be nothing
wrong.”

“Amen, Poole,” said the lawyer.

Thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was
opened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, “Is that you,
Poole?”

“It’s all right,” said Poole. “Open the door.”

The hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was
built high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and
women, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of
Mr. Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the
cook, crying out “Bless God! it’s Mr. Utterson,” ran forward as if to
take him in her arms.

“What, what? Are you all here?” said the lawyer peevishly. “Very
irregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased.”

“They’re all afraid,” said Poole.

Blank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted her
voice and now wept loudly.

“Hold your tongue!” Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that
testified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so
suddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and
turned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. “And
now,” continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, “reach me a
candle, and we’ll get this through hands at once.” And then he begged
Mr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden.

“Now, sir,” said he, “you come as gently as you can. I want you to
hear, and I don’t want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any
chance he was to ask you in, don’t go.”

Mr. Utterson’s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk
that nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage
and followed the butler into the laboratory building through the
surgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of
the stair. Here Poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen;
while he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and
obvious call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a
somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door.

“Mr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you,” he called; and even as he did
so, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear.

A voice answered from within: “Tell him I cannot see anyone,” it said
complainingly.

“Thank you, sir,” said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in
his voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across
the yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the
beetles were leaping on the floor.

“Sir,” he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, “Was that my master’s
voice?”

“It seems much changed,” replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look
for look.

“Changed? Well, yes, I think so,” said the butler. “Have I been twenty
years in this man’s house, to be deceived about his voice? No, sir;
master’s made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we
heard him cry out upon the name of God; and _who’s_ in there instead of
him, and _why_ it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr.
Utterson!”

“This is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my
man,” said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. “Suppose it were as you
suppose, supposing Dr. Jekyll to have been—well, murdered, what could
induce the murderer to stay? That won’t hold water; it doesn’t commend
itself to reason.”

“Well, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I’ll do it
yet,” said Poole. “All this last week (you must know) him, or it,
whatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and
day for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It was
sometimes his way—the master’s, that is—to write his orders on a sheet
of paper and throw it on the stair. We’ve had nothing else this week
back; nothing but papers, and a closed door, and the very meals left
there to be smuggled in when nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day,
ay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders and
complaints, and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists
in town. Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be another
paper telling me to return it, because it was not pure, and another
order to a different firm. This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir,
whatever for.”

“Have you any of these papers?” asked Mr. Utterson.

Poole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the
lawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents
ran thus: “Dr. Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. He
assures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his
present purpose. In the year 18—, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large
quantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with most sedulous
care, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him at
once. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J. can
hardly be exaggerated.” So far the letter had run composedly enough,
but here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer’s emotion had
broken loose. “For God’s sake,” he added, “find me some of the old.”

“This is a strange note,” said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, “How do
you come to have it open?”

“The man at Maw’s was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like
so much dirt,” returned Poole.

“This is unquestionably the doctor’s hand, do you know?” resumed the
lawyer.

“I thought it looked like it,” said the servant rather sulkily; and
then, with another voice, “But what matters hand of write?” he said.
“I’ve seen him!”

“Seen him?” repeated Mr. Utterson. “Well?”

“That’s it!” said Poole. “It was this way. I came suddenly into the
theatre from the garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for this
drug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was
at the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up when
I came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet.
It was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my
head like quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon
his face? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and run
from me? I have served him long enough. And then...” The man paused and
passed his hand over his face.

“These are all very strange circumstances,” said Mr. Utterson, “but I
think I begin to see daylight. Your master, Poole, is plainly seized
with one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer;
hence, for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the mask
and the avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find this
drug, by means of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate
recovery—God grant that he be not deceived! There is my explanation; it
is sad enough, Poole, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain
and natural, hangs well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant
alarms.”

“Sir,” said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, “that
thing was not my master, and there’s the truth. My master”—here he
looked round him and began to whisper—“is a tall, fine build of a man,
and this was more of a dwarf.” Utterson attempted to protest. “O, sir,”
cried Poole, “do you think I do not know my master after twenty years?
Do you think I do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door,
where I saw him every morning of my life? No, sir, that thing in the
mask was never Dr. Jekyll—God knows what it was, but it was never Dr.
Jekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done.”

“Poole,” replied the lawyer, “if you say that, it will become my duty
to make certain. Much as I desire to spare your master’s feelings, much
as I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still
alive, I shall consider it my duty to break in that door.”

“Ah, Mr. Utterson, that’s talking!” cried the butler.

“And now comes the second question,” resumed Utterson: “Who is going to
do it?”

“Why, you and me, sir,” was the undaunted reply.

“That’s very well said,” returned the lawyer; “and whatever comes of
it, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser.”

“There is an axe in the theatre,” continued Poole; “and you might take
the kitchen poker for yourself.”

The lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and
balanced it. “Do you know, Poole,” he said, looking up, “that you and I
are about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?”

“You may say so, sir, indeed,” returned the butler.

“It is well, then that we should be frank,” said the other. “We both
think more than we have said; let us make a clean breast. This masked
figure that you saw, did you recognise it?”

“Well, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that
I could hardly swear to that,” was the answer. “But if you mean, was it
Mr. Hyde?—why, yes, I think it was! You see, it was much of the same
bigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who
else could have got in by the laboratory door? You have not forgot,
sir, that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him? But
that’s not all. I don’t know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr.
Hyde?”

“Yes,” said the lawyer, “I once spoke with him.”

“Then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something
queer about that gentleman—something that gave a man a turn—I don’t
know rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your
marrow kind of cold and thin.”

“I own I felt something of what you describe,” said Mr. Utterson.

“Quite so, sir,” returned Poole. “Well, when that masked thing like a
monkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, it
went down my spine like ice. O, I know it’s not evidence, Mr. Utterson;
I’m book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I
give you my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!”

“Ay, ay,” said the lawyer. “My fears incline to the same point. Evil, I
fear, founded—evil was sure to come—of that connection. Ay truly, I
believe you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer
(for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victim’s
room. Well, let our name be vengeance. Call Bradshaw.”

The footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.

“Pull yourself together, Bradshaw,” said the lawyer. “This suspense, I
know, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to make
an end of it. Poole, here, and I are going to force our way into the
cabinet. If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear the
blame. Meanwhile, lest anything should really be amiss, or any
malefactor seek to escape by the back, you and the boy must go round
the corner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the
laboratory door. We give you ten minutes to get to your stations.”

As Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. “And now, Poole, let
us get to ours,” he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the
way into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now
quite dark. The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that
deep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about
their steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where
they sat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; but
nearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a
footfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor.

“So it will walk all day, sir,” whispered Poole; “ay, and the better
part of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the chemist,
there’s a bit of a break. Ah, it’s an ill conscience that’s such an
enemy to rest! Ah, sir, there’s blood foully shed in every step of it!
But hark again, a little closer—put your heart in your ears, Mr.
Utterson, and tell me, is that the doctor’s foot?”

The steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they
went so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread
of Henry Jekyll. Utterson sighed. “Is there never anything else?” he
asked.

Poole nodded. “Once,” he said. “Once I heard it weeping!”

“Weeping? how that?” said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of
horror.

“Weeping like a woman or a lost soul,” said the butler. “I came away
with that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.”

But now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe from
under a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearest
table to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breath
to where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in
the quiet of the night.

“Jekyll,” cried Utterson, with a loud voice, “I demand to see you.” He
paused a moment, but there came no reply. “I give you fair warning, our
suspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you,” he resumed; “if
not by fair means, then by foul—if not of your consent, then by brute
force!”

“Utterson,” said the voice, “for God’s sake, have mercy!”

“Ah, that’s not Jekyll’s voice—it’s Hyde’s!” cried Utterson. “Down with
the door, Poole!”

Poole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, and
the red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal
screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the
axe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four
times the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of
excellent workmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lock
burst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet.

The besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had
succeeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the cabinet
before their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and
chattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a drawer
or two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearer
the fire, the things laid out for tea; the quietest room, you would
have said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most
commonplace that night in London.

Right in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and
still twitching. They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and
beheld the face of Edward Hyde. He was dressed in clothes far too large
for him, clothes of the doctor’s bigness; the cords of his face still
moved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone; and by the
crushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung
upon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a
self-destroyer.

“We have come too late,” he said sternly, “whether to save or punish.
Hyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the
body of your master.”

The far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre,
which filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above,
and by the cabinet, which formed an upper storey at one end and looked
upon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the
by-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a
second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a
spacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet
needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell
from their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was
filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon
who was Jekyll’s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they
were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a
perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance.
Nowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive.

Poole stamped on the flags of the corridor. “He must be buried here,”
he said, hearkening to the sound.

“Or he may have fled,” said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door
in the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they
found the key, already stained with rust.

“This does not look like use,” observed the lawyer.

“Use!” echoed Poole. “Do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if a
man had stamped on it.”

“Ay,” continued Utterson, “and the fractures, too, are rusty.” The two
men looked at each other with a scare. “This is beyond me, Poole,” said
the lawyer. “Let us go back to the cabinet.”

They mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional
awestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine
the contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of
chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on
glass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had
been prevented.

“That is the same drug that I was always bringing him,” said Poole; and
even as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over.

This brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn
cosily up, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter’s elbow, the
very sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one lay
beside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy
of a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great
esteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies.

Next, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came
to the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary
horror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow
playing on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along
the glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful
countenances stooping to look in.

“This glass has seen some strange things, sir,” whispered Poole.

“And surely none stranger than itself,” echoed the lawyer in the same
tones. “For what did Jekyll”—he caught himself up at the word with a
start, and then conquering the weakness—“what could Jekyll want with
it?” he said.

“You may say that!” said Poole.

Next they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat
array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the
doctor’s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and
several enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in
the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months
before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift
in case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the
lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John
Utterson. He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of
all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.

“My head goes round,” he said. “He has been all these days in
possession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see
himself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.”

He caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor’s hand
and dated at the top. “O Poole!” the lawyer cried, “he was alive and
here this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he
must be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how?
and in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must be
careful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire
catastrophe.”

“Why don’t you read it, sir?” asked Poole.

“Because I fear,” replied the lawyer solemnly. “God grant I have no
cause for it!” And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read
as follows:


“My dear Utterson,—When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have
disappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to
foresee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless
situation tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and
first read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your
hands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of

“Your unworthy and unhappy friend,

“HENRY JEKYLL.”


“There was a third enclosure?” asked Utterson.

“Here, sir,” said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packet
sealed in several places.

The lawyer put it in his pocket. “I would say nothing of this paper. If
your master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. It is
now ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall
be back before midnight, when we shall send for the police.”

They went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and
Utterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the
hall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which
this mystery was now to be explained.



DR. LANYON’S NARRATIVE

On the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening
delivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague
and old school companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good deal surprised by
this; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had
seen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could
imagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of
registration. The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the
letter ran:

“10_th December_, 18—.


“Dear Lanyon,—You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may
have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at
least on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day
when, if you had said to me, ‘Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason,
depend upon you,’ I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you.
Lanyon, my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you
fail me to-night, I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface,
that I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judge
for yourself.

“I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night—ay, even if
you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless
your carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in
your hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, my
butler, has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with a
locksmith. The door of my cabinet is then to be forced; and you are to
go in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand,
breaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, _with all its
contents as they stand_, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is
the same thing) the third from the bottom. In my extreme distress of
mind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in
error, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a
phial and a paper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you
to Cavendish Square exactly as it stands.

“That is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should
be back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before
midnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the
fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor
foreseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be
preferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have to
ask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own
hand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to
place in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from
my cabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude
completely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation,
you will have understood that these arrangements are of capital
importance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they
must appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or
the shipwreck of my reason.

“Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart
sinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility.
Think of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a
blackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware
that, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away
like a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Lanyon and save

“Your friend,


“H.J.


“P.S.—I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my
soul. It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter
not come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case, dear
Lanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the
course of the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight. It
may then already be too late; and if that night passes without event,
you will know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.”


Upon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane;
but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound
to do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less
I was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded
could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose
accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to
Jekyll’s house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by
the same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent
at once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we
were yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman’s surgical
theatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll’s private
cabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the
lock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and
have to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was
near despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour’s
work, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took
out the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and
returned with it to Cavendish Square.

Here I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly
enough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so
that it was plain they were of Jekyll’s private manufacture; and when I
opened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple
crystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned
my attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor,
which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to
contain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I
could make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book and
contained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many
years, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and
quite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date,
usually no more than a single word: “double” occurring perhaps six
times in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in the
list and followed by several marks of exclamation, “total failure!!!”
All this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was
definite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of
experiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll’s investigations) to
no end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these
articles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life
of my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one place, why
could he not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why was
this gentleman to be received by me in secret? The more I reflected the
more convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral
disease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old
revolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence.

Twelve o’clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded
very gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a
small man crouching against the pillars of the portico.

“Are you come from Dr. Jekyll?” I asked.

He told me “yes” by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him
enter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the
darkness of the square. There was a policeman not far off, advancing
with his bull’s eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitor
started and made greater haste.

These particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followed
him into the bright light of the consulting room, I kept my hand ready
on my weapon. Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. I
had never set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as
I have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his
face, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and
great apparent debility of constitution, and—last but not least—with
the odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This bore
some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked
sinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic,
personal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the
symptoms; but I have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much
deeper in the nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the
principle of hatred.

This person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance,
struck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was
dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable;
his clothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober
fabric, were enormously too large for him in every measurement—the
trousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to keep them from the
ground, the waist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar
sprawling wide upon his shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous
accoutrement was far from moving me to laughter. Rather, as there was
something abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature
that now faced me—something seizing, surprising and revolting—this
fresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that
to my interest in the man’s nature and character, there was added a
curiosity as to his origin, his life, his fortune and status in the
world.

These observations, though they have taken so great a space to be set
down in, were yet the work of a few seconds. My visitor was, indeed, on
fire with sombre excitement.

“Have you got it?” he cried. “Have you got it?” And so lively was his
impatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake
me.

I put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my
blood. “Come, sir,” said I. “You forget that I have not yet the
pleasure of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please.” And I showed
him an example, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as
fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness
of the hour, the nature of my preoccupations, and the horror I had of
my visitor, would suffer me to muster.

“I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,” he replied civilly enough. “What you
say is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my
politeness. I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Henry
Jekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I understood...” He
paused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his
collected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the
hysteria—“I understood, a drawer...”

But here I took pity on my visitor’s suspense, and some perhaps on my
own growing curiosity.

“There it is, sir,” said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the
floor behind a table and still covered with the sheet.

He sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart; I
could hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and
his face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his life
and reason.

“Compose yourself,” said I.

He turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of
despair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, he uttered
one loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified. And the next
moment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, “Have
you a graduated glass?” he asked.

I rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what he
asked.

He thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the red
tincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which was at first
of a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted, to
brighten in colour, to effervesce audibly, and to throw off small fumes
of vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition ceased and
the compound changed to a dark purple, which faded again more slowly to
a watery green. My visitor, who had watched these metamorphoses with a
keen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon the table, and then turned
and looked upon me with an air of scrutiny.

“And now,” said he, “to settle what remains. Will you be wise? will you
be guided? will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to go
forth from your house without further parley? or has the greed of
curiosity too much command of you? Think before you answer, for it
shall be done as you decide. As you decide, you shall be left as you
were before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service
rendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches
of the soul. Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province of
knowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you,
here, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted
by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.”

“Sir,” said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly
possessing, “you speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder that I
hear you with no very strong impression of belief. But I have gone too
far in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end.”

“It is well,” replied my visitor. “Lanyon, you remember your vows: what
follows is under the seal of our profession. And now, you who have so
long been bound to the most narrow and material views, you who have
denied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have derided your
superiors—behold!”

He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed; he
reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with
injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I
thought, a change—he seemed to swell—his face became suddenly black and
the features seemed to melt and alter—and the next moment, I had sprung
to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to shield
me from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.

“O God!” I screamed, and “O God!” again and again; for there before my
eyes—pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with
his hands, like a man restored from death—there stood Henry Jekyll!

What he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set on
paper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened at
it; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself if
I believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots;
sleep has left me; the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the
day and night; and I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must
die; and yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude that
man unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, I cannot, even in
memory, dwell on it without a start of horror. I will say but one
thing, Utterson, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it)
will be more than enough. The creature who crept into my house that
night was, on Jekyll’s own confession, known by the name of Hyde and
hunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of Carew.

HASTIE LANYON.




HENRY JEKYLL’S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE

I was born in the year 18— to a large fortune, endowed besides with
excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of
the wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been
supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished
future. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient
gaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such
as I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my
head high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the
public. Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that
when I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take
stock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already
committed to a profound duplicity of life. Many a man would have even
blazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high
views that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost
morbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of my
aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made me
what I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men,
severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound
man’s dual nature. In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and
inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of
religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though
so profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides
of me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside
restraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of
day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and
suffering. And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies,
which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and
shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my
members. With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the
moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth,
by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful
shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because
the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Others
will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard
the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of
multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my part,
from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in
one direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own person,
that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man;
I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my
consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was
only because I was radically both; and from an early date, even before
the course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most
naked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with
pleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of
these elements. If each, I told myself, could be housed in separate
identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the
unjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of
his more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely
on his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his
pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands
of this extraneous evil. It was the curse of mankind that these
incongruous faggots were thus bound together—that in the agonised womb
of consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling.
How, then were they dissociated?

I was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began
to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to
perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling
immateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body
in which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to
shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss
the curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter
deeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I
have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound
for ever on man’s shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it
off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful
pressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too
evident, my discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only
recognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain
of the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by
which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a
second form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me
because they were the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elements
in my soul.

I hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice. I
knew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled
and shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of
an overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition,
utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to
change. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at
last overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared my
tincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a
large quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments,
to be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I
compounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the
glass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of
courage, drank off the potion.

The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly
nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour
of birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I
came to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something
strange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its
very novelty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in
body; within I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of
disordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a
solution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent
freedom of the soul. I knew myself, at the first breath of this new
life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my
original evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me
like wine. I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of these
sensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost in
stature.

There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside
me as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose of
these transformations. The night however, was far gone into the
morning—the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the
conception of the day—the inmates of my house were locked in the most
rigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope
and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom. I
crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I
could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that
their unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through
the corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw
for the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.

I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but
that which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature,
to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust
and less developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in
the course of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of
effort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much
less exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde
was so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as
good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly
and plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still
believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint
of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in
the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of
welcome. This, too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes
it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and
single, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto
accustomed to call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have
observed that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come
near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as
I take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are
commingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of
mankind, was pure evil.

I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive
experiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had
lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a
house that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once
more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of
dissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the
stature and the face of Henry Jekyll.

That night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached my
discovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment while
under the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been
otherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth
an angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action; it
was neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the
prisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, that
which stood within ran forth. At that time my virtue slumbered; my
evil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the
occasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde. Hence,
although I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was
wholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that
incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already
learned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse.

Even at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a
life of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my
pleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well
known and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this
incoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome. It was on this
side that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had but to
drink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to
assume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde. I smiled at the
notion; it seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and I made my
preparations with the most studious care. I took and furnished that
house in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as
a housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent and
unscrupulous. On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr.
Hyde (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about my
house in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and made
myself a familiar object, in my second character. I next drew up that
will to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in
the person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde without
pecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I
began to profit by the strange immunities of my position.

Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own
person and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever did
so for his pleasures. I was the first that could plod in the public eye
with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a
schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of
liberty. But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was
complete. Think of it—I did not even exist! Let me but escape into my
laboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the
draught that I had always standing ready; and whatever he had done,
Edward Hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and
there in his stead, quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in his
study, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry
Jekyll.

The pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have
said, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the hands
of Edward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When I
would come back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind
of wonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar that I called out of
my own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being
inherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centered on
self; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture
to another; relentless like a man of stone. Henry Jekyll stood at times
aghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation was apart from
ordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. It was
Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty. Jekyll was no worse;
he woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even
make haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. And
thus his conscience slumbered.

Into the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now I
can scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of entering; I
mean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which
my chastisement approached. I met with one accident which, as it
brought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention. An act of
cruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I
recognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and
the child’s family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my
life; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward
Hyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in
the name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from
the future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Edward
Hyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied
my double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.

Some two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out for
one of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next
day in bed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain I looked about
me; in vain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room
in the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed
curtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept
insisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where I
seemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed to
sleep in the body of Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and in my
psychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this
illusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a
comfortable morning doze. I was still so engaged when, in one of my
more wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand. Now the hand of Henry
Jekyll (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and size;
it was large, firm, white and comely. But the hand which I now saw,
clearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half
shut on the bedclothes, was lean, corded, knuckly, of a dusky pallor
and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. It was the hand of
Edward Hyde.

I must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in the
mere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as sudden
and startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed I
rushed to the mirror. At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was
changed into something exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone to bed
Henry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde. How was this to be explained?
I asked myself; and then, with another bound of terror—how was it to be
remedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my
drugs were in the cabinet—a long journey down two pairs of stairs,
through the back passage, across the open court and through the
anatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck. It
might indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that,
when I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature? And then
with an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind
that the servants were already used to the coming and going of my
second self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of
my own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared
and drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange
array; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape
and was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of
breakfasting.

Small indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal
of my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the
wall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to
reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities
of my double existence. That part of me which I had the power of
projecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed
to me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature,
as though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous
tide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much
prolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown,
the power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edward
Hyde become irrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always
equally displayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed
me; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double,
and once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these
rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment.
Now, however, and in the light of that morning’s accident, I was led to
remark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw
off the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly
transferred itself to the other side. All things therefore seemed to
point to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better
self, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse.

Between these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had
memory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared
between them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive
apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the
pleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll,
or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in
which he conceals himself from pursuit. Jekyll had more than a father’s
interest; Hyde had more than a son’s indifference. To cast in my lot
with Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly
indulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was
to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a
blow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear
unequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for
while Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde
would be not even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my
circumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace
as man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any
tempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with
so vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was
found wanting in the strength to keep to it.

Yes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by
friends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to
the liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses
and secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde. I
made this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I
neither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward
Hyde, which still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, I
was true to my determination; for two months, I led a life of such
severity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the
compensations of an approving conscience. But time began at last to
obliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience began
to grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and
longings, as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour
of moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the
transforming draught.

I do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his
vice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that
he runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I,
long as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the
complete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which
were the leading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that I
was punished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was
conscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more
furious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that
stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to
the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God,
no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so
pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit
than that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I had
voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which
even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness
among temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was
to fall.

Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a transport of
glee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow;
and it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was
suddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a
cold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit;
and fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and
trembling, my lust of evil gratified and stimulated, my love of life
screwed to the topmost peg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make
assurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out through
the lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on
my crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still
hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger.
Hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he
drank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had not
done tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of
gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped
hands to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot. I
saw my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood,
when I had walked with my father’s hand, and through the self-denying
toils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same
sense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. I could have
screamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the
crowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against
me; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquity
stared into my soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die
away, it was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of my conduct was
solved. Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was
now confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced
to think of it! with what willing humility I embraced anew the
restrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation I locked
the door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key
under my heel!

The next day, came the news that the murder had been overlooked,
that the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was
a man high in public estimation. It was not only a crime, it had been a
tragic folly. I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have
my better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the
scaffold. Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an
instant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him.

I resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with
honesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know yourself
how earnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to
relieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and that the
days passed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can I truly say
that I wearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think instead
that I daily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with my
duality of purpose; and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, the
lower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to
growl for licence. Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bare
idea of that would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person
that I was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was
as an ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults of
temptation.

There comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled
at last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed the
balance of my soul. And yet I was not alarmed; the fall seemed natural,
like a return to the old days before I had made my discovery. It was a
fine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted,
but cloudless overhead; and the Regent’s Park was full of winter
chirrupings and sweet with spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench;
the animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a
little drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to
begin. After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I
smiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-will
with the lazy cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of that
vainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the
most deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then
as in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in
the temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a
solution of the bonds of obligation. I looked down; my clothes hung
formlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was
corded and hairy. I was once more Edward Hyde. A moment before I had
been safe of all men’s respect, wealthy, beloved—the cloth laying for
me in the dining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry of
mankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows.

My reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more than
once observed that in my second character, my faculties seemed
sharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came
about that, where Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to the
importance of the moment. My drugs were in one of the presses of my
cabinet; how was I to reach them? That was the problem that (crushing
my temples in my hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door I
had closed. If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants would
consign me to the gallows. I saw I must employ another hand, and
thought of Lanyon. How was he to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing
that I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way into
his presence? and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor,
prevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague,
Dr. Jekyll? Then I remembered that of my original character, one part
remained to me: I could write my own hand; and once I had conceived
that kindling spark, the way that I must follow became lighted up from
end to end.

Thereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a
passing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of which
I chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comical
enough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could
not conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of
devilish fury; and the smile withered from his face—happily for him—yet
more happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged
him from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so
black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they
exchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a
private room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger of
his life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung
to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature was
astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his
two important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he
might receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with
directions that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he sat all
day over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there he
dined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before
his eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the
corner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of
the city. He, I say—I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing
human; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at last,
thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab
and ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object
marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers,
these two base passions raged within him like a tempest. He walked
fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the
less frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided
him from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box
of lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled.

When I came to myself at Lanyon’s, the horror of my old friend perhaps
affected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in the
sea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon these hours. A
change had come over me. It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it
was the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I received Lanyon’s
condemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came
home to my own house and got into bed. I slept after the prostration of
the day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the
nightmares that wrung me could avail to break. I awoke in the morning
shaken, weakened, but refreshed. I still hated and feared the thought
of the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten
the appalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home,
in my own house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escape
shone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of
hope.

I was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the
chill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those
indescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the
time to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging
and freezing with the passions of Hyde. It took on this occasion a
double dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I sat
looking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be
re-administered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a
great effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation
of the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all
hours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory
shudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair,
it was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this
continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now
condemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I
became, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever,
languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one
thought: the horror of my other self. But when I slept, or when the
virtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition
(for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the
possession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling
with causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to
contain the raging energies of life. The powers of Hyde seemed to have
grown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly the hate that now
divided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it was a thing of
vital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity of that creature
that shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was
co-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which
in themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought
of Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish
but inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit
seemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated
and sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the
offices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to
him closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh,
where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every
hour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against
him, and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of
a different order. His terror of the gallows drove him continually to
commit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a
part instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed the
despondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and he resented the
dislike with which he was himself regarded. Hence the ape-like tricks
that he would play me, scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the
pages of my books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of
my father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of death, he would
long ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin. But
his love of life is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at
the mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion of
this attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off
by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him.

It is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this
description; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice;
and yet even to these, habit brought—no, not alleviation—but a certain
callousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and my
punishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity
which has now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own face
and nature. My provision of the salt, which had never been renewed
since the date of the first experiment, began to run low. I sent out
for a fresh supply and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and
the first change of colour, not the second; I drank it and it was
without efficiency. You will learn from Poole how I have had London
ransacked; it was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my first supply
was impure, and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy
to the draught.

About a week has passed, and I am now finishing this statement under
the influence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the last
time, short of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think his own thoughts
or see his own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must I
delay too long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative has
hitherto escaped destruction, it has been by a combination of great
prudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change take me in
the act of writing it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time
shall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness
and circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from
the action of his ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closing
on us both has already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from now,
when I shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, I know
how I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue, with
the most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening, to pace up and
down this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound of
menace. Will Hyde die upon the scaffold? or will he find courage to
release himself at the last moment? God knows; I am careless; this is
my true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than
myself. Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my
confession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.

"﻿CHAPTER I

I SET OFF UPON MY JOURNEY TO THE HOUSE OF SHAWS

I will begin the story of my adventures with a certain morning early in
the month of June, the year of grace 1751, when I took the key for the
last time out of the door of my father’s house. The sun began to shine
upon the summit of the hills as I went down the road; and by the time
I had come as far as the manse, the blackbirds were whistling in the
garden lilacs, and the mist that hung around the valley in the time of
the dawn was beginning to arise and die away.

Mr. Campbell, the minister of Essendean, was waiting for me by the
garden gate, good man! He asked me if I had breakfasted; and hearing
that I lacked for nothing, he took my hand in both of his and clapped it
kindly under his arm.

“Well, Davie, lad,” said he, “I will go with you as far as the ford, to
set you on the way.” And we began to walk forward in silence.

“Are ye sorry to leave Essendean?” said he, after awhile.

“Why, sir,” said I, “if I knew where I was going, or what was likely
to become of me, I would tell you candidly. Essendean is a good place
indeed, and I have been very happy there; but then I have never been
anywhere else. My father and mother, since they are both dead, I shall
be no nearer to in Essendean than in the Kingdom of Hungary, and, to
speak truth, if I thought I had a chance to better myself where I was
going I would go with a good will.”

“Ay?” said Mr. Campbell. “Very well, Davie. Then it behoves me to tell
your fortune; or so far as I may. When your mother was gone, and your
father (the worthy, Christian man) began to sicken for his end, he gave
me in charge a certain letter, which he said was your inheritance. ‘So
soon,’ says he, ‘as I am gone, and the house is redd up and the gear
disposed of’ (all which, Davie, hath been done), ‘give my boy this
letter into his hand, and start him off to the house of Shaws, not far
from Cramond. That is the place I came from,’ he said, ‘and it’s where
it befits that my boy should return. He is a steady lad,’ your father
said, ‘and a canny goer; and I doubt not he will come safe, and be well
lived where he goes.’”

“The house of Shaws!” I cried. “What had my poor father to do with the
house of Shaws?”

“Nay,” said Mr. Campbell, “who can tell that for a surety? But the name
of that family, Davie, boy, is the name you bear--Balfours of Shaws:
an ancient, honest, reputable house, peradventure in these latter
days decayed. Your father, too, was a man of learning as befitted his
position; no man more plausibly conducted school; nor had he the manner
or the speech of a common dominie; but (as ye will yourself remember)
I took aye a pleasure to have him to the manse to meet the gentry; and
those of my own house, Campbell of Kilrennet, Campbell of Dunswire,
Campbell of Minch, and others, all well-kenned gentlemen, had pleasure
in his society. Lastly, to put all the elements of this affair before
you, here is the testamentary letter itself, superscrived by the own
hand of our departed brother.”

He gave me the letter, which was addressed in these words: “To the hands
of Ebenezer Balfour, Esquire, of Shaws, in his house of Shaws, these
will be delivered by my son, David Balfour.” My heart was beating hard
at this great prospect now suddenly opening before a lad of seventeen
years of age, the son of a poor country dominie in the Forest of
Ettrick.

“Mr. Campbell,” I stammered, “and if you were in my shoes, would you
go?”

“Of a surety,” said the minister, “that would I, and without pause.
A pretty lad like you should get to Cramond (which is near in by
Edinburgh) in two days of walk. If the worst came to the worst, and
your high relations (as I cannot but suppose them to be somewhat of your
blood) should put you to the door, ye can but walk the two days back
again and risp at the manse door. But I would rather hope that ye shall
be well received, as your poor father forecast for you, and for anything
that I ken come to be a great man in time. And here, Davie, laddie,” he
resumed, “it lies near upon my conscience to improve this parting, and
set you on the right guard against the dangers of the world.”

Here he cast about for a comfortable seat, lighted on a big boulder
under a birch by the trackside, sate down upon it with a very long,
serious upper lip, and the sun now shining in upon us between two peaks,
put his pocket-handkerchief over his cocked hat to shelter him. There,
then, with uplifted forefinger, he first put me on my guard against a
considerable number of heresies, to which I had no temptation, and urged
upon me to be instant in my prayers and reading of the Bible. That done,
he drew a picture of the great house that I was bound to, and how I
should conduct myself with its inhabitants.

“Be soople, Davie, in things immaterial,” said he. “Bear ye this in
mind, that, though gentle born, ye have had a country rearing. Dinnae
shame us, Davie, dinnae shame us! In yon great, muckle house, with all
these domestics, upper and under, show yourself as nice, as circumspect,
as quick at the conception, and as slow of speech as any. As for the
laird--remember he’s the laird; I say no more: honour to whom honour.
It’s a pleasure to obey a laird; or should be, to the young.”

“Well, sir,” said I, “it may be; and I’ll promise you I’ll try to make
it so.”

“Why, very well said,” replied Mr. Campbell, heartily. “And now to come
to the material, or (to make a quibble) to the immaterial. I have here
a little packet which contains four things.” He tugged it, as he spoke,
and with some great difficulty, from the skirt pocket of his coat. “Of
these four things, the first is your legal due: the little pickle money
for your father’s books and plenishing, which I have bought (as I have
explained from the first) in the design of re-selling at a profit to
the incoming dominie. The other three are gifties that Mrs. Campbell and
myself would be blithe of your acceptance. The first, which is round,
will likely please ye best at the first off-go; but, O Davie, laddie,
it’s but a drop of water in the sea; it’ll help you but a step, and
vanish like the morning. The second, which is flat and square and
written upon, will stand by you through life, like a good staff for the
road, and a good pillow to your head in sickness. And as for the last,
which is cubical, that’ll see you, it’s my prayerful wish, into a better
land.”

With that he got upon his feet, took off his hat, and prayed a little
while aloud, and in affecting terms, for a young man setting out into
the world; then suddenly took me in his arms and embraced me very hard;
then held me at arm’s length, looking at me with his face all working
with sorrow; and then whipped about, and crying good-bye to me, set off
backward by the way that we had come at a sort of jogging run. It might
have been laughable to another; but I was in no mind to laugh. I watched
him as long as he was in sight; and he never stopped hurrying, nor once
looked back. Then it came in upon my mind that this was all his sorrow
at my departure; and my conscience smote me hard and fast, because I,
for my part, was overjoyed to get away out of that quiet country-side,
and go to a great, busy house, among rich and respected gentlefolk of my
own name and blood.

“Davie, Davie,” I thought, “was ever seen such black ingratitude? Can
you forget old favours and old friends at the mere whistle of a name?
Fie, fie; think shame.”

And I sat down on the boulder the good man had just left, and opened the
parcel to see the nature of my gifts. That which he had called cubical,
I had never had much doubt of; sure enough it was a little Bible, to
carry in a plaid-neuk. That which he had called round, I found to be a
shilling piece; and the third, which was to help me so wonderfully both
in health and sickness all the days of my life, was a little piece of
coarse yellow paper, written upon thus in red ink:


“TO MAKE LILLY OF THE VALLEY WATER.--Take the flowers of lilly of the
valley and distil them in sack, and drink a spooneful or two as there is
occasion. It restores speech to those that have the dumb palsey. It is
good against the Gout; it comforts the heart and strengthens the memory;
and the flowers, put into a Glasse, close stopt, and set into ane hill
of ants for a month, then take it out, and you will find a liquor which
comes from the flowers, which keep in a vial; it is good, ill or well,
and whether man or woman.”



And then, in the minister’s own hand, was added:

“Likewise for sprains, rub it in; and for the cholic, a great spooneful
in the hour.”


To be sure, I laughed over this; but it was rather tremulous laughter;
and I was glad to get my bundle on my staff’s end and set out over the
ford and up the hill upon the farther side; till, just as I came on the
green drove-road running wide through the heather, I took my last look
of Kirk Essendean, the trees about the manse, and the big rowans in the
kirkyard where my father and my mother lay.




CHAPTER II

I COME TO MY JOURNEY’S END

On the forenoon of the second day, coming to the top of a hill, I saw
all the country fall away before me down to the sea; and in the midst
of this descent, on a long ridge, the city of Edinburgh smoking like
a kiln. There was a flag upon the castle, and ships moving or lying
anchored in the firth; both of which, for as far away as they were, I
could distinguish clearly; and both brought my country heart into my
mouth.

Presently after, I came by a house where a shepherd lived, and got a
rough direction for the neighbourhood of Cramond; and so, from one to
another, worked my way to the westward of the capital by Colinton, till
I came out upon the Glasgow road. And there, to my great pleasure and
wonder, I beheld a regiment marching to the fifes, every foot in time;
an old red-faced general on a grey horse at the one end, and at the
other the company of Grenadiers, with their Pope’s-hats. The pride of
life seemed to mount into my brain at the sight of the red coats and the
hearing of that merry music.

A little farther on, and I was told I was in Cramond parish, and began
to substitute in my inquiries the name of the house of Shaws. It was a
word that seemed to surprise those of whom I sought my way. At first I
thought the plainness of my appearance, in my country habit, and that
all dusty from the road, consorted ill with the greatness of the place
to which I was bound. But after two, or maybe three, had given me the
same look and the same answer, I began to take it in my head there was
something strange about the Shaws itself.

The better to set this fear at rest, I changed the form of my inquiries;
and spying an honest fellow coming along a lane on the shaft of his
cart, I asked him if he had ever heard tell of a house they called the
house of Shaws.

He stopped his cart and looked at me, like the others.

“Ay” said he. “What for?”

“It’s a great house?” I asked.

“Doubtless,” says he. “The house is a big, muckle house.”

“Ay,” said I, “but the folk that are in it?”

“Folk?” cried he. “Are ye daft? There’s nae folk there--to call folk.”

“What?” say I; “not Mr. Ebenezer?”

“Ou, ay” says the man; “there’s the laird, to be sure, if it’s him
you’re wanting. What’ll like be your business, mannie?”

“I was led to think that I would get a situation,” I said, looking as
modest as I could.

“What?” cries the carter, in so sharp a note that his very horse
started; and then, “Well, mannie,” he added, “it’s nane of my affairs;
but ye seem a decent-spoken lad; and if ye’ll take a word from me, ye’ll
keep clear of the Shaws.”

The next person I came across was a dapper little man in a beautiful
white wig, whom I saw to be a barber on his rounds; and knowing well
that barbers were great gossips, I asked him plainly what sort of a man
was Mr. Balfour of the Shaws.

“Hoot, hoot, hoot,” said the barber, “nae kind of a man, nae kind of a
man at all;” and began to ask me very shrewdly what my business was;
but I was more than a match for him at that, and he went on to his next
customer no wiser than he came.

I cannot well describe the blow this dealt to my illusions. The more
indistinct the accusations were, the less I liked them, for they left
the wider field to fancy. What kind of a great house was this, that all
the parish should start and stare to be asked the way to it? or what
sort of a gentleman, that his ill-fame should be thus current on the
wayside? If an hour’s walking would have brought me back to Essendean, I
had left my adventure then and there, and returned to Mr. Campbell’s.
But when I had come so far a way already, mere shame would not suffer me
to desist till I had put the matter to the touch of proof; I was bound,
out of mere self-respect, to carry it through; and little as I liked
the sound of what I heard, and slow as I began to travel, I still kept
asking my way and still kept advancing.

It was drawing on to sundown when I met a stout, dark, sour-looking
woman coming trudging down a hill; and she, when I had put my usual
question, turned sharp about, accompanied me back to the summit she had
just left, and pointed to a great bulk of building standing very bare
upon a green in the bottom of the next valley. The country was pleasant
round about, running in low hills, pleasantly watered and wooded, and
the crops, to my eyes, wonderfully good; but the house itself appeared
to be a kind of ruin; no road led up to it; no smoke arose from any of
the chimneys; nor was there any semblance of a garden. My heart sank.
“That!” I cried.

The woman’s face lit up with a malignant anger. “That is the house of
Shaws!” she cried. “Blood built it; blood stopped the building of it;
blood shall bring it down. See here!” she cried again--“I spit upon
the ground, and crack my thumb at it! Black be its fall! If ye see the
laird, tell him what ye hear; tell him this makes the twelve hunner and
nineteen time that Jennet Clouston has called down the curse on him
and his house, byre and stable, man, guest, and master, wife, miss, or
bairn--black, black be their fall!”

And the woman, whose voice had risen to a kind of eldritch sing-song,
turned with a skip, and was gone. I stood where she left me, with my
hair on end. In those days folk still believed in witches and trembled
at a curse; and this one, falling so pat, like a wayside omen, to arrest
me ere I carried out my purpose, took the pith out of my legs.

I sat me down and stared at the house of Shaws. The more I looked,
the pleasanter that country-side appeared; being all set with hawthorn
bushes full of flowers; the fields dotted with sheep; a fine flight of
rooks in the sky; and every sign of a kind soil and climate; and yet the
barrack in the midst of it went sore against my fancy.

Country folk went by from the fields as I sat there on the side of the
ditch, but I lacked the spirit to give them a good-e’en. At last the sun
went down, and then, right up against the yellow sky, I saw a scroll of
smoke go mounting, not much thicker, as it seemed to me, than the smoke
of a candle; but still there it was, and meant a fire, and warmth, and
cookery, and some living inhabitant that must have lit it; and this
comforted my heart.

So I set forward by a little faint track in the grass that led in my
direction. It was very faint indeed to be the only way to a place
of habitation; yet I saw no other. Presently it brought me to stone
uprights, with an unroofed lodge beside them, and coats of arms upon
the top. A main entrance it was plainly meant to be, but never finished;
instead of gates of wrought iron, a pair of hurdles were tied across
with a straw rope; and as there were no park walls, nor any sign of
avenue, the track that I was following passed on the right hand of the
pillars, and went wandering on toward the house.

The nearer I got to that, the drearier it appeared. It seemed like the
one wing of a house that had never been finished. What should have been
the inner end stood open on the upper floors, and showed against the sky
with steps and stairs of uncompleted masonry. Many of the windows were
unglazed, and bats flew in and out like doves out of a dove-cote.

The night had begun to fall as I got close; and in three of the lower
windows, which were very high up and narrow, and well barred, the
changing light of a little fire began to glimmer. Was this the palace
I had been coming to? Was it within these walls that I was to seek
new friends and begin great fortunes? Why, in my father’s house on
Essen-Waterside, the fire and the bright lights would show a mile away,
and the door open to a beggar’s knock!

I came forward cautiously, and giving ear as I came, heard some one
rattling with dishes, and a little dry, eager cough that came in fits;
but there was no sound of speech, and not a dog barked.

The door, as well as I could see it in the dim light, was a great piece
of wood all studded with nails; and I lifted my hand with a faint heart
under my jacket, and knocked once. Then I stood and waited. The house
had fallen into a dead silence; a whole minute passed away, and nothing
stirred but the bats overhead. I knocked again, and hearkened again.
By this time my ears had grown so accustomed to the quiet, that I
could hear the ticking of the clock inside as it slowly counted out the
seconds; but whoever was in that house kept deadly still, and must have
held his breath.

I was in two minds whether to run away; but anger got the upper hand,
and I began instead to rain kicks and buffets on the door, and to shout
out aloud for Mr. Balfour. I was in full career, when I heard the cough
right overhead, and jumping back and looking up, beheld a man’s head
in a tall nightcap, and the bell mouth of a blunderbuss, at one of the
first-storey windows.

“It’s loaded,” said a voice.

“I have come here with a letter,” I said, “to Mr. Ebenezer Balfour of
Shaws. Is he here?”

“From whom is it?” asked the man with the blunderbuss.

“That is neither here nor there,” said I, for I was growing very wroth.

“Well,” was the reply, “ye can put it down upon the doorstep, and be off
with ye.”

“I will do no such thing,” I cried. “I will deliver it into Mr.
Balfour’s hands, as it was meant I should. It is a letter of
introduction.”

“A what?” cried the voice, sharply.

I repeated what I had said.

“Who are ye, yourself?” was the next question, after a considerable
pause.

“I am not ashamed of my name,” said I. “They call me David Balfour.”

At that, I made sure the man started, for I heard the blunderbuss rattle
on the window-sill; and it was after quite a long pause, and with a
curious change of voice, that the next question followed:

“Is your father dead?”

I was so much surprised at this, that I could find no voice to answer,
but stood staring.

“Ay,” the man resumed, “he’ll be dead, no doubt; and that’ll be what
brings ye chapping to my door.” Another pause, and then defiantly,
“Well, man,” he said, “I’ll let ye in;” and he disappeared from the
window.




CHAPTER III

I MAKE ACQUAINTANCE OF MY UNCLE

Presently there came a great rattling of chains and bolts, and the
door was cautiously opened and shut to again behind me as soon as I had
passed.

“Go into the kitchen and touch naething,” said the voice; and while the
person of the house set himself to replacing the defences of the door, I
groped my way forward and entered the kitchen.

The fire had burned up fairly bright, and showed me the barest room I
think I ever put my eyes on. Half-a-dozen dishes stood upon the shelves;
the table was laid for supper with a bowl of porridge, a horn spoon, and
a cup of small beer. Besides what I have named, there was not another
thing in that great, stone-vaulted, empty chamber but lockfast chests
arranged along the wall and a corner cupboard with a padlock.

As soon as the last chain was up, the man rejoined me. He was a mean,
stooping, narrow-shouldered, clay-faced creature; and his age might have
been anything between fifty and seventy. His nightcap was of flannel,
and so was the nightgown that he wore, instead of coat and waistcoat,
over his ragged shirt. He was long unshaved; but what most distressed
and even daunted me, he would neither take his eyes away from me nor
look me fairly in the face. What he was, whether by trade or birth, was
more than I could fathom; but he seemed most like an old, unprofitable
serving-man, who should have been left in charge of that big house upon
board wages.

“Are ye sharp-set?” he asked, glancing at about the level of my knee.
“Ye can eat that drop parritch?”

I said I feared it was his own supper.

“O,” said he, “I can do fine wanting it. I’ll take the ale, though, for
it slockens (moistens) my cough.” He drank the cup about half out, still
keeping an eye upon me as he drank; and then suddenly held out his hand.
“Let’s see the letter,” said he.

I told him the letter was for Mr. Balfour; not for him.

“And who do ye think I am?” says he. “Give me Alexander’s letter.”

“You know my father’s name?”

“It would be strange if I didnae,” he returned, “for he was my born
brother; and little as ye seem to like either me or my house, or my good
parritch, I’m your born uncle, Davie, my man, and you my born nephew. So
give us the letter, and sit down and fill your kyte.”

If I had been some years younger, what with shame, weariness, and
disappointment, I believe I had burst into tears. As it was, I could
find no words, neither black nor white, but handed him the letter, and
sat down to the porridge with as little appetite for meat as ever a
young man had.

Meanwhile, my uncle, stooping over the fire, turned the letter over and
over in his hands.

“Do ye ken what’s in it?” he asked, suddenly.

“You see for yourself, sir,” said I, “that the seal has not been
broken.”

“Ay,” said he, “but what brought you here?”

“To give the letter,” said I.

“No,” says he, cunningly, “but ye’ll have had some hopes, nae doubt?”

“I confess, sir,” said I, “when I was told that I had kinsfolk
well-to-do, I did indeed indulge the hope that they might help me in
my life. But I am no beggar; I look for no favours at your hands, and
I want none that are not freely given. For as poor as I appear, I have
friends of my own that will be blithe to help me.”

“Hoot-toot!” said Uncle Ebenezer, “dinnae fly up in the snuff at me.
We’ll agree fine yet. And, Davie, my man, if you’re done with that bit
parritch, I could just take a sup of it myself. Ay,” he continued,
as soon as he had ousted me from the stool and spoon, “they’re fine,
halesome food--they’re grand food, parritch.” He murmured a little grace
to himself and fell to. “Your father was very fond of his meat, I mind;
he was a hearty, if not a great eater; but as for me, I could never
do mair than pyke at food.” He took a pull at the small beer, which
probably reminded him of hospitable duties, for his next speech ran
thus: “If ye’re dry ye’ll find water behind the door.”

To this I returned no answer, standing stiffly on my two feet, and
looking down upon my uncle with a mighty angry heart. He, on his part,
continued to eat like a man under some pressure of time, and to throw
out little darting glances now at my shoes and now at my home-spun
stockings. Once only, when he had ventured to look a little higher, our
eyes met; and no thief taken with a hand in a man’s pocket could have
shown more lively signals of distress. This set me in a muse, whether
his timidity arose from too long a disuse of any human company; and
whether perhaps, upon a little trial, it might pass off, and my uncle
change into an altogether different man. From this I was awakened by his
sharp voice.

“Your father’s been long dead?” he asked.

“Three weeks, sir,” said I.

“He was a secret man, Alexander--a secret, silent man,” he continued.
“He never said muckle when he was young. He’ll never have spoken muckle
of me?”

“I never knew, sir, till you told it me yourself, that he had any
brother.”

“Dear me, dear me!” said Ebenezer. “Nor yet of Shaws, I dare say?”

“Not so much as the name, sir,” said I.

“To think o’ that!” said he. “A strange nature of a man!” For all that,
he seemed singularly satisfied, but whether with himself, or me, or
with this conduct of my father’s, was more than I could read. Certainly,
however, he seemed to be outgrowing that distaste, or ill-will, that he
had conceived at first against my person; for presently he jumped up,
came across the room behind me, and hit me a smack upon the shoulder.
“We’ll agree fine yet!” he cried. “I’m just as glad I let you in. And
now come awa’ to your bed.”

To my surprise, he lit no lamp or candle, but set forth into the dark
passage, groped his way, breathing deeply, up a flight of steps, and
paused before a door, which he unlocked. I was close upon his heels,
having stumbled after him as best I might; and then he bade me go in,
for that was my chamber. I did as he bid, but paused after a few steps,
and begged a light to go to bed with.

“Hoot-toot!” said Uncle Ebenezer, “there’s a fine moon.”

“Neither moon nor star, sir, and pit-mirk,” * said I. “I cannae see the
bed.”

     * Dark as the pit.

“Hoot-toot, hoot-toot!” said he. “Lights in a house is a thing I dinnae
agree with. I’m unco feared of fires. Good-night to ye, Davie, my man.”
 And before I had time to add a further protest, he pulled the door to,
and I heard him lock me in from the outside.

I did not know whether to laugh or cry. The room was as cold as a well,
and the bed, when I had found my way to it, as damp as a peat-hag; but
by good fortune I had caught up my bundle and my plaid, and rolling
myself in the latter, I lay down upon the floor under lee of the big
bedstead, and fell speedily asleep.

With the first peep of day I opened my eyes, to find myself in a great
chamber, hung with stamped leather, furnished with fine embroidered
furniture, and lit by three fair windows. Ten years ago, or perhaps
twenty, it must have been as pleasant a room to lie down or to awake in
as a man could wish; but damp, dirt, disuse, and the mice and spiders
had done their worst since then. Many of the window-panes, besides, were
broken; and indeed this was so common a feature in that house, that I
believe my uncle must at some time have stood a siege from his indignant
neighbours--perhaps with Jennet Clouston at their head.

Meanwhile the sun was shining outside; and being very cold in that
miserable room, I knocked and shouted till my gaoler came and let me
out. He carried me to the back of the house, where was a draw-well, and
told me to “wash my face there, if I wanted;” and when that was done,
I made the best of my own way back to the kitchen, where he had lit the
fire and was making the porridge. The table was laid with two bowls and
two horn spoons, but the same single measure of small beer. Perhaps my
eye rested on this particular with some surprise, and perhaps my uncle
observed it; for he spoke up as if in answer to my thought, asking me if
I would like to drink ale--for so he called it.

I told him such was my habit, but not to put himself about.

“Na, na,” said he; “I’ll deny you nothing in reason.”

He fetched another cup from the shelf; and then, to my great surprise,
instead of drawing more beer, he poured an accurate half from one cup
to the other. There was a kind of nobleness in this that took my breath
away; if my uncle was certainly a miser, he was one of that thorough
breed that goes near to make the vice respectable.

When we had made an end of our meal, my uncle Ebenezer unlocked a
drawer, and drew out of it a clay pipe and a lump of tobacco, from which
he cut one fill before he locked it up again. Then he sat down in the
sun at one of the windows and silently smoked. From time to time his
eyes came coasting round to me, and he shot out one of his questions.
Once it was, “And your mother?” and when I had told him that she, too,
was dead, “Ay, she was a bonnie lassie!” Then, after another long pause,
“Whae were these friends o’ yours?”

I told him they were different gentlemen of the name of Campbell;
though, indeed, there was only one, and that the minister, that had ever
taken the least note of me; but I began to think my uncle made too light
of my position, and finding myself all alone with him, I did not wish
him to suppose me helpless.

He seemed to turn this over in his mind; and then, “Davie, my man,” said
he, “ye’ve come to the right bit when ye came to your uncle Ebenezer.
I’ve a great notion of the family, and I mean to do the right by you;
but while I’m taking a bit think to mysel’ of what’s the best thing to
put you to--whether the law, or the meenistry, or maybe the army, whilk
is what boys are fondest of--I wouldnae like the Balfours to be humbled
before a wheen Hieland Campbells, and I’ll ask you to keep your tongue
within your teeth. Nae letters; nae messages; no kind of word to
onybody; or else--there’s my door.”

“Uncle Ebenezer,” said I, “I’ve no manner of reason to suppose you mean
anything but well by me. For all that, I would have you to know that I
have a pride of my own. It was by no will of mine that I came seeking
you; and if you show me your door again, I’ll take you at the word.”

He seemed grievously put out. “Hoots-toots,” said he, “ca’ cannie,
man--ca’ cannie! Bide a day or two. I’m nae warlock, to find a fortune
for you in the bottom of a parritch bowl; but just you give me a day or
two, and say naething to naebody, and as sure as sure, I’ll do the right
by you.”

“Very well,” said I, “enough said. If you want to help me, there’s no
doubt but I’ll be glad of it, and none but I’ll be grateful.”

It seemed to me (too soon, I dare say) that I was getting the upper
hand of my uncle; and I began next to say that I must have the bed and
bedclothes aired and put to sun-dry; for nothing would make me sleep in
such a pickle.

“Is this my house or yours?” said he, in his keen voice, and then all of
a sudden broke off. “Na, na,” said he, “I didnae mean that. What’s mine
is yours, Davie, my man, and what’s yours is mine. Blood’s thicker than
water; and there’s naebody but you and me that ought the name.” And
then on he rambled about the family, and its ancient greatness, and his
father that began to enlarge the house, and himself that stopped the
building as a sinful waste; and this put it in my head to give him
Jennet Clouston’s message.

“The limmer!” he cried. “Twelve hunner and fifteen--that’s every day
since I had the limmer rowpit!* Dod, David, I’ll have her roasted on red
peats before I’m by with it! A witch--a proclaimed witch! I’ll aff and
see the session clerk.”

     * Sold up.

And with that he opened a chest, and got out a very old and
well-preserved blue coat and waistcoat, and a good enough beaver hat,
both without lace. These he threw on any way, and taking a staff from
the cupboard, locked all up again, and was for setting out, when a
thought arrested him.

“I cannae leave you by yoursel’ in the house,” said he. “I’ll have to
lock you out.”

The blood came to my face. “If you lock me out,” I said, “it’ll be the
last you’ll see of me in friendship.”

He turned very pale, and sucked his mouth in.

“This is no the way,” he said, looking wickedly at a corner of the
floor--“this is no the way to win my favour, David.”

“Sir,” says I, “with a proper reverence for your age and our common
blood, I do not value your favour at a boddle’s purchase. I was brought
up to have a good conceit of myself; and if you were all the uncle, and
all the family, I had in the world ten times over, I wouldn’t buy your
liking at such prices.”

Uncle Ebenezer went and looked out of the window for awhile. I could
see him all trembling and twitching, like a man with palsy. But when he
turned round, he had a smile upon his face.

“Well, well,” said he, “we must bear and forbear. I’ll no go; that’s all
that’s to be said of it.”

“Uncle Ebenezer,” I said, “I can make nothing out of this. You use me
like a thief; you hate to have me in this house; you let me see it,
every word and every minute: it’s not possible that you can like me; and
as for me, I’ve spoken to you as I never thought to speak to any man.
Why do you seek to keep me, then? Let me gang back--let me gang back to
the friends I have, and that like me!”

“Na, na; na, na,” he said, very earnestly. “I like you fine; we’ll agree
fine yet; and for the honour of the house I couldnae let you leave the
way ye came. Bide here quiet, there’s a good lad; just you bide here
quiet a bittie, and ye’ll find that we agree.”

“Well, sir,” said I, after I had thought the matter out in silence,
“I’ll stay awhile. It’s more just I should be helped by my own blood
than strangers; and if we don’t agree, I’ll do my best it shall be
through no fault of mine.”




CHAPTER IV

I RUN A GREAT DANGER IN THE HOUSE OF SHAWS

For a day that was begun so ill, the day passed fairly well. We had the
porridge cold again at noon, and hot porridge at night; porridge and
small beer was my uncle’s diet. He spoke but little, and that in the
same way as before, shooting a question at me after a long silence; and
when I sought to lead him to talk about my future, slipped out of it
again. In a room next door to the kitchen, where he suffered me to go,
I found a great number of books, both Latin and English, in which I took
great pleasure all the afternoon. Indeed, the time passed so lightly in
this good company, that I began to be almost reconciled to my residence
at Shaws; and nothing but the sight of my uncle, and his eyes playing
hide and seek with mine, revived the force of my distrust.

One thing I discovered, which put me in some doubt. This was an entry on
the fly-leaf of a chap-book (one of Patrick Walker’s) plainly written
by my father’s hand and thus conceived: “To my brother Ebenezer on his
fifth birthday.” Now, what puzzled me was this: That, as my father was of
course the younger brother, he must either have made some strange error,
or he must have written, before he was yet five, an excellent, clear
manly hand of writing.

I tried to get this out of my head; but though I took down many
interesting authors, old and new, history, poetry, and story-book, this
notion of my father’s hand of writing stuck to me; and when at length I
went back into the kitchen, and sat down once more to porridge and small
beer, the first thing I said to Uncle Ebenezer was to ask him if my
father had not been very quick at his book.

“Alexander? No him!” was the reply. “I was far quicker mysel’; I was a
clever chappie when I was young. Why, I could read as soon as he could.”

This puzzled me yet more; and a thought coming into my head, I asked if
he and my father had been twins.

He jumped upon his stool, and the horn spoon fell out of his hand upon
the floor. “What gars ye ask that?” he said, and he caught me by the
breast of the jacket, and looked this time straight into my eyes:
his own were little and light, and bright like a bird’s, blinking and
winking strangely.

“What do you mean?” I asked, very calmly, for I was far stronger than
he, and not easily frightened. “Take your hand from my jacket. This is
no way to behave.”

My uncle seemed to make a great effort upon himself. “Dod man, David,”
 he said, “ye should-nae speak to me about your father. That’s where the
mistake is.” He sat awhile and shook, blinking in his plate: “He was all
the brother that ever I had,” he added, but with no heart in his voice;
and then he caught up his spoon and fell to supper again, but still
shaking.

Now this last passage, this laying of hands upon my person and
sudden profession of love for my dead father, went so clean beyond my
comprehension that it put me into both fear and hope. On the one hand,
I began to think my uncle was perhaps insane and might be dangerous;
on the other, there came up into my mind (quite unbidden by me and even
discouraged) a story like some ballad I had heard folk singing, of a
poor lad that was a rightful heir and a wicked kinsman that tried
to keep him from his own. For why should my uncle play a part with a
relative that came, almost a beggar, to his door, unless in his heart he
had some cause to fear him?

With this notion, all unacknowledged, but nevertheless getting firmly
settled in my head, I now began to imitate his covert looks; so that
we sat at table like a cat and a mouse, each stealthily observing the
other. Not another word had he to say to me, black or white, but was
busy turning something secretly over in his mind; and the longer we
sat and the more I looked at him, the more certain I became that the
something was unfriendly to myself.

When he had cleared the platter, he got out a single pipeful of tobacco,
just as in the morning, turned round a stool into the chimney corner,
and sat awhile smoking, with his back to me.

“Davie,” he said, at length, “I’ve been thinking;” then he paused, and
said it again. “There’s a wee bit siller that I half promised ye before
ye were born,” he continued; “promised it to your father. O, naething
legal, ye understand; just gentlemen daffing at their wine. Well, I
keepit that bit money separate--it was a great expense, but a promise
is a promise--and it has grown by now to be a matter of just
precisely--just exactly”--and here he paused and stumbled--“of just
exactly forty pounds!” This last he rapped out with a sidelong glance
over his shoulder; and the next moment added, almost with a scream,
“Scots!”

The pound Scots being the same thing as an English shilling, the
difference made by this second thought was considerable; I could see,
besides, that the whole story was a lie, invented with some end which
it puzzled me to guess; and I made no attempt to conceal the tone of
raillery in which I answered--

“O, think again, sir! Pounds sterling, I believe!”

“That’s what I said,” returned my uncle: “pounds sterling! And if you’ll
step out-by to the door a minute, just to see what kind of a night it
is, I’ll get it out to ye and call ye in again.”

I did his will, smiling to myself in my contempt that he should think I
was so easily to be deceived. It was a dark night, with a few stars low
down; and as I stood just outside the door, I heard a hollow moaning
of wind far off among the hills. I said to myself there was something
thundery and changeful in the weather, and little knew of what a vast
importance that should prove to me before the evening passed.

When I was called in again, my uncle counted out into my hand seven and
thirty golden guinea pieces; the rest was in his hand, in small gold and
silver; but his heart failed him there, and he crammed the change into
his pocket.

“There,” said he, “that’ll show you! I’m a queer man, and strange wi’
strangers; but my word is my bond, and there’s the proof of it.”

Now, my uncle seemed so miserly that I was struck dumb by this sudden
generosity, and could find no words in which to thank him.

“No a word!” said he. “Nae thanks; I want nae thanks. I do my duty. I’m
no saying that everybody would have done it; but for my part (though
I’m a careful body, too) it’s a pleasure to me to do the right by my
brother’s son; and it’s a pleasure to me to think that now we’ll agree
as such near friends should.”

I spoke him in return as handsomely as I was able; but all the while
I was wondering what would come next, and why he had parted with his
precious guineas; for as to the reason he had given, a baby would have
refused it.

Presently he looked towards me sideways.

“And see here,” says he, “tit for tat.”

I told him I was ready to prove my gratitude in any reasonable degree,
and then waited, looking for some monstrous demand. And yet, when
at last he plucked up courage to speak, it was only to tell me (very
properly, as I thought) that he was growing old and a little broken, and
that he would expect me to help him with the house and the bit garden.

I answered, and expressed my readiness to serve.

“Well,” he said, “let’s begin.” He pulled out of his pocket a rusty key.
“There,” says he, “there’s the key of the stair-tower at the far end of
the house. Ye can only win into it from the outside, for that part of
the house is no finished. Gang ye in there, and up the stairs, and bring
me down the chest that’s at the top. There’s papers in’t,” he added.

“Can I have a light, sir?” said I.

“Na,” said he, very cunningly. “Nae lights in my house.”

“Very well, sir,” said I. “Are the stairs good?”

“They’re grand,” said he; and then, as I was going, “Keep to the wall,”
 he added; “there’s nae bannisters. But the stairs are grand underfoot.”

Out I went into the night. The wind was still moaning in the distance,
though never a breath of it came near the house of Shaws. It had fallen
blacker than ever; and I was glad to feel along the wall, till I came
the length of the stairtower door at the far end of the unfinished wing.
I had got the key into the keyhole and had just turned it, when all upon
a sudden, without sound of wind or thunder, the whole sky lighted up
with wild fire and went black again. I had to put my hand over my eyes
to get back to the colour of the darkness; and indeed I was already half
blinded when I stepped into the tower.

It was so dark inside, it seemed a body could scarce breathe; but I
pushed out with foot and hand, and presently struck the wall with the
one, and the lowermost round of the stair with the other. The wall, by
the touch, was of fine hewn stone; the steps too, though somewhat steep
and narrow, were of polished masonwork, and regular and solid underfoot.
Minding my uncle’s word about the bannisters, I kept close to the tower
side, and felt my way in the pitch darkness with a beating heart.

The house of Shaws stood some five full storeys high, not counting
lofts. Well, as I advanced, it seemed to me the stair grew airier and a
thought more lightsome; and I was wondering what might be the cause of
this change, when a second blink of the summer lightning came and went.
If I did not cry out, it was because fear had me by the throat; and if I
did not fall, it was more by Heaven’s mercy than my own strength. It was
not only that the flash shone in on every side through breaches in the
wall, so that I seemed to be clambering aloft upon an open scaffold, but
the same passing brightness showed me the steps were of unequal length,
and that one of my feet rested that moment within two inches of the
well.

This was the grand stair! I thought; and with the thought, a gust of
a kind of angry courage came into my heart. My uncle had sent me here,
certainly to run great risks, perhaps to die. I swore I would settle
that “perhaps,” if I should break my neck for it; got me down upon my
hands and knees; and as slowly as a snail, feeling before me every
inch, and testing the solidity of every stone, I continued to ascend
the stair. The darkness, by contrast with the flash, appeared to have
redoubled; nor was that all, for my ears were now troubled and my mind
confounded by a great stir of bats in the top part of the tower, and the
foul beasts, flying downwards, sometimes beat about my face and body.

The tower, I should have said, was square; and in every corner the step
was made of a great stone of a different shape to join the flights.
Well, I had come close to one of these turns, when, feeling forward
as usual, my hand slipped upon an edge and found nothing but emptiness
beyond it. The stair had been carried no higher; to set a stranger
mounting it in the darkness was to send him straight to his death; and
(although, thanks to the lightning and my own precautions, I was safe
enough) the mere thought of the peril in which I might have stood, and
the dreadful height I might have fallen from, brought out the sweat upon
my body and relaxed my joints.

But I knew what I wanted now, and turned and groped my way down again,
with a wonderful anger in my heart. About half-way down, the wind sprang
up in a clap and shook the tower, and died again; the rain followed; and
before I had reached the ground level it fell in buckets. I put out my
head into the storm, and looked along towards the kitchen. The door,
which I had shut behind me when I left, now stood open, and shed a
little glimmer of light; and I thought I could see a figure standing
in the rain, quite still, like a man hearkening. And then there came
a blinding flash, which showed me my uncle plainly, just where I had
fancied him to stand; and hard upon the heels of it, a great tow-row of
thunder.

Now, whether my uncle thought the crash to be the sound of my fall, or
whether he heard in it God’s voice denouncing murder, I will leave you
to guess. Certain it is, at least, that he was seized on by a kind of
panic fear, and that he ran into the house and left the door open behind
him. I followed as softly as I could, and, coming unheard into the
kitchen, stood and watched him.

He had found time to open the corner cupboard and bring out a great case
bottle of aqua vitae, and now sat with his back towards me at the table.
Ever and again he would be seized with a fit of deadly shuddering and
groan aloud, and carrying the bottle to his lips, drink down the raw
spirits by the mouthful.

I stepped forward, came close behind him where he sat, and suddenly
clapping my two hands down upon his shoulders--“Ah!” cried I.

My uncle gave a kind of broken cry like a sheep’s bleat, flung up his
arms, and tumbled to the floor like a dead man. I was somewhat shocked
at this; but I had myself to look to first of all, and did not hesitate
to let him lie as he had fallen. The keys were hanging in the cupboard;
and it was my design to furnish myself with arms before my uncle should
come again to his senses and the power of devising evil. In the cupboard
were a few bottles, some apparently of medicine; a great many bills and
other papers, which I should willingly enough have rummaged, had I had
the time; and a few necessaries that were nothing to my purpose. Thence
I turned to the chests. The first was full of meal; the second of
moneybags and papers tied into sheaves; in the third, with many
other things (and these for the most part clothes) I found a rusty,
ugly-looking Highland dirk without the scabbard. This, then, I concealed
inside my waistcoat, and turned to my uncle.

He lay as he had fallen, all huddled, with one knee up and one arm
sprawling abroad; his face had a strange colour of blue, and he seemed
to have ceased breathing. Fear came on me that he was dead; then I
got water and dashed it in his face; and with that he seemed to come a
little to himself, working his mouth and fluttering his eyelids. At last
he looked up and saw me, and there came into his eyes a terror that was
not of this world.

“Come, come,” said I; “sit up.”

“Are ye alive?” he sobbed. “O man, are ye alive?”

“That am I,” said I. “Small thanks to you!”

He had begun to seek for his breath with deep sighs. “The blue phial,”
 said he--“in the aumry--the blue phial.” His breath came slower still.

I ran to the cupboard, and, sure enough, found there a blue phial
of medicine, with the dose written on it on a paper, and this I
administered to him with what speed I might.

“It’s the trouble,” said he, reviving a little; “I have a trouble,
Davie. It’s the heart.”

I set him on a chair and looked at him. It is true I felt some pity for
a man that looked so sick, but I was full besides of righteous anger;
and I numbered over before him the points on which I wanted explanation:
why he lied to me at every word; why he feared that I should leave him;
why he disliked it to be hinted that he and my father were twins--“Is
that because it is true?” I asked; why he had given me money to which I
was convinced I had no claim; and, last of all, why he had tried to kill
me. He heard me all through in silence; and then, in a broken voice,
begged me to let him go to bed.

“I’ll tell ye the morn,” he said; “as sure as death I will.”

And so weak was he that I could do nothing but consent. I locked him
into his room, however, and pocketed the key, and then returning to
the kitchen, made up such a blaze as had not shone there for many a long
year, and wrapping myself in my plaid, lay down upon the chests and fell
asleep.




CHAPTER V

I GO TO THE QUEEN’S FERRY

Much rain fell in the night; and the next morning there blew a bitter
wintry wind out of the north-west, driving scattered clouds. For all
that, and before the sun began to peep or the last of the stars had
vanished, I made my way to the side of the burn, and had a plunge in a
deep whirling pool. All aglow from my bath, I sat down once more
beside the fire, which I replenished, and began gravely to consider my
position.

There was now no doubt about my uncle’s enmity; there was no doubt I
carried my life in my hand, and he would leave no stone unturned that
he might compass my destruction. But I was young and spirited, and
like most lads that have been country-bred, I had a great opinion of my
shrewdness. I had come to his door no better than a beggar and little
more than a child; he had met me with treachery and violence; it would
be a fine consummation to take the upper hand, and drive him like a herd
of sheep.

I sat there nursing my knee and smiling at the fire; and I saw myself in
fancy smell out his secrets one after another, and grow to be that man’s
king and ruler. The warlock of Essendean, they say, had made a mirror in
which men could read the future; it must have been of other stuff than
burning coal; for in all the shapes and pictures that I sat and gazed
at, there was never a ship, never a seaman with a hairy cap, never a big
bludgeon for my silly head, or the least sign of all those tribulations
that were ripe to fall on me.

Presently, all swollen with conceit, I went up-stairs and gave my
prisoner his liberty. He gave me good-morning civilly; and I gave the
same to him, smiling down upon him, from the heights of my sufficiency.
Soon we were set to breakfast, as it might have been the day before.

“Well, sir,” said I, with a jeering tone, “have you nothing more to say
to me?” And then, as he made no articulate reply, “It will be time,
I think, to understand each other,” I continued. “You took me for
a country Johnnie Raw, with no more mother-wit or courage than a
porridge-stick. I took you for a good man, or no worse than others at
the least. It seems we were both wrong. What cause you have to fear me,
to cheat me, and to attempt my life--”

He murmured something about a jest, and that he liked a bit of fun; and
then, seeing me smile, changed his tone, and assured me he would make
all clear as soon as we had breakfasted. I saw by his face that he had
no lie ready for me, though he was hard at work preparing one; and I
think I was about to tell him so, when we were interrupted by a knocking
at the door.

Bidding my uncle sit where he was, I went to open it, and found on the
doorstep a half-grown boy in sea-clothes. He had no sooner seen me than
he began to dance some steps of the sea-hornpipe (which I had never
before heard of far less seen), snapping his fingers in the air and
footing it right cleverly. For all that, he was blue with the cold; and
there was something in his face, a look between tears and laughter, that
was highly pathetic and consisted ill with this gaiety of manner.

“What cheer, mate?” says he, with a cracked voice.

I asked him soberly to name his pleasure.

“O, pleasure!” says he; and then began to sing:

     “For it’s my delight, of a shiny night,
     In the season of the year.”

“Well,” said I, “if you have no business at all, I will even be so
unmannerly as to shut you out.”

“Stay, brother!” he cried. “Have you no fun about you? or do you want
to get me thrashed? I’ve brought a letter from old Heasyoasy to Mr.
Belflower.” He showed me a letter as he spoke. “And I say, mate,” he
added, “I’m mortal hungry.”

“Well,” said I, “come into the house, and you shall have a bite if I go
empty for it.”

With that I brought him in and set him down to my own place, where he
fell-to greedily on the remains of breakfast, winking to me between
whiles, and making many faces, which I think the poor soul considered
manly. Meanwhile, my uncle had read the letter and sat thinking; then,
suddenly, he got to his feet with a great air of liveliness, and pulled
me apart into the farthest corner of the room.

“Read that,” said he, and put the letter in my hand.

Here it is, lying before me as I write:

“The Hawes Inn, at the Queen’s Ferry.

“Sir,--I lie here with my hawser up and down, and send my cabin-boy to
informe. If you have any further commands for over-seas, to-day will be
the last occasion, as the wind will serve us well out of the firth.
I will not seek to deny that I have had crosses with your doer,* Mr.
Rankeillor; of which, if not speedily redd up, you may looke to see some
losses follow. I have drawn a bill upon you, as per margin, and am, sir,
     your most obedt., humble servant, “ELIAS HOSEASON.” * Agent.

“You see, Davie,” resumed my uncle, as soon as he saw that I had done,
“I have a venture with this man Hoseason, the captain of a trading brig,
the Covenant, of Dysart. Now, if you and me was to walk over with
yon lad, I could see the captain at the Hawes, or maybe on board the
Covenant if there was papers to be signed; and so far from a loss of
time, we can jog on to the lawyer, Mr. Rankeillor’s. After a’ that’s
come and gone, ye would be swier* to believe me upon my naked word; but
ye’ll believe Rankeillor. He’s factor to half the gentry in these parts;
an auld man, forby: highly respeckit, and he kenned your father.”

     * Unwilling.

I stood awhile and thought. I was going to some place of shipping, which
was doubtless populous, and where my uncle durst attempt no violence,
and, indeed, even the society of the cabin-boy so far protected me. Once
there, I believed I could force on the visit to the lawyer, even if my
uncle were now insincere in proposing it; and, perhaps, in the bottom
of my heart, I wished a nearer view of the sea and ships. You are to
remember I had lived all my life in the inland hills, and just two days
before had my first sight of the firth lying like a blue floor, and the
sailed ships moving on the face of it, no bigger than toys. One thing
with another, I made up my mind.

“Very well,” says I, “let us go to the Ferry.”

My uncle got into his hat and coat, and buckled an old rusty cutlass on;
and then we trod the fire out, locked the door, and set forth upon our
walk.

The wind, being in that cold quarter the north-west, blew nearly in our
faces as we went. It was the month of June; the grass was all white with
daisies, and the trees with blossom; but, to judge by our blue nails
and aching wrists, the time might have been winter and the whiteness a
December frost.

Uncle Ebenezer trudged in the ditch, jogging from side to side like an
old ploughman coming home from work. He never said a word the whole
way; and I was thrown for talk on the cabin-boy. He told me his name was
Ransome, and that he had followed the sea since he was nine, but could
not say how old he was, as he had lost his reckoning. He showed me
tattoo marks, baring his breast in the teeth of the wind and in spite
of my remonstrances, for I thought it was enough to kill him; he swore
horribly whenever he remembered, but more like a silly schoolboy than a
man; and boasted of many wild and bad things that he had done: stealthy
thefts, false accusations, ay, and even murder; but all with such a
dearth of likelihood in the details, and such a weak and crazy swagger
in the delivery, as disposed me rather to pity than to believe him.

I asked him of the brig (which he declared was the finest ship that
sailed) and of Captain Hoseason, in whose praises he was equally loud.
Heasyoasy (for so he still named the skipper) was a man, by his account,
that minded for nothing either in heaven or earth; one that, as people
said, would “crack on all sail into the day of judgment;” rough, fierce,
unscrupulous, and brutal; and all this my poor cabin-boy had taught
himself to admire as something seamanlike and manly. He would only admit
one flaw in his idol. “He ain’t no seaman,” he admitted. “That’s Mr.
Shuan that navigates the brig; he’s the finest seaman in the trade, only
for drink; and I tell you I believe it! Why, look’ere;” and turning down
his stocking he showed me a great, raw, red wound that made my blood run
cold. “He done that--Mr. Shuan done it,” he said, with an air of pride.

“What!” I cried, “do you take such savage usage at his hands? Why, you
are no slave, to be so handled!”

“No,” said the poor moon-calf, changing his tune at once, “and so he’ll
find. See’ere;” and he showed me a great case-knife, which he told me
was stolen. “O,” says he, “let me see him try; I dare him to; I’ll do
for him! O, he ain’t the first!” And he confirmed it with a poor, silly,
ugly oath.

I have never felt such pity for any one in this wide world as I felt for
that half-witted creature, and it began to come over me that the brig
Covenant (for all her pious name) was little better than a hell upon the
seas.

“Have you no friends?” said I.

He said he had a father in some English seaport, I forget which.

“He was a fine man, too,” he said, “but he’s dead.”

“In Heaven’s name,” cried I, “can you find no reputable life on shore?”

“O, no,” says he, winking and looking very sly, “they would put me to a
trade. I know a trick worth two of that, I do!”

I asked him what trade could be so dreadful as the one he followed,
where he ran the continual peril of his life, not alone from wind and
sea, but by the horrid cruelty of those who were his masters. He said
it was very true; and then began to praise the life, and tell what a
pleasure it was to get on shore with money in his pocket, and spend it
like a man, and buy apples, and swagger, and surprise what he called
stick-in-the-mud boys. “And then it’s not all as bad as that,” says he;
“there’s worse off than me: there’s the twenty-pounders. O, laws!
you should see them taking on. Why, I’ve seen a man as old as you, I
dessay”--(to him I seemed old)--“ah, and he had a beard, too--well, and
as soon as we cleared out of the river, and he had the drug out of his
head--my! how he cried and carried on! I made a fine fool of him, I tell
you! And then there’s little uns, too: oh, little by me! I tell you, I
keep them in order. When we carry little uns, I have a rope’s end of
my own to wollop’em.” And so he ran on, until it came in on me what
he meant by twenty-pounders were those unhappy criminals who were
sent over-seas to slavery in North America, or the still more unhappy
innocents who were kidnapped or trepanned (as the word went) for private
interest or vengeance.

Just then we came to the top of the hill, and looked down on the Ferry
and the Hope. The Firth of Forth (as is very well known) narrows at this
point to the width of a good-sized river, which makes a convenient ferry
going north, and turns the upper reach into a landlocked haven for all
manner of ships. Right in the midst of the narrows lies an islet with
some ruins; on the south shore they have built a pier for the service
of the Ferry; and at the end of the pier, on the other side of the road,
and backed against a pretty garden of holly-trees and hawthorns, I could
see the building which they called the Hawes Inn.

The town of Queensferry lies farther west, and the neighbourhood of the
inn looked pretty lonely at that time of day, for the boat had just gone
north with passengers. A skiff, however, lay beside the pier, with some
seamen sleeping on the thwarts; this, as Ransome told me, was the brig’s
boat waiting for the captain; and about half a mile off, and all
alone in the anchorage, he showed me the Covenant herself. There was a
sea-going bustle on board; yards were swinging into place; and as the
wind blew from that quarter, I could hear the song of the sailors as
they pulled upon the ropes. After all I had listened to upon the way, I
looked at that ship with an extreme abhorrence; and from the bottom of
my heart I pitied all poor souls that were condemned to sail in her.

We had all three pulled up on the brow of the hill; and now I marched
across the road and addressed my uncle. “I think it right to tell
you, sir,” says I, “there’s nothing that will bring me on board that
Covenant.”

He seemed to waken from a dream. “Eh?” he said. “What’s that?”

I told him over again.

“Well, well,” he said, “we’ll have to please ye, I suppose. But what
are we standing here for? It’s perishing cold; and if I’m no mistaken,
they’re busking the Covenant for sea.”




CHAPTER VI

WHAT BEFELL AT THE QUEEN’S FERRY

As soon as we came to the inn, Ransome led us up the stair to a small
room, with a bed in it, and heated like an oven by a great fire of coal.
At a table hard by the chimney, a tall, dark, sober-looking man sat
writing. In spite of the heat of the room, he wore a thick sea-jacket,
buttoned to the neck, and a tall hairy cap drawn down over his ears; yet
I never saw any man, not even a judge upon the bench, look cooler, or
more studious and self-possessed, than this ship-captain.

He got to his feet at once, and coming forward, offered his large hand
to Ebenezer. “I am proud to see you, Mr. Balfour,” said he, in a fine
deep voice, “and glad that ye are here in time. The wind’s fair, and the
tide upon the turn; we’ll see the old coal-bucket burning on the Isle of
May before to-night.”

“Captain Hoseason,” returned my uncle, “you keep your room unco hot.”

“It’s a habit I have, Mr. Balfour,” said the skipper. “I’m a cold-rife
man by my nature; I have a cold blood, sir. There’s neither fur,
nor flannel--no, sir, nor hot rum, will warm up what they call
the temperature. Sir, it’s the same with most men that have been
carbonadoed, as they call it, in the tropic seas.”

“Well, well, captain,” replied my uncle, “we must all be the way we’re
made.”

But it chanced that this fancy of the captain’s had a great share in my
misfortunes. For though I had promised myself not to let my kinsman out
of sight, I was both so impatient for a nearer look of the sea, and
so sickened by the closeness of the room, that when he told me to “run
down-stairs and play myself awhile,” I was fool enough to take him at
his word.

Away I went, therefore, leaving the two men sitting down to a bottle
and a great mass of papers; and crossing the road in front of the inn,
walked down upon the beach. With the wind in that quarter, only little
wavelets, not much bigger than I had seen upon a lake, beat upon the
shore. But the weeds were new to me--some green, some brown and long,
and some with little bladders that crackled between my fingers. Even so
far up the firth, the smell of the sea-water was exceedingly salt and
stirring; the Covenant, besides, was beginning to shake out her sails,
which hung upon the yards in clusters; and the spirit of all that I
beheld put me in thoughts of far voyages and foreign places.

I looked, too, at the seamen with the skiff--big brown fellows, some in
shirts, some with jackets, some with coloured handkerchiefs about their
throats, one with a brace of pistols stuck into his pockets, two or
three with knotty bludgeons, and all with their case-knives. I passed
the time of day with one that looked less desperate than his fellows,
and asked him of the sailing of the brig. He said they would get under
way as soon as the ebb set, and expressed his gladness to be out of
a port where there were no taverns and fiddlers; but all with such
horrifying oaths, that I made haste to get away from him.

This threw me back on Ransome, who seemed the least wicked of that gang,
and who soon came out of the inn and ran to me, crying for a bowl of
punch. I told him I would give him no such thing, for neither he nor I
was of an age for such indulgences. “But a glass of ale you may have,
and welcome,” said I. He mopped and mowed at me, and called me names;
but he was glad to get the ale, for all that; and presently we were
set down at a table in the front room of the inn, and both eating and
drinking with a good appetite.

Here it occurred to me that, as the landlord was a man of that county,
I might do well to make a friend of him. I offered him a share, as was
much the custom in those days; but he was far too great a man to sit
with such poor customers as Ransome and myself, and he was leaving the
room, when I called him back to ask if he knew Mr. Rankeillor.

“Hoot, ay,” says he, “and a very honest man. And, O, by-the-by,” says
he, “was it you that came in with Ebenezer?” And when I had told him
yes, “Ye’ll be no friend of his?” he asked, meaning, in the Scottish
way, that I would be no relative.

I told him no, none.

“I thought not,” said he, “and yet ye have a kind of gliff* of Mr.
Alexander.”

     * Look.

I said it seemed that Ebenezer was ill-seen in the country.

“Nae doubt,” said the landlord. “He’s a wicked auld man, and there’s
many would like to see him girning in the tow*. Jennet Clouston and mony
mair that he has harried out of house and hame. And yet he was ance
a fine young fellow, too. But that was before the sough** gaed abroad
about Mr. Alexander, that was like the death of him.”

     * Rope.

     ** Report.

“And what was it?” I asked.

“Ou, just that he had killed him,” said the landlord. “Did ye never hear
that?”

“And what would he kill him for?” said I.

“And what for, but just to get the place,” said he.

“The place?” said I. “The Shaws?”

“Nae other place that I ken,” said he.

“Ay, man?” said I. “Is that so? Was my--was Alexander the eldest son?”

“‘Deed was he,” said the landlord. “What else would he have killed him
for?”

And with that he went away, as he had been impatient to do from the
beginning.

Of course, I had guessed it a long while ago; but it is one thing to
guess, another to know; and I sat stunned with my good fortune, and
could scarce grow to believe that the same poor lad who had trudged in
the dust from Ettrick Forest not two days ago, was now one of the rich
of the earth, and had a house and broad lands, and might mount his horse
tomorrow. All these pleasant things, and a thousand others, crowded into
my mind, as I sat staring before me out of the inn window, and paying
no heed to what I saw; only I remember that my eye lighted on Captain
Hoseason down on the pier among his seamen, and speaking with some
authority. And presently he came marching back towards the house, with
no mark of a sailor’s clumsiness, but carrying his fine, tall figure
with a manly bearing, and still with the same sober, grave expression on
his face. I wondered if it was possible that Ransome’s stories could
be true, and half disbelieved them; they fitted so ill with the man’s
looks. But indeed, he was neither so good as I supposed him, nor quite
so bad as Ransome did; for, in fact, he was two men, and left the better
one behind as soon as he set foot on board his vessel.

The next thing, I heard my uncle calling me, and found the pair in the
road together. It was the captain who addressed me, and that with an air
(very flattering to a young lad) of grave equality.

“Sir,” said he, “Mr. Balfour tells me great things of you; and for my
own part, I like your looks. I wish I was for longer here, that we might
make the better friends; but we’ll make the most of what we have. Ye
shall come on board my brig for half an hour, till the ebb sets, and
drink a bowl with me.”

Now, I longed to see the inside of a ship more than words can tell; but
I was not going to put myself in jeopardy, and I told him my uncle and I
had an appointment with a lawyer.

“Ay, ay,” said he, “he passed me word of that. But, ye see, the boat’ll
set ye ashore at the town pier, and that’s but a penny stonecast from
Rankeillor’s house.” And here he suddenly leaned down and whispered in
my ear: “Take care of the old tod;* he means mischief. Come aboard till
I can get a word with ye.” And then, passing his arm through mine, he
continued aloud, as he set off towards his boat: “But, come, what can I
bring ye from the Carolinas? Any friend of Mr. Balfour’s can command.
A roll of tobacco? Indian feather-work? a skin of a wild beast? a stone
pipe? the mocking-bird that mews for all the world like a cat? the
cardinal bird that is as red as blood?--take your pick and say your
pleasure.”

     * Fox.

By this time we were at the boat-side, and he was handing me in. I did
not dream of hanging back; I thought (the poor fool!) that I had found
a good friend and helper, and I was rejoiced to see the ship. As soon as
we were all set in our places, the boat was thrust off from the pier
and began to move over the waters: and what with my pleasure in this new
movement and my surprise at our low position, and the appearance of the
shores, and the growing bigness of the brig as we drew near to it, I
could hardly understand what the captain said, and must have answered
him at random.

As soon as we were alongside (where I sat fairly gaping at the ship’s
height, the strong humming of the tide against its sides, and the
pleasant cries of the seamen at their work) Hoseason, declaring that he
and I must be the first aboard, ordered a tackle to be sent down from
the main-yard. In this I was whipped into the air and set down again on
the deck, where the captain stood ready waiting for me, and instantly
slipped back his arm under mine. There I stood some while, a little
dizzy with the unsteadiness of all around me, perhaps a little afraid,
and yet vastly pleased with these strange sights; the captain meanwhile
pointing out the strangest, and telling me their names and uses.

“But where is my uncle?” said I suddenly.

“Ay,” said Hoseason, with a sudden grimness, “that’s the point.”

I felt I was lost. With all my strength, I plucked myself clear of him
and ran to the bulwarks. Sure enough, there was the boat pulling for the
town, with my uncle sitting in the stern. I gave a piercing cry--“Help,
help! Murder!”--so that both sides of the anchorage rang with it, and
my uncle turned round where he was sitting, and showed me a face full of
cruelty and terror.

It was the last I saw. Already strong hands had been plucking me back
from the ship’s side; and now a thunderbolt seemed to strike me; I saw a
great flash of fire, and fell senseless.




CHAPTER VII

I GO TO SEA IN THE BRIG “COVENANT” OF DYSART

I came to myself in darkness, in great pain, bound hand and foot, and
deafened by many unfamiliar noises. There sounded in my ears a roaring
of water as of a huge mill-dam, the thrashing of heavy sprays, the
thundering of the sails, and the shrill cries of seamen. The whole world
now heaved giddily up, and now rushed giddily downward; and so sick and
hurt was I in body, and my mind so much confounded, that it took me a
long while, chasing my thoughts up and down, and ever stunned again by
a fresh stab of pain, to realise that I must be lying somewhere bound in
the belly of that unlucky ship, and that the wind must have strengthened
to a gale. With the clear perception of my plight, there fell upon me a
blackness of despair, a horror of remorse at my own folly, and a passion
of anger at my uncle, that once more bereft me of my senses.

When I returned again to life, the same uproar, the same confused and
violent movements, shook and deafened me; and presently, to my other
pains and distresses, there was added the sickness of an unused landsman
on the sea. In that time of my adventurous youth, I suffered many
hardships; but none that was so crushing to my mind and body, or lit by
so few hopes, as these first hours aboard the brig.

I heard a gun fire, and supposed the storm had proved too strong for us,
and we were firing signals of distress. The thought of deliverance, even
by death in the deep sea, was welcome to me. Yet it was no such matter;
but (as I was afterwards told) a common habit of the captain’s, which
I here set down to show that even the worst man may have his kindlier
side. We were then passing, it appeared, within some miles of Dysart,
where the brig was built, and where old Mrs. Hoseason, the captain’s
mother, had come some years before to live; and whether outward or
inward bound, the Covenant was never suffered to go by that place by
day, without a gun fired and colours shown.

I had no measure of time; day and night were alike in that ill-smelling
cavern of the ship’s bowels where I lay; and the misery of my situation
drew out the hours to double. How long, therefore, I lay waiting to hear
the ship split upon some rock, or to feel her reel head foremost into
the depths of the sea, I have not the means of computation. But sleep at
length stole from me the consciousness of sorrow.

I was awakened by the light of a hand-lantern shining in my face. A
small man of about thirty, with green eyes and a tangle of fair hair,
stood looking down at me.

“Well,” said he, “how goes it?”

I answered by a sob; and my visitor then felt my pulse and temples, and
set himself to wash and dress the wound upon my scalp.

“Ay,” said he, “a sore dunt*. What, man? Cheer up! The world’s no done;
you’ve made a bad start of it but you’ll make a better. Have you had any
meat?”

     * Stroke.

I said I could not look at it: and thereupon he gave me some brandy and
water in a tin pannikin, and left me once more to myself.

The next time he came to see me, I was lying betwixt sleep and waking,
my eyes wide open in the darkness, the sickness quite departed, but
succeeded by a horrid giddiness and swimming that was almost worse
to bear. I ached, besides, in every limb, and the cords that bound me
seemed to be of fire. The smell of the hole in which I lay seemed to
have become a part of me; and during the long interval since his last
visit I had suffered tortures of fear, now from the scurrying of the
ship’s rats, that sometimes pattered on my very face, and now from the
dismal imaginings that haunt the bed of fever.

The glimmer of the lantern, as a trap opened, shone in like the heaven’s
sunlight; and though it only showed me the strong, dark beams of the
ship that was my prison, I could have cried aloud for gladness. The man
with the green eyes was the first to descend the ladder, and I noticed
that he came somewhat unsteadily. He was followed by the captain.
Neither said a word; but the first set to and examined me, and dressed
my wound as before, while Hoseason looked me in my face with an odd,
black look.

“Now, sir, you see for yourself,” said the first: “a high fever, no
appetite, no light, no meat: you see for yourself what that means.”

“I am no conjurer, Mr. Riach,” said the captain.

“Give me leave, sir,” said Riach; “you’ve a good head upon your
shoulders, and a good Scotch tongue to ask with; but I will leave you no
manner of excuse; I want that boy taken out of this hole and put in the
forecastle.”

“What ye may want, sir, is a matter of concern to nobody but yoursel’,”
 returned the captain; “but I can tell ye that which is to be. Here he
is; here he shall bide.”

“Admitting that you have been paid in a proportion,” said the other, “I
will crave leave humbly to say that I have not. Paid I am, and none too
much, to be the second officer of this old tub, and you ken very well if
I do my best to earn it. But I was paid for nothing more.”

“If ye could hold back your hand from the tin-pan, Mr. Riach, I would
have no complaint to make of ye,” returned the skipper; “and instead
of asking riddles, I make bold to say that ye would keep your breath to
cool your porridge. We’ll be required on deck,” he added, in a sharper
note, and set one foot upon the ladder.

But Mr. Riach caught him by the sleeve.

“Admitting that you have been paid to do a murder----” he began.

Hoseason turned upon him with a flash.

“What’s that?” he cried. “What kind of talk is that?”

“It seems it is the talk that you can understand,” said Mr. Riach,
looking him steadily in the face.

“Mr. Riach, I have sailed with ye three cruises,” replied the captain.
“In all that time, sir, ye should have learned to know me: I’m a stiff
man, and a dour man; but for what ye say the now--fie, fie!--it comes
from a bad heart and a black conscience. If ye say the lad will die----”

“Ay, will he!” said Mr. Riach.

“Well, sir, is not that enough?” said Hoseason. “Flit him where ye
please!”

Thereupon the captain ascended the ladder; and I, who had lain silent
throughout this strange conversation, beheld Mr. Riach turn after him
and bow as low as to his knees in what was plainly a spirit of derision.
Even in my then state of sickness, I perceived two things: that the
mate was touched with liquor, as the captain hinted, and that (drunk or
sober) he was like to prove a valuable friend.

Five minutes afterwards my bonds were cut, I was hoisted on a man’s
back, carried up to the forecastle, and laid in a bunk on some
sea-blankets; where the first thing that I did was to lose my senses.

It was a blessed thing indeed to open my eyes again upon the daylight,
and to find myself in the society of men. The forecastle was a roomy
place enough, set all about with berths, in which the men of the watch
below were seated smoking, or lying down asleep. The day being calm and
the wind fair, the scuttle was open, and not only the good daylight, but
from time to time (as the ship rolled) a dusty beam of sunlight shone
in, and dazzled and delighted me. I had no sooner moved, moreover, than
one of the men brought me a drink of something healing which Mr. Riach
had prepared, and bade me lie still and I should soon be well again.
There were no bones broken, he explained: “A clour* on the head was
naething. Man,” said he, “it was me that gave it ye!”

     * Blow.

Here I lay for the space of many days a close prisoner, and not only got
my health again, but came to know my companions. They were a rough lot
indeed, as sailors mostly are: being men rooted out of all the kindly
parts of life, and condemned to toss together on the rough seas, with
masters no less cruel. There were some among them that had sailed with
the pirates and seen things it would be a shame even to speak of; some
were men that had run from the king’s ships, and went with a halter
round their necks, of which they made no secret; and all, as the saying
goes, were “at a word and a blow” with their best friends. Yet I had
not been many days shut up with them before I began to be ashamed of my
first judgment, when I had drawn away from them at the Ferry pier, as
though they had been unclean beasts. No class of man is altogether bad,
but each has its own faults and virtues; and these shipmates of mine
were no exception to the rule. Rough they were, sure enough; and bad, I
suppose; but they had many virtues. They were kind when it occurred to
them, simple even beyond the simplicity of a country lad like me, and
had some glimmerings of honesty.

There was one man, of maybe forty, that would sit on my berthside for
hours and tell me of his wife and child. He was a fisher that had lost
his boat, and thus been driven to the deep-sea voyaging. Well, it is
years ago now: but I have never forgotten him. His wife (who was “young
by him,” as he often told me) waited in vain to see her man return; he
would never again make the fire for her in the morning, nor yet keep
the bairn when she was sick. Indeed, many of these poor fellows (as the
event proved) were upon their last cruise; the deep seas and cannibal
fish received them; and it is a thankless business to speak ill of the
dead.

Among other good deeds that they did, they returned my money, which had
been shared among them; and though it was about a third short, I was
very glad to get it, and hoped great good from it in the land I was
going to. The ship was bound for the Carolinas; and you must not suppose
that I was going to that place merely as an exile. The trade was even
then much depressed; since that, and with the rebellion of the colonies
and the formation of the United States, it has, of course, come to
an end; but in those days of my youth, white men were still sold into
slavery on the plantations, and that was the destiny to which my wicked
uncle had condemned me.

The cabin-boy Ransome (from whom I had first heard of these atrocities)
came in at times from the round-house, where he berthed and served, now
nursing a bruised limb in silent agony, now raving against the cruelty
of Mr. Shuan. It made my heart bleed; but the men had a great respect
for the chief mate, who was, as they said, “the only seaman of the whole
jing-bang, and none such a bad man when he was sober.” Indeed, I found
there was a strange peculiarity about our two mates: that Mr. Riach was
sullen, unkind, and harsh when he was sober, and Mr. Shuan would not
hurt a fly except when he was drinking. I asked about the captain; but I
was told drink made no difference upon that man of iron.

I did my best in the small time allowed me to make some thing like a
man, or rather I should say something like a boy, of the poor creature,
Ransome. But his mind was scarce truly human. He could remember nothing
of the time before he came to sea; only that his father had made clocks,
and had a starling in the parlour, which could whistle “The North
Countrie;” all else had been blotted out in these years of hardship
and cruelties. He had a strange notion of the dry land, picked up from
sailor’s stories: that it was a place where lads were put to some kind
of slavery called a trade, and where apprentices were continually lashed
and clapped into foul prisons. In a town, he thought every second person
a decoy, and every third house a place in which seamen would be drugged
and murdered. To be sure, I would tell him how kindly I had myself been
used upon that dry land he was so much afraid of, and how well fed and
carefully taught both by my friends and my parents: and if he had been
recently hurt, he would weep bitterly and swear to run away; but if
he was in his usual crackbrain humour, or (still more) if he had had a
glass of spirits in the roundhouse, he would deride the notion.

It was Mr. Riach (Heaven forgive him!) who gave the boy drink; and
it was, doubtless, kindly meant; but besides that it was ruin to his
health, it was the pitifullest thing in life to see this unhappy,
unfriended creature staggering, and dancing, and talking he knew not
what. Some of the men laughed, but not all; others would grow as black
as thunder (thinking, perhaps, of their own childhood or their own
children) and bid him stop that nonsense, and think what he was doing.
As for me, I felt ashamed to look at him, and the poor child still comes
about me in my dreams.

All this time, you should know, the Covenant was meeting continual
head-winds and tumbling up and down against head-seas, so that the
scuttle was almost constantly shut, and the forecastle lighted only by a
swinging lantern on a beam. There was constant labour for all hands; the
sails had to be made and shortened every hour; the strain told on the
men’s temper; there was a growl of quarrelling all day long from berth
to berth; and as I was never allowed to set my foot on deck, you
can picture to yourselves how weary of my life I grew to be, and how
impatient for a change.

And a change I was to get, as you shall hear; but I must first tell of
a conversation I had with Mr. Riach, which put a little heart in me to
bear my troubles. Getting him in a favourable stage of drink (for indeed
he never looked near me when he was sober), I pledged him to secrecy,
and told him my whole story.

He declared it was like a ballad; that he would do his best to help
me; that I should have paper, pen, and ink, and write one line to Mr.
Campbell and another to Mr. Rankeillor; and that if I had told the
truth, ten to one he would be able (with their help) to pull me through
and set me in my rights.

“And in the meantime,” says he, “keep your heart up. You’re not the only
one, I’ll tell you that. There’s many a man hoeing tobacco over-seas
that should be mounting his horse at his own door at home; many and
many! And life is all a variorum, at the best. Look at me: I’m a laird’s
son and more than half a doctor, and here I am, man-Jack to Hoseason!”

I thought it would be civil to ask him for his story.

He whistled loud.

“Never had one,” said he. “I like fun, that’s all.” And he skipped out
of the forecastle.




CHAPTER VIII

THE ROUND-HOUSE

One night, about eleven o’clock, a man of Mr. Riach’s watch (which was
on deck) came below for his jacket; and instantly there began to go
a whisper about the forecastle that “Shuan had done for him at last.”
 There was no need of a name; we all knew who was meant; but we had
scarce time to get the idea rightly in our heads, far less to speak of
it, when the scuttle was again flung open, and Captain Hoseason came
down the ladder. He looked sharply round the bunks in the tossing light
of the lantern; and then, walking straight up to me, he addressed me, to
my surprise, in tones of kindness.

“My man,” said he, “we want ye to serve in the round-house. You and
Ransome are to change berths. Run away aft with ye.”

Even as he spoke, two seamen appeared in the scuttle, carrying Ransome
in their arms; and the ship at that moment giving a great sheer into the
sea, and the lantern swinging, the light fell direct on the boy’s face.
It was as white as wax, and had a look upon it like a dreadful smile.
The blood in me ran cold, and I drew in my breath as if I had been
struck.

“Run away aft; run away aft with ye!” cried Hoseason.

And at that I brushed by the sailors and the boy (who neither spoke nor
moved), and ran up the ladder on deck.

The brig was sheering swiftly and giddily through a long, cresting
swell. She was on the starboard tack, and on the left hand, under the
arched foot of the foresail, I could see the sunset still quite bright.
This, at such an hour of the night, surprised me greatly; but I was too
ignorant to draw the true conclusion--that we were going north-about
round Scotland, and were now on the high sea between the Orkney and
Shetland Islands, having avoided the dangerous currents of the Pentland
Firth. For my part, who had been so long shut in the dark and knew
nothing of head-winds, I thought we might be half-way or more across the
Atlantic. And indeed (beyond that I wondered a little at the lateness of
the sunset light) I gave no heed to it, and pushed on across the decks,
running between the seas, catching at ropes, and only saved from going
overboard by one of the hands on deck, who had been always kind to me.

The round-house, for which I was bound, and where I was now to sleep and
serve, stood some six feet above the decks, and considering the size of
the brig, was of good dimensions. Inside were a fixed table and bench,
and two berths, one for the captain and the other for the two mates,
turn and turn about. It was all fitted with lockers from top to bottom,
so as to stow away the officers’ belongings and a part of the ship’s
stores; there was a second store-room underneath, which you entered by a
hatchway in the middle of the deck; indeed, all the best of the meat and
drink and the whole of the powder were collected in this place; and all
the firearms, except the two pieces of brass ordnance, were set in a
rack in the aftermost wall of the round-house. The most of the cutlasses
were in another place.

A small window with a shutter on each side, and a skylight in the roof,
gave it light by day; and after dark there was a lamp always burning.
It was burning when I entered, not brightly, but enough to show Mr.
Shuan sitting at the table, with the brandy bottle and a tin pannikin
in front of him. He was a tall man, strongly made and very black; and he
stared before him on the table like one stupid.

He took no notice of my coming in; nor did he move when the captain
followed and leant on the berth beside me, looking darkly at the mate.
I stood in great fear of Hoseason, and had my reasons for it; but
something told me I need not be afraid of him just then; and I whispered
in his ear: “How is he?” He shook his head like one that does not know
and does not wish to think, and his face was very stern.

Presently Mr. Riach came in. He gave the captain a glance that meant the
boy was dead as plain as speaking, and took his place like the rest
of us; so that we all three stood without a word, staring down at Mr.
Shuan, and Mr. Shuan (on his side) sat without a word, looking hard upon
the table.

All of a sudden he put out his hand to take the bottle; and at that Mr.
Riach started forward and caught it away from him, rather by surprise
than violence, crying out, with an oath, that there had been too much of
this work altogether, and that a judgment would fall upon the ship.
And as he spoke (the weather sliding-doors standing open) he tossed the
bottle into the sea.

Mr. Shuan was on his feet in a trice; he still looked dazed, but he
meant murder, ay, and would have done it, for the second time that
night, had not the captain stepped in between him and his victim.

“Sit down!” roars the captain. “Ye sot and swine, do ye know what ye’ve
done? Ye’ve murdered the boy!”

Mr. Shuan seemed to understand; for he sat down again, and put up his
hand to his brow.

“Well,” he said, “he brought me a dirty pannikin!”

At that word, the captain and I and Mr. Riach all looked at each other
for a second with a kind of frightened look; and then Hoseason walked
up to his chief officer, took him by the shoulder, led him across to his
bunk, and bade him lie down and go to sleep, as you might speak to a bad
child. The murderer cried a little, but he took off his sea-boots and
obeyed.

“Ah!” cried Mr. Riach, with a dreadful voice, “ye should have interfered
long syne. It’s too late now.”

“Mr. Riach,” said the captain, “this night’s work must never be kennt
in Dysart. The boy went overboard, sir; that’s what the story is; and I
would give five pounds out of my pocket it was true!” He turned to the
table. “What made ye throw the good bottle away?” he added. “There was
nae sense in that, sir. Here, David, draw me another. They’re in the
bottom locker;” and he tossed me a key. “Ye’ll need a glass yourself,
sir,” he added to Riach. “Yon was an ugly thing to see.”

So the pair sat down and hob-a-nobbed; and while they did so, the
murderer, who had been lying and whimpering in his berth, raised himself
upon his elbow and looked at them and at me.

That was the first night of my new duties; and in the course of the next
day I had got well into the run of them. I had to serve at the meals,
which the captain took at regular hours, sitting down with the officer
who was off duty; all the day through I would be running with a dram
to one or other of my three masters; and at night I slept on a blanket
thrown on the deck boards at the aftermost end of the round-house, and
right in the draught of the two doors. It was a hard and a cold bed;
nor was I suffered to sleep without interruption; for some one would be
always coming in from deck to get a dram, and when a fresh watch was
to be set, two and sometimes all three would sit down and brew a bowl
together. How they kept their health, I know not, any more than how I
kept my own.

And yet in other ways it was an easy service. There was no cloth to lay;
the meals were either of oatmeal porridge or salt junk, except twice a
week, when there was duff: and though I was clumsy enough and (not being
firm on my sealegs) sometimes fell with what I was bringing them, both
Mr. Riach and the captain were singularly patient. I could not but fancy
they were making up lee-way with their consciences, and that they
would scarce have been so good with me if they had not been worse with
Ransome.

As for Mr. Shuan, the drink or his crime, or the two together, had
certainly troubled his mind. I cannot say I ever saw him in his proper
wits. He never grew used to my being there, stared at me continually
(sometimes, I could have thought, with terror), and more than once drew
back from my hand when I was serving him. I was pretty sure from the
first that he had no clear mind of what he had done, and on my second
day in the round-house I had the proof of it. We were alone, and he had
been staring at me a long time, when all at once, up he got, as pale as
death, and came close up to me, to my great terror. But I had no cause
to be afraid of him.

“You were not here before?” he asked.

“No, sir,” said I.”

“There was another boy?” he asked again; and when I had answered him,
“Ah!” says he, “I thought that,” and went and sat down, without another
word, except to call for brandy.

You may think it strange, but for all the horror I had, I was still
sorry for him. He was a married man, with a wife in Leith; but whether
or no he had a family, I have now forgotten; I hope not.

Altogether it was no very hard life for the time it lasted, which (as
you are to hear) was not long. I was as well fed as the best of them;
even their pickles, which were the great dainty, I was allowed my share
of; and had I liked I might have been drunk from morning to night, like
Mr. Shuan. I had company, too, and good company of its sort. Mr. Riach,
who had been to the college, spoke to me like a friend when he was not
sulking, and told me many curious things, and some that were informing;
and even the captain, though he kept me at the stick’s end the most part
of the time, would sometimes unbuckle a bit, and tell me of the fine
countries he had visited.

The shadow of poor Ransome, to be sure, lay on all four of us, and on
me and Mr. Shuan in particular, most heavily. And then I had another
trouble of my own. Here I was, doing dirty work for three men that I
looked down upon, and one of whom, at least, should have hung upon a
gallows; that was for the present; and as for the future, I could only
see myself slaving alongside of negroes in the tobacco fields. Mr.
Riach, perhaps from caution, would never suffer me to say another word
about my story; the captain, whom I tried to approach, rebuffed me like
a dog and would not hear a word; and as the days came and went, my heart
sank lower and lower, till I was even glad of the work which kept me
from thinking.




CHAPTER IX


THE MAN WITH THE BELT OF GOLD

More than a week went by, in which the ill-luck that had hitherto
pursued the Covenant upon this voyage grew yet more strongly marked.
Some days she made a little way; others, she was driven actually back.
At last we were beaten so far to the south that we tossed and tacked to
and fro the whole of the ninth day, within sight of Cape Wrath and the
wild, rocky coast on either hand of it. There followed on that a council
of the officers, and some decision which I did not rightly understand,
seeing only the result: that we had made a fair wind of a foul one and
were running south.

The tenth afternoon there was a falling swell and a thick, wet, white
fog that hid one end of the brig from the other. All afternoon, when
I went on deck, I saw men and officers listening hard over the
bulwarks--“for breakers,” they said; and though I did not so much as
understand the word, I felt danger in the air, and was excited.

Maybe about ten at night, I was serving Mr. Riach and the captain at
their supper, when the ship struck something with a great sound, and we
heard voices singing out. My two masters leaped to their feet.

“She’s struck!” said Mr. Riach.

“No, sir,” said the captain. “We’ve only run a boat down.”

And they hurried out.

The captain was in the right of it. We had run down a boat in the fog,
and she had parted in the midst and gone to the bottom with all her crew
but one. This man (as I heard afterwards) had been sitting in the stern
as a passenger, while the rest were on the benches rowing. At the moment
of the blow, the stern had been thrown into the air, and the man (having
his hands free, and for all he was encumbered with a frieze overcoat
that came below his knees) had leaped up and caught hold of the brig’s
bowsprit. It showed he had luck and much agility and unusual strength,
that he should have thus saved himself from such a pass. And yet, when
the captain brought him into the round-house, and I set eyes on him for
the first time, he looked as cool as I did.

He was smallish in stature, but well set and as nimble as a goat; his
face was of a good open expression, but sunburnt very dark, and heavily
freckled and pitted with the small-pox; his eyes were unusually light
and had a kind of dancing madness in them, that was both engaging and
alarming; and when he took off his great-coat, he laid a pair of fine
silver-mounted pistols on the table, and I saw that he was belted with
a great sword. His manners, besides, were elegant, and he pledged the
captain handsomely. Altogether I thought of him, at the first sight,
that here was a man I would rather call my friend than my enemy.

The captain, too, was taking his observations, but rather of the man’s
clothes than his person. And to be sure, as soon as he had taken off
the great-coat, he showed forth mighty fine for the round-house of a
merchant brig: having a hat with feathers, a red waistcoat, breeches
of black plush, and a blue coat with silver buttons and handsome silver
lace; costly clothes, though somewhat spoiled with the fog and being
slept in.

“I’m vexed, sir, about the boat,” says the captain.

“There are some pretty men gone to the bottom,” said the stranger, “that
I would rather see on the dry land again than half a score of boats.”

“Friends of yours?” said Hoseason.

“You have none such friends in your country,” was the reply. “They would
have died for me like dogs.”

“Well, sir,” said the captain, still watching him, “there are more men
in the world than boats to put them in.”

“And that’s true, too,” cried the other, “and ye seem to be a gentleman
of great penetration.”

“I have been in France, sir,” says the captain, so that it was plain he
meant more by the words than showed upon the face of them.

“Well, sir,” says the other, “and so has many a pretty man, for the
matter of that.”

“No doubt, sir,” says the captain, “and fine coats.”

“Oho!” says the stranger, “is that how the wind sets?” And he laid his
hand quickly on his pistols.

“Don’t be hasty,” said the captain. “Don’t do a mischief before ye
see the need of it. Ye’ve a French soldier’s coat upon your back and a
Scotch tongue in your head, to be sure; but so has many an honest fellow
in these days, and I dare say none the worse of it.”

“So?” said the gentleman in the fine coat: “are ye of the honest party?”
 (meaning, Was he a Jacobite? for each side, in these sort of civil
broils, takes the name of honesty for its own).

“Why, sir,” replied the captain, “I am a true-blue Protestant, and I
thank God for it.” (It was the first word of any religion I had ever
heard from him, but I learnt afterwards he was a great church-goer while
on shore.) “But, for all that,” says he, “I can be sorry to see another
man with his back to the wall.”

“Can ye so, indeed?” asked the Jacobite. “Well, sir, to be quite plain
with ye, I am one of those honest gentlemen that were in trouble about
the years forty-five and six; and (to be still quite plain with ye) if
I got into the hands of any of the red-coated gentry, it’s like it would
go hard with me. Now, sir, I was for France; and there was a French ship
cruising here to pick me up; but she gave us the go-by in the fog--as I
wish from the heart that ye had done yoursel’! And the best that I can
say is this: If ye can set me ashore where I was going, I have that upon
me will reward you highly for your trouble.”

“In France?” says the captain. “No, sir; that I cannot do. But where ye
come from--we might talk of that.”

And then, unhappily, he observed me standing in my corner, and packed
me off to the galley to get supper for the gentleman. I lost no time,
I promise you; and when I came back into the round-house, I found the
gentleman had taken a money-belt from about his waist, and poured out
a guinea or two upon the table. The captain was looking at the guineas,
and then at the belt, and then at the gentleman’s face; and I thought he
seemed excited.

“Half of it,” he cried, “and I’m your man!”

The other swept back the guineas into the belt, and put it on again
under his waistcoat. “I have told ye sir,” said he, “that not one doit
of it belongs to me. It belongs to my chieftain,” and here he touched
his hat, “and while I would be but a silly messenger to grudge some of
it that the rest might come safe, I should show myself a hound indeed if
I bought my own carcase any too dear. Thirty guineas on the sea-side, or
sixty if ye set me on the Linnhe Loch. Take it, if ye will; if not, ye
can do your worst.”

“Ay,” said Hoseason. “And if I give ye over to the soldiers?”

“Ye would make a fool’s bargain,” said the other. “My chief, let me tell
you, sir, is forfeited, like every honest man in Scotland. His estate
is in the hands of the man they call King George; and it is his officers
that collect the rents, or try to collect them. But for the honour of
Scotland, the poor tenant bodies take a thought upon their chief lying
in exile; and this money is a part of that very rent for which King
George is looking. Now, sir, ye seem to me to be a man that understands
things: bring this money within the reach of Government, and how much of
it’ll come to you?”

“Little enough, to be sure,” said Hoseason; and then, “if they knew,” he
added, drily. “But I think, if I was to try, that I could hold my tongue
about it.”

“Ah, but I’ll begowk* ye there!” cried the gentleman. “Play me false,
and I’ll play you cunning. If a hand is laid upon me, they shall ken
what money it is.”

     *Befool.

“Well,” returned the captain, “what must be must. Sixty guineas, and
done. Here’s my hand upon it.”

“And here’s mine,” said the other.

And thereupon the captain went out (rather hurriedly, I thought), and
left me alone in the round-house with the stranger.

At that period (so soon after the forty-five) there were many exiled
gentlemen coming back at the peril of their lives, either to see their
friends or to collect a little money; and as for the Highland chiefs
that had been forfeited, it was a common matter of talk how their
tenants would stint themselves to send them money, and their clansmen
outface the soldiery to get it in, and run the gauntlet of our great
navy to carry it across. All this I had, of course, heard tell of; and
now I had a man under my eyes whose life was forfeit on all these counts
and upon one more, for he was not only a rebel and a smuggler of rents,
but had taken service with King Louis of France. And as if all this
were not enough, he had a belt full of golden guineas round his loins.
Whatever my opinions, I could not look on such a man without a lively
interest.

“And so you’re a Jacobite?” said I, as I set meat before him.

“Ay,” said he, beginning to eat. “And you, by your long face, should be
a Whig?” *

     * Whig or Whigamore was the cant name for those who were
     loyal to King George.

“Betwixt and between,” said I, not to annoy him; for indeed I was as
good a Whig as Mr. Campbell could make me.

“And that’s naething,” said he. “But I’m saying, Mr.
Betwixt-and-Between,” he added, “this bottle of yours is dry; and it’s
hard if I’m to pay sixty guineas and be grudged a dram upon the back of
it.”

“I’ll go and ask for the key,” said I, and stepped on deck.

The fog was as close as ever, but the swell almost down. They had laid
the brig to, not knowing precisely where they were, and the wind (what
little there was of it) not serving well for their true course. Some of
the hands were still hearkening for breakers; but the captain and the
two officers were in the waist with their heads together. It struck me
(I don’t know why) that they were after no good; and the first word I
heard, as I drew softly near, more than confirmed me.

It was Mr. Riach, crying out as if upon a sudden thought: “Couldn’t we
wile him out of the round-house?”

“He’s better where he is,” returned Hoseason; “he hasn’t room to use his
sword.”

“Well, that’s true,” said Riach; “but he’s hard to come at.”

“Hut!” said Hoseason. “We can get the man in talk, one upon each side,
and pin him by the two arms; or if that’ll not hold, sir, we can make a
run by both the doors and get him under hand before he has the time to
draw.”

At this hearing, I was seized with both fear and anger at these
treacherous, greedy, bloody men that I sailed with. My first mind was to
run away; my second was bolder.

“Captain,” said I, “the gentleman is seeking a dram, and the bottle’s
out. Will you give me the key?”

They all started and turned about.

“Why, here’s our chance to get the firearms!”

Riach cried; and then to me: “Hark ye, David,” he said, “do ye ken where
the pistols are?”

“Ay, ay,” put in Hoseason. “David kens; David’s a good lad. Ye see,
David my man, yon wild Hielandman is a danger to the ship, besides being
a rank foe to King George, God bless him!”

I had never been so be-Davided since I came on board: but I said Yes, as
if all I heard were quite natural.

“The trouble is,” resumed the captain, “that all our firelocks, great
and little, are in the round-house under this man’s nose; likewise the
powder. Now, if I, or one of the officers, was to go in and take them,
he would fall to thinking. But a lad like you, David, might snap up a
horn and a pistol or two without remark. And if ye can do it cleverly,
I’ll bear it in mind when it’ll be good for you to have friends; and
that’s when we come to Carolina.”

Here Mr. Riach whispered him a little.

“Very right, sir,” said the captain; and then to myself: “And see here,
David, yon man has a beltful of gold, and I give you my word that you
shall have your fingers in it.”

I told him I would do as he wished, though indeed I had scarce breath to
speak with; and upon that he gave me the key of the spirit locker, and I
began to go slowly back to the round-house. What was I to do? They
were dogs and thieves; they had stolen me from my own country; they had
killed poor Ransome; and was I to hold the candle to another murder? But
then, upon the other hand, there was the fear of death very plain before
me; for what could a boy and a man, if they were as brave as lions,
against a whole ship’s company?

I was still arguing it back and forth, and getting no great clearness,
when I came into the round-house and saw the Jacobite eating his supper
under the lamp; and at that my mind was made up all in a moment. I have
no credit by it; it was by no choice of mine, but as if by compulsion,
that I walked right up to the table and put my hand on his shoulder.

“Do ye want to be killed?” said I. He sprang to his feet, and looked a
question at me as clear as if he had spoken.

“O!” cried I, “they’re all murderers here; it’s a ship full of them!
They’ve murdered a boy already. Now it’s you.”

“Ay, ay,” said he; “but they have n’t got me yet.” And then looking at me
curiously, “Will ye stand with me?”

“That will I!” said I. “I am no thief, nor yet murderer. I’ll stand by
you.”

“Why, then,” said he, “what’s your name?”

“David Balfour,” said I; and then, thinking that a man with so fine a
coat must like fine people, I added for the first time, “of Shaws.”

It never occurred to him to doubt me, for a Highlander is used to see
great gentlefolk in great poverty; but as he had no estate of his own,
my words nettled a very childish vanity he had.

“My name is Stewart,” he said, drawing himself up. “Alan Breck, they
call me. A king’s name is good enough for me, though I bear it plain and
have the name of no farm-midden to clap to the hind-end of it.”

And having administered this rebuke, as though it were something of a
chief importance, he turned to examine our defences.

The round-house was built very strong, to support the breaching of the
seas. Of its five apertures, only the skylight and the two doors were
large enough for the passage of a man. The doors, besides, could be
drawn close: they were of stout oak, and ran in grooves, and were fitted
with hooks to keep them either shut or open, as the need arose. The
one that was already shut I secured in this fashion; but when I was
proceeding to slide to the other, Alan stopped me.

“David,” said he--“for I cannae bring to mind the name of your landed
estate, and so will make so bold as to call you David--that door, being
open, is the best part of my defences.”

“It would be yet better shut,” says I.

“Not so, David,” says he. “Ye see, I have but one face; but so long as
that door is open and my face to it, the best part of my enemies will be
in front of me, where I would aye wish to find them.”

Then he gave me from the rack a cutlass (of which there were a few
besides the firearms), choosing it with great care, shaking his head and
saying he had never in all his life seen poorer weapons; and next he set
me down to the table with a powder-horn, a bag of bullets and all the
pistols, which he bade me charge.

“And that will be better work, let me tell you,” said he, “for a
gentleman of decent birth, than scraping plates and raxing* drams to a
wheen tarry sailors.”

     *Reaching.

Thereupon he stood up in the midst with his face to the door, and
drawing his great sword, made trial of the room he had to wield it in.

“I must stick to the point,” he said, shaking his head; “and that’s a
pity, too. It doesn’t set my genius, which is all for the upper guard.
And, now,” said he, “do you keep on charging the pistols, and give heed
to me.”

I told him I would listen closely. My chest was tight, my mouth dry, the
light dark to my eyes; the thought of the numbers that were soon to
leap in upon us kept my heart in a flutter: and the sea, which I heard
washing round the brig, and where I thought my dead body would be cast
ere morning, ran in my mind strangely.

“First of all,” said he, “how many are against us?”

I reckoned them up; and such was the hurry of my mind, I had to cast the
numbers twice. “Fifteen,” said I.

Alan whistled. “Well,” said he, “that can’t be cured. And now follow me.
It is my part to keep this door, where I look for the main battle. In
that, ye have no hand. And mind and dinnae fire to this side unless they
get me down; for I would rather have ten foes in front of me than one
friend like you cracking pistols at my back.”

I told him, indeed I was no great shot.

“And that’s very bravely said,” he cried, in a great admiration of my
candour. “There’s many a pretty gentleman that wouldnae dare to say it.”

“But then, sir,” said I, “there is the door behind you, which they may
perhaps break in.”

“Ay,” said he, “and that is a part of your work. No sooner the pistols
charged, than ye must climb up into yon bed where ye’re handy at the
window; and if they lift hand against the door, ye’re to shoot. But
that’s not all. Let’s make a bit of a soldier of ye, David. What else
have ye to guard?”

“There’s the skylight,” said I. “But indeed, Mr. Stewart, I would need
to have eyes upon both sides to keep the two of them; for when my face
is at the one, my back is to the other.”

“And that’s very true,” said Alan. “But have ye no ears to your head?”

“To be sure!” cried I. “I must hear the bursting of the glass!”

“Ye have some rudiments of sense,” said Alan, grimly.




CHAPTER X

THE SIEGE OF THE ROUND-HOUSE

But now our time of truce was come to an end. Those on deck had waited
for my coming till they grew impatient; and scarce had Alan spoken, when
the captain showed face in the open door.

“Stand!” cried Alan, and pointed his sword at him. The captain stood,
indeed; but he neither winced nor drew back a foot.

“A naked sword?” says he. “This is a strange return for hospitality.”

“Do ye see me?” said Alan. “I am come of kings; I bear a king’s name. My
badge is the oak. Do ye see my sword? It has slashed the heads off mair
Whigamores than you have toes upon your feet. Call up your vermin to
your back, sir, and fall on! The sooner the clash begins, the sooner
ye’ll taste this steel throughout your vitals.”

The captain said nothing to Alan, but he looked over at me with an ugly
look. “David,” said he, “I’ll mind this;” and the sound of his voice
went through me with a jar.

Next moment he was gone.

“And now,” said Alan, “let your hand keep your head, for the grip is
coming.”

Alan drew a dirk, which he held in his left hand in case they should run
in under his sword. I, on my part, clambered up into the berth with
an armful of pistols and something of a heavy heart, and set open the
window where I was to watch. It was a small part of the deck that I
could overlook, but enough for our purpose. The sea had gone down, and
the wind was steady and kept the sails quiet; so that there was a
great stillness in the ship, in which I made sure I heard the sound of
muttering voices. A little after, and there came a clash of steel upon
the deck, by which I knew they were dealing out the cutlasses and one
had been let fall; and after that, silence again.

I do not know if I was what you call afraid; but my heart beat like a
bird’s, both quick and little; and there was a dimness came before my
eyes which I continually rubbed away, and which continually returned. As
for hope, I had none; but only a darkness of despair and a sort of anger
against all the world that made me long to sell my life as dear as I was
able. I tried to pray, I remember, but that same hurry of my mind, like
a man running, would not suffer me to think upon the words; and my chief
wish was to have the thing begin and be done with it.

It came all of a sudden when it did, with a rush of feet and a roar, and
then a shout from Alan, and a sound of blows and some one crying out
as if hurt. I looked back over my shoulder, and saw Mr. Shuan in the
doorway, crossing blades with Alan.

“That’s him that killed the boy!” I cried.

“Look to your window!” said Alan; and as I turned back to my place, I
saw him pass his sword through the mate’s body.

It was none too soon for me to look to my own part; for my head was
scarce back at the window, before five men, carrying a spare yard for
a battering-ram, ran past me and took post to drive the door in. I had
never fired with a pistol in my life, and not often with a gun; far less
against a fellow-creature. But it was now or never; and just as they
swang the yard, I cried out: “Take that!” and shot into their midst.

I must have hit one of them, for he sang out and gave back a step, and
the rest stopped as if a little disconcerted. Before they had time to
recover, I sent another ball over their heads; and at my third shot
(which went as wide as the second) the whole party threw down the yard
and ran for it.

Then I looked round again into the deck-house. The whole place was full
of the smoke of my own firing, just as my ears seemed to be burst with
the noise of the shots. But there was Alan, standing as before; only
now his sword was running blood to the hilt, and himself so swelled
with triumph and fallen into so fine an attitude, that he looked to be
invincible. Right before him on the floor was Mr. Shuan, on his hands
and knees; the blood was pouring from his mouth, and he was sinking
slowly lower, with a terrible, white face; and just as I looked, some of
those from behind caught hold of him by the heels and dragged him bodily
out of the round-house. I believe he died as they were doing it.

“There’s one of your Whigs for ye!” cried Alan; and then turning to me,
he asked if I had done much execution.

I told him I had winged one, and thought it was the captain.

“And I’ve settled two,” says he. “No, there’s not enough blood let;
they’ll be back again. To your watch, David. This was but a dram before
meat.”

I settled back to my place, re-charging the three pistols I had fired,
and keeping watch with both eye and ear.

Our enemies were disputing not far off upon the deck, and that so loudly
that I could hear a word or two above the washing of the seas.

“It was Shuan bauchled* it,” I heard one say.

     * Bungled.

And another answered him with a “Wheesht, man! He’s paid the piper.”

After that the voices fell again into the same muttering as before. Only
now, one person spoke most of the time, as though laying down a plan,
and first one and then another answered him briefly, like men taking
orders. By this, I made sure they were coming on again, and told Alan.

“It’s what we have to pray for,” said he. “Unless we can give them a
good distaste of us, and done with it, there’ll be nae sleep for either
you or me. But this time, mind, they’ll be in earnest.”

By this, my pistols were ready, and there was nothing to do but listen
and wait. While the brush lasted, I had not the time to think if I was
frighted; but now, when all was still again, my mind ran upon nothing
else. The thought of the sharp swords and the cold steel was strong in
me; and presently, when I began to hear stealthy steps and a brushing
of men’s clothes against the round-house wall, and knew they were taking
their places in the dark, I could have found it in my mind to cry out
aloud.

All this was upon Alan’s side; and I had begun to think my share of the
fight was at an end, when I heard some one drop softly on the roof above
me.

Then there came a single call on the sea-pipe, and that was the signal.
A knot of them made one rush of it, cutlass in hand, against the door;
and at the same moment, the glass of the skylight was dashed in a
thousand pieces, and a man leaped through and landed on the floor.
Before he got his feet, I had clapped a pistol to his back, and might
have shot him, too; only at the touch of him (and him alive) my whole
flesh misgave me, and I could no more pull the trigger than I could have
flown.

He had dropped his cutlass as he jumped, and when he felt the pistol,
whipped straight round and laid hold of me, roaring out an oath; and at
that either my courage came again, or I grew so much afraid as came to
the same thing; for I gave a shriek and shot him in the midst of the
body. He gave the most horrible, ugly groan and fell to the floor. The
foot of a second fellow, whose legs were dangling through the skylight,
struck me at the same time upon the head; and at that I snatched another
pistol and shot this one through the thigh, so that he slipped through
and tumbled in a lump on his companion’s body. There was no talk of
missing, any more than there was time to aim; I clapped the muzzle to
the very place and fired.

I might have stood and stared at them for long, but I heard Alan shout
as if for help, and that brought me to my senses.

He had kept the door so long; but one of the seamen, while he was
engaged with others, had run in under his guard and caught him about the
body. Alan was dirking him with his left hand, but the fellow clung like
a leech. Another had broken in and had his cutlass raised. The door was
thronged with their faces. I thought we were lost, and catching up my
cutlass, fell on them in flank.

But I had not time to be of help. The wrestler dropped at last; and
Alan, leaping back to get his distance, ran upon the others like a
bull, roaring as he went. They broke before him like water, turning, and
running, and falling one against another in their haste. The sword
in his hands flashed like quicksilver into the huddle of our fleeing
enemies; and at every flash there came the scream of a man hurt. I was
still thinking we were lost, when lo! they were all gone, and Alan was
driving them along the deck as a sheep-dog chases sheep.

Yet he was no sooner out than he was back again, being as cautious as he
was brave; and meanwhile the seamen continued running and crying out as
if he was still behind them; and we heard them tumble one upon another
into the forecastle, and clap-to the hatch upon the top.

The round-house was like a shambles; three were dead inside, another
lay in his death agony across the threshold; and there were Alan and I
victorious and unhurt.

He came up to me with open arms. “Come to my arms!” he cried, and
embraced and kissed me hard upon both cheeks. “David,” said he, “I love
you like a brother. And O, man,” he cried in a kind of ecstasy, “am I no
a bonny fighter?”

Thereupon he turned to the four enemies, passed his sword clean through
each of them, and tumbled them out of doors one after the other. As he
did so, he kept humming and singing and whistling to himself, like a man
trying to recall an air; only what HE was trying was to make one. All
the while, the flush was in his face, and his eyes were as bright as a
five-year-old child’s with a new toy. And presently he sat down upon the
table, sword in hand; the air that he was making all the time began to
run a little clearer, and then clearer still; and then out he burst with
a great voice into a Gaelic song.

I have translated it here, not in verse (of which I have no skill) but
at least in the king’s English.

He sang it often afterwards, and the thing became popular; so that I
have heard it and had it explained to me, many’s the time.


“This is the song of the sword of Alan; The smith made it, The fire set
it; Now it shines in the hand of Alan Breck.

“Their eyes were many and bright, Swift were they to behold, Many the
hands they guided: The sword was alone.

“The dun deer troop over the hill, They are many, the hill is one; The
dun deer vanish, The hill remains.

“Come to me from the hills of heather, Come from the isles of the sea. O
far-beholding eagles, Here is your meat.”


Now this song which he made (both words and music) in the hour of our
victory, is something less than just to me, who stood beside him in
the tussle. Mr. Shuan and five more were either killed outright or
thoroughly disabled; but of these, two fell by my hand, the two that
came by the skylight. Four more were hurt, and of that number, one (and
he not the least important) got his hurt from me. So that, altogether,
I did my fair share both of the killing and the wounding, and might have
claimed a place in Alan’s verses. But poets have to think upon their
rhymes; and in good prose talk, Alan always did me more than justice.

In the meanwhile, I was innocent of any wrong being done me. For not
only I knew no word of the Gaelic; but what with the long suspense of
the waiting, and the scurry and strain of our two spirts of fighting,
and more than all, the horror I had of some of my own share in it, the
thing was no sooner over than I was glad to stagger to a seat. There was
that tightness on my chest that I could hardly breathe; the thought
of the two men I had shot sat upon me like a nightmare; and all upon a
sudden, and before I had a guess of what was coming, I began to sob and
cry like any child.

Alan clapped my shoulder, and said I was a brave lad and wanted nothing
but a sleep.

“I’ll take the first watch,” said he. “Ye’ve done well by me, David,
first and last; and I wouldn’t lose you for all Appin--no, nor for
Breadalbane.”

So I made up my bed on the floor; and he took the first spell, pistol
in hand and sword on knee, three hours by the captain’s watch upon the
wall. Then he roused me up, and I took my turn of three hours; before
the end of which it was broad day, and a very quiet morning, with a
smooth, rolling sea that tossed the ship and made the blood run to and
fro on the round-house floor, and a heavy rain that drummed upon the
roof. All my watch there was nothing stirring; and by the banging of the
helm, I knew they had even no one at the tiller. Indeed (as I learned
afterwards) there were so many of them hurt or dead, and the rest in so
ill a temper, that Mr. Riach and the captain had to take turn and turn
like Alan and me, or the brig might have gone ashore and nobody the
wiser. It was a mercy the night had fallen so still, for the wind had
gone down as soon as the rain began. Even as it was, I judged by the
wailing of a great number of gulls that went crying and fishing round
the ship, that she must have drifted pretty near the coast or one of
the islands of the Hebrides; and at last, looking out of the door of the
round-house, I saw the great stone hills of Skye on the right hand, and,
a little more astern, the strange isle of Rum.




CHAPTER XI

THE CAPTAIN KNUCKLES UNDER

Alan and I sat down to breakfast about six of the clock. The floor was
covered with broken glass and in a horrid mess of blood, which took away
my hunger. In all other ways we were in a situation not only agreeable
but merry; having ousted the officers from their own cabin, and having
at command all the drink in the ship--both wine and spirits--and all the
dainty part of what was eatable, such as the pickles and the fine sort
of bread. This, of itself, was enough to set us in good humour, but the
richest part of it was this, that the two thirstiest men that ever came
out of Scotland (Mr. Shuan being dead) were now shut in the fore-part of
the ship and condemned to what they hated most--cold water.

“And depend upon it,” Alan said, “we shall hear more of them ere long.
Ye may keep a man from the fighting, but never from his bottle.”

We made good company for each other. Alan, indeed, expressed himself
most lovingly; and taking a knife from the table, cut me off one of the
silver buttons from his coat.

“I had them,” says he, “from my father, Duncan Stewart; and now give ye
one of them to be a keepsake for last night’s work. And wherever ye go
and show that button, the friends of Alan Breck will come around you.”

He said this as if he had been Charlemagne, and commanded armies; and
indeed, much as I admired his courage, I was always in danger of smiling
at his vanity: in danger, I say, for had I not kept my countenance, I
would be afraid to think what a quarrel might have followed.

As soon as we were through with our meal he rummaged in the captain’s
locker till he found a clothes-brush; and then taking off his coat,
began to visit his suit and brush away the stains, with such care and
labour as I supposed to have been only usual with women. To be sure, he
had no other; and, besides (as he said), it belonged to a king and so
behoved to be royally looked after.

For all that, when I saw what care he took to pluck out the threads
where the button had been cut away, I put a higher value on his gift.

He was still so engaged when we were hailed by Mr. Riach from the deck,
asking for a parley; and I, climbing through the skylight and sitting on
the edge of it, pistol in hand and with a bold front, though inwardly in
fear of broken glass, hailed him back again and bade him speak out. He
came to the edge of the round-house, and stood on a coil of rope, so
that his chin was on a level with the roof; and we looked at each other
awhile in silence. Mr. Riach, as I do not think he had been very forward
in the battle, so he had got off with nothing worse than a blow upon the
cheek: but he looked out of heart and very weary, having been all night
afoot, either standing watch or doctoring the wounded.

“This is a bad job,” said he at last, shaking his head.

“It was none of our choosing,” said I.

“The captain,” says he, “would like to speak with your friend. They
might speak at the window.”

“And how do we know what treachery he means?” cried I.

“He means none, David,” returned Mr. Riach, “and if he did, I’ll tell ye
the honest truth, we couldnae get the men to follow.”

“Is that so?” said I.

“I’ll tell ye more than that,” said he. “It’s not only the men; it’s me.
I’m frich’ened, Davie.” And he smiled across at me. “No,” he continued,
“what we want is to be shut of him.”

Thereupon I consulted with Alan, and the parley was agreed to and
parole given upon either side; but this was not the whole of Mr. Riach’s
business, and he now begged me for a dram with such instancy and such
reminders of his former kindness, that at last I handed him a pannikin
with about a gill of brandy. He drank a part, and then carried the rest
down upon the deck, to share it (I suppose) with his superior.

A little after, the captain came (as was agreed) to one of the windows,
and stood there in the rain, with his arm in a sling, and looking stern
and pale, and so old that my heart smote me for having fired upon him.

Alan at once held a pistol in his face.

“Put that thing up!” said the captain. “Have I not passed my word, sir?
or do ye seek to affront me?”

“Captain,” says Alan, “I doubt your word is a breakable. Last night ye
haggled and argle-bargled like an apple-wife; and then passed me your
word, and gave me your hand to back it; and ye ken very well what was
the upshot. Be damned to your word!” says he.

“Well, well, sir,” said the captain, “ye’ll get little good by
swearing.” (And truly that was a fault of which the captain was quite
free.) “But we have other things to speak,” he continued, bitterly.
“Ye’ve made a sore hash of my brig; I haven’t hands enough left to work
her; and my first officer (whom I could ill spare) has got your sword
throughout his vitals, and passed without speech. There is nothing left
me, sir, but to put back into the port of Glasgow after hands; and there
(by your leave) ye will find them that are better able to talk to you.”

“Ay?” said Alan; “and faith, I’ll have a talk with them mysel’! Unless
there’s naebody speaks English in that town, I have a bonny tale for
them. Fifteen tarry sailors upon the one side, and a man and a halfling
boy upon the other! O, man, it’s peetiful!”

Hoseason flushed red.

“No,” continued Alan, “that’ll no do. Ye’ll just have to set me ashore
as we agreed.”

“Ay,” said Hoseason, “but my first officer is dead--ye ken best how.
There’s none of the rest of us acquaint with this coast, sir; and it’s
one very dangerous to ships.”

“I give ye your choice,” says Alan. “Set me on dry ground in Appin,
or Ardgour, or in Morven, or Arisaig, or Morar; or, in brief, where ye
please, within thirty miles of my own country; except in a country of
the Campbells. That’s a broad target. If ye miss that, ye must be as
feckless at the sailoring as I have found ye at the fighting. Why, my
poor country people in their bit cobles* pass from island to island in
all weathers, ay, and by night too, for the matter of that.”

     *Coble: a small boat used in fishing.

“A coble’s not a ship, sir,” said the captain. “It has nae draught of
water.”

“Well, then, to Glasgow if ye list!” says Alan. “We’ll have the laugh of
ye at the least.”

“My mind runs little upon laughing,” said the captain. “But all this
will cost money, sir.”

“Well, sir,” says Alan, “I am nae weathercock. Thirty guineas, if ye land
me on the sea-side; and sixty, if ye put me in the Linnhe Loch.”

“But see, sir, where we lie, we are but a few hours’ sail from
Ardnamurchan,” said Hoseason. “Give me sixty, and I’ll set ye there.”

“And I’m to wear my brogues and run jeopardy of the red-coats to please
you?” cries Alan. “No, sir; if ye want sixty guineas earn them, and set
me in my own country.”

“It’s to risk the brig, sir,” said the captain, “and your own lives
along with her.”

“Take it or want it,” says Alan.

“Could ye pilot us at all?” asked the captain, who was frowning to
himself.

“Well, it’s doubtful,” said Alan. “I’m more of a fighting man (as ye
have seen for yoursel’) than a sailor-man. But I have been often enough
picked up and set down upon this coast, and should ken something of the
lie of it.”

The captain shook his head, still frowning.

“If I had lost less money on this unchancy cruise,” says he, “I would
see you in a rope’s end before I risked my brig, sir. But be it as ye
will. As soon as I get a slant of wind (and there’s some coming, or I’m
the more mistaken) I’ll put it in hand. But there’s one thing more. We
may meet in with a king’s ship and she may lay us aboard, sir, with no
blame of mine: they keep the cruisers thick upon this coast, ye ken who
for. Now, sir, if that was to befall, ye might leave the money.”

“Captain,” says Alan, “if ye see a pennant, it shall be your part to
run away. And now, as I hear you’re a little short of brandy in the
fore-part, I’ll offer ye a change: a bottle of brandy against two
buckets of water.”

That was the last clause of the treaty, and was duly executed on both
sides; so that Alan and I could at last wash out the round-house and be
quit of the memorials of those whom we had slain, and the captain and
Mr. Riach could be happy again in their own way, the name of which was
drink.




CHAPTER XII

I HEAR OF THE “RED FOX”

Before we had done cleaning out the round-house, a breeze sprang up from
a little to the east of north. This blew off the rain and brought out
the sun.

And here I must explain; and the reader would do well to look at a map.
On the day when the fog fell and we ran down Alan’s boat, we had been
running through the Little Minch. At dawn after the battle, we lay
becalmed to the east of the Isle of Canna or between that and Isle
Eriska in the chain of the Long Island. Now to get from there to the
Linnhe Loch, the straight course was through the narrows of the Sound of
Mull. But the captain had no chart; he was afraid to trust his brig so
deep among the islands; and the wind serving well, he preferred to go by
west of Tiree and come up under the southern coast of the great Isle of
Mull.

All day the breeze held in the same point, and rather freshened than
died down; and towards afternoon, a swell began to set in from round the
outer Hebrides. Our course, to go round about the inner isles, was to
the west of south, so that at first we had this swell upon our beam, and
were much rolled about. But after nightfall, when we had turned the end
of Tiree and began to head more to the east, the sea came right astern.

Meanwhile, the early part of the day, before the swell came up, was
very pleasant; sailing, as we were, in a bright sunshine and with
many mountainous islands upon different sides. Alan and I sat in the
round-house with the doors open on each side (the wind being straight
astern), and smoked a pipe or two of the captain’s fine tobacco. It was
at this time we heard each other’s stories, which was the more important
to me, as I gained some knowledge of that wild Highland country on which
I was so soon to land. In those days, so close on the back of the great
rebellion, it was needful a man should know what he was doing when he
went upon the heather.

It was I that showed the example, telling him all my misfortune; which
he heard with great good-nature. Only, when I came to mention that good
friend of mine, Mr. Campbell the minister, Alan fired up and cried out
that he hated all that were of that name.

“Why,” said I, “he is a man you should be proud to give your hand to.”

“I know nothing I would help a Campbell to,” says he, “unless it was a
leaden bullet. I would hunt all of that name like blackcocks. If I lay
dying, I would crawl upon my knees to my chamber window for a shot at
one.”

“Why, Alan,” I cried, “what ails ye at the Campbells?”

“Well,” says he, “ye ken very well that I am an Appin Stewart, and the
Campbells have long harried and wasted those of my name; ay, and got
lands of us by treachery--but never with the sword,” he cried loudly,
and with the word brought down his fist upon the table. But I paid the
less attention to this, for I knew it was usually said by those who have
the underhand. “There’s more than that,” he continued, “and all in the
same story: lying words, lying papers, tricks fit for a peddler, and the
show of what’s legal over all, to make a man the more angry.”

“You that are so wasteful of your buttons,” said I, “I can hardly think
you would be a good judge of business.”

“Ah!” says he, falling again to smiling, “I got my wastefulness from
the same man I got the buttons from; and that was my poor father, Duncan
Stewart, grace be to him! He was the prettiest man of his kindred; and
the best swordsman in the Hielands, David, and that is the same as to
say, in all the world, I should ken, for it was him that taught me.
He was in the Black Watch, when first it was mustered; and, like other
gentlemen privates, had a gillie at his back to carry his firelock for
him on the march. Well, the King, it appears, was wishful to see Hieland
swordsmanship; and my father and three more were chosen out and sent to
London town, to let him see it at the best. So they were had into the
palace and showed the whole art of the sword for two hours at a stretch,
before King George and Queen Carline, and the Butcher Cumberland, and
many more of whom I havenae mind. And when they were through, the King
(for all he was a rank usurper) spoke them fair and gave each man three
guineas in his hand. Now, as they were going out of the palace, they
had a porter’s lodge to go by; and it came in on my father, as he was
perhaps the first private Hieland gentleman that had ever gone by that
door, it was right he should give the poor porter a proper notion of
their quality. So he gives the King’s three guineas into the man’s hand,
as if it was his common custom; the three others that came behind him
did the same; and there they were on the street, never a penny the
better for their pains. Some say it was one, that was the first to fee
the King’s porter; and some say it was another; but the truth of it is,
that it was Duncan Stewart, as I am willing to prove with either sword
or pistol. And that was the father that I had, God rest him!”

“I think he was not the man to leave you rich,” said I.

“And that’s true,” said Alan. “He left me my breeks to cover me, and
little besides. And that was how I came to enlist, which was a black
spot upon my character at the best of times, and would still be a sore
job for me if I fell among the red-coats.”

“What,” cried I, “were you in the English army?”

“That was I,” said Alan. “But I deserted to the right side at Preston
Pans--and that’s some comfort.”

I could scarcely share this view: holding desertion under arms for an
unpardonable fault in honour. But for all I was so young, I was wiser
than say my thought. “Dear, dear,” says I, “the punishment is death.”

“Ay” said he, “if they got hands on me, it would be a short shrift and
a lang tow for Alan! But I have the King of France’s commission in my
pocket, which would aye be some protection.”

“I misdoubt it much,” said I.

“I have doubts mysel’,” said Alan drily.

“And, good heaven, man,” cried I, “you that are a condemned rebel, and a
deserter, and a man of the French King’s--what tempts ye back into this
country? It’s a braving of Providence.”

“Tut!” says Alan, “I have been back every year since forty-six!”

“And what brings ye, man?” cried I.

“Well, ye see, I weary for my friends and country,” said he. “France is
a braw place, nae doubt; but I weary for the heather and the deer. And
then I have bit things that I attend to. Whiles I pick up a few lads
to serve the King of France: recruits, ye see; and that’s aye a
little money. But the heart of the matter is the business of my chief,
Ardshiel.”

“I thought they called your chief Appin,” said I.

“Ay, but Ardshiel is the captain of the clan,” said he, which scarcely
cleared my mind. “Ye see, David, he that was all his life so great a
man, and come of the blood and bearing the name of kings, is now brought
down to live in a French town like a poor and private person. He that
had four hundred swords at his whistle, I have seen, with these eyes
of mine, buying butter in the market-place, and taking it home in a
kale-leaf. This is not only a pain but a disgrace to us of his family
and clan. There are the bairns forby, the children and the hope of
Appin, that must be learned their letters and how to hold a sword, in
that far country. Now, the tenants of Appin have to pay a rent to King
George; but their hearts are staunch, they are true to their chief; and
what with love and a bit of pressure, and maybe a threat or two, the
poor folk scrape up a second rent for Ardshiel. Well, David, I’m the
hand that carries it.” And he struck the belt about his body, so that
the guineas rang.

“Do they pay both?” cried I.

“Ay, David, both,” says he.

“What! two rents?” I repeated.

“Ay, David,” said he. “I told a different tale to yon captain man; but
this is the truth of it. And it’s wonderful to me how little pressure
is needed. But that’s the handiwork of my good kinsman and my father’s
friend, James of the Glens: James Stewart, that is: Ardshiel’s
half-brother. He it is that gets the money in, and does the management.”

This was the first time I heard the name of that James Stewart, who was
afterwards so famous at the time of his hanging. But I took little heed
at the moment, for all my mind was occupied with the generosity of these
poor Highlanders.

“I call it noble,” I cried. “I’m a Whig, or little better; but I call it
noble.”

“Ay” said he, “ye’re a Whig, but ye’re a gentleman; and that’s what does
it. Now, if ye were one of the cursed race of Campbell, ye would gnash
your teeth to hear tell of it. If ye were the Red Fox...” And at that
name, his teeth shut together, and he ceased speaking. I have seen many
a grim face, but never a grimmer than Alan’s when he had named the Red
Fox.

“And who is the Red Fox?” I asked, daunted, but still curious.

“Who is he?” cried Alan. “Well, and I’ll tell you that. When the men of
the clans were broken at Culloden, and the good cause went down, and the
horses rode over the fetlocks in the best blood of the north, Ardshiel
had to flee like a poor deer upon the mountains--he and his lady and his
bairns. A sair job we had of it before we got him shipped; and while he
still lay in the heather, the English rogues, that couldnae come at his
life, were striking at his rights. They stripped him of his powers; they
stripped him of his lands; they plucked the weapons from the hands of
his clansmen, that had borne arms for thirty centuries; ay, and the very
clothes off their backs--so that it’s now a sin to wear a tartan plaid,
and a man may be cast into a gaol if he has but a kilt about his legs.
One thing they couldnae kill. That was the love the clansmen bore their
chief. These guineas are the proof of it. And now, in there steps a man,
a Campbell, red-headed Colin of Glenure----”

“Is that him you call the Red Fox?” said I.

“Will ye bring me his brush?” cries Alan, fiercely. “Ay, that’s the man.
In he steps, and gets papers from King George, to be so-called King’s
factor on the lands of Appin. And at first he sings small, and is
hail-fellow-well-met with Sheamus--that’s James of the Glens, my
chieftain’s agent. But by-and-by, that came to his ears that I have just
told you; how the poor commons of Appin, the farmers and the crofters
and the boumen, were wringing their very plaids to get a second rent,
and send it over-seas for Ardshiel and his poor bairns. What was it ye
called it, when I told ye?”

“I called it noble, Alan,” said I.

“And you little better than a common Whig!” cries Alan. “But when it
came to Colin Roy, the black Campbell blood in him ran wild. He sat
gnashing his teeth at the wine table. What! should a Stewart get a bite
of bread, and him not be able to prevent it? Ah! Red Fox, if ever I
hold you at a gun’s end, the Lord have pity upon ye!” (Alan stopped to
swallow down his anger.) “Well, David, what does he do? He declares all
the farms to let. And, thinks he, in his black heart, ‘I’ll soon get
other tenants that’ll overbid these Stewarts, and Maccolls, and Macrobs’
(for these are all names in my clan, David); ‘and then,’ thinks he,
‘Ardshiel will have to hold his bonnet on a French roadside.’”

“Well,” said I, “what followed?”

Alan laid down his pipe, which he had long since suffered to go out, and
set his two hands upon his knees.

“Ay,” said he, “ye’ll never guess that! For these same Stewarts, and
Maccolls, and Macrobs (that had two rents to pay, one to King George
by stark force, and one to Ardshiel by natural kindness) offered him a
better price than any Campbell in all broad Scotland; and far he
sent seeking them--as far as to the sides of Clyde and the cross of
Edinburgh--seeking, and fleeching, and begging them to come, where there
was a Stewart to be starved and a red-headed hound of a Campbell to be
pleasured!”

“Well, Alan,” said I, “that is a strange story, and a fine one, too. And
Whig as I may be, I am glad the man was beaten.”

“Him beaten?” echoed Alan. “It’s little ye ken of Campbells, and less
of the Red Fox. Him beaten? No: nor will be, till his blood’s on the
hillside! But if the day comes, David man, that I can find time and
leisure for a bit of hunting, there grows not enough heather in all
Scotland to hide him from my vengeance!”

“Man Alan,” said I, “ye are neither very wise nor very Christian to
blow off so many words of anger. They will do the man ye call the Fox no
harm, and yourself no good. Tell me your tale plainly out. What did he
next?”

“And that’s a good observe, David,” said Alan. “Troth and indeed,
they will do him no harm; the more’s the pity! And barring that about
Christianity (of which my opinion is quite otherwise, or I would be nae
Christian), I am much of your mind.”

“Opinion here or opinion there,” said I, “it’s a kent thing that
Christianity forbids revenge.”

“Ay” said he, “it’s well seen it was a Campbell taught ye! It would be
a convenient world for them and their sort, if there was no such a thing
as a lad and a gun behind a heather bush! But that’s nothing to the
point. This is what he did.”

“Ay” said I, “come to that.”

“Well, David,” said he, “since he couldnae be rid of the loyal commons
by fair means, he swore he would be rid of them by foul. Ardshiel was to
starve: that was the thing he aimed at. And since them that fed him in
his exile wouldnae be bought out--right or wrong, he would drive them
out. Therefore he sent for lawyers, and papers, and red-coats to stand
at his back. And the kindly folk of that country must all pack and
tramp, every father’s son out of his father’s house, and out of the
place where he was bred and fed, and played when he was a callant. And
who are to succeed them? Bare-leggit beggars! King George is to whistle
for his rents; he maun dow with less; he can spread his butter thinner:
what cares Red Colin? If he can hurt Ardshiel, he has his wish; if he
can pluck the meat from my chieftain’s table, and the bit toys out of
his children’s hands, he will gang hame singing to Glenure!”

“Let me have a word,” said I. “Be sure, if they take less rents, be
sure Government has a finger in the pie. It’s not this Campbell’s fault,
man--it’s his orders. And if ye killed this Colin to-morrow, what better
would ye be? There would be another factor in his shoes, as fast as spur
can drive.”

“Ye’re a good lad in a fight,” said Alan; “but, man! ye have Whig blood
in ye!”

He spoke kindly enough, but there was so much anger under his contempt
that I thought it was wise to change the conversation. I expressed my
wonder how, with the Highlands covered with troops, and guarded like
a city in a siege, a man in his situation could come and go without
arrest.

“It’s easier than ye would think,” said Alan. “A bare hillside (ye see)
is like all one road; if there’s a sentry at one place, ye just go by
another. And then the heather’s a great help. And everywhere there are
friends’ houses and friends’ byres and haystacks. And besides, when folk
talk of a country covered with troops, it’s but a kind of a byword at
the best. A soldier covers nae mair of it than his boot-soles. I have
fished a water with a sentry on the other side of the brae, and killed a
fine trout; and I have sat in a heather bush within six feet of another,
and learned a real bonny tune from his whistling. This was it,” said he,
and whistled me the air.

“And then, besides,” he continued, “it’s no sae bad now as it was in
forty-six. The Hielands are what they call pacified. Small wonder, with
never a gun or a sword left from Cantyre to Cape Wrath, but what tenty*
folk have hidden in their thatch! But what I would like to ken, David,
is just how long? Not long, ye would think, with men like Ardshiel in
exile and men like the Red Fox sitting birling the wine and oppressing
the poor at home. But it’s a kittle thing to decide what folk’ll bear,
and what they will not. Or why would Red Colin be riding his horse all
over my poor country of Appin, and never a pretty lad to put a bullet in
him?”

     * Careful.

And with this Alan fell into a muse, and for a long time sate very sad
and silent.

I will add the rest of what I have to say about my friend, that he
was skilled in all kinds of music, but principally pipe-music; was a
well-considered poet in his own tongue; had read several books both in
French and English; was a dead shot, a good angler, and an excellent
fencer with the small sword as well as with his own particular weapon.
For his faults, they were on his face, and I now knew them all. But
the worst of them, his childish propensity to take offence and to pick
quarrels, he greatly laid aside in my case, out of regard for the battle
of the round-house. But whether it was because I had done well myself,
or because I had been a witness of his own much greater prowess, is more
than I can tell. For though he had a great taste for courage in other
men, yet he admired it most in Alan Breck.




CHAPTER XIII

THE LOSS OF THE BRIG

It was already late at night, and as dark as it ever would be at that
season of the year (and that is to say, it was still pretty bright),
when Hoseason clapped his head into the round-house door.

“Here,” said he, “come out and see if ye can pilot.”

“Is this one of your tricks?” asked Alan.

“Do I look like tricks?” cries the captain. “I have other things to
think of--my brig’s in danger!”

By the concerned look of his face, and, above all, by the sharp tones in
which he spoke of his brig, it was plain to both of us he was in deadly
earnest; and so Alan and I, with no great fear of treachery, stepped on
deck.

The sky was clear; it blew hard, and was bitter cold; a great deal of
daylight lingered; and the moon, which was nearly full, shone brightly.
The brig was close hauled, so as to round the southwest corner of the
Island of Mull, the hills of which (and Ben More above them all, with a
wisp of mist upon the top of it) lay full upon the lar-board bow. Though
it was no good point of sailing for the Covenant, she tore through
the seas at a great rate, pitching and straining, and pursued by the
westerly swell.

Altogether it was no such ill night to keep the seas in; and I had begun
to wonder what it was that sat so heavily upon the captain, when the
brig rising suddenly on the top of a high swell, he pointed and cried to
us to look. Away on the lee bow, a thing like a fountain rose out of the
moonlit sea, and immediately after we heard a low sound of roaring.

“What do ye call that?” asked the captain, gloomily.

“The sea breaking on a reef,” said Alan. “And now ye ken where it is;
and what better would ye have?”

“Ay,” said Hoseason, “if it was the only one.”

And sure enough, just as he spoke there came a second fountain farther
to the south.

“There!” said Hoseason. “Ye see for yourself. If I had kent of these
reefs, if I had had a chart, or if Shuan had been spared, it’s not sixty
guineas, no, nor six hundred, would have made me risk my brig in sic a
stoneyard! But you, sir, that was to pilot us, have ye never a word?”

“I’m thinking,” said Alan, “these’ll be what they call the Torran
Rocks.”

“Are there many of them?” says the captain.

“Truly, sir, I am nae pilot,” said Alan; “but it sticks in my mind there
are ten miles of them.”

Mr. Riach and the captain looked at each other.

“There’s a way through them, I suppose?” said the captain.

“Doubtless,” said Alan, “but where? But it somehow runs in my mind once
more that it is clearer under the land.”

“So?” said Hoseason. “We’ll have to haul our wind then, Mr. Riach; we’ll
have to come as near in about the end of Mull as we can take her, sir;
and even then we’ll have the land to kep the wind off us, and that
stoneyard on our lee. Well, we’re in for it now, and may as well crack
on.”

With that he gave an order to the steersman, and sent Riach to the
foretop. There were only five men on deck, counting the officers; these
being all that were fit (or, at least, both fit and willing) for their
work. So, as I say, it fell to Mr. Riach to go aloft, and he sat there
looking out and hailing the deck with news of all he saw.

“The sea to the south is thick,” he cried; and then, after a while, “it
does seem clearer in by the land.”

“Well, sir,” said Hoseason to Alan, “we’ll try your way of it. But I
think I might as well trust to a blind fiddler. Pray God you’re right.”

“Pray God I am!” says Alan to me. “But where did I hear it? Well, well,
it will be as it must.”

As we got nearer to the turn of the land the reefs began to be sown here
and there on our very path; and Mr. Riach sometimes cried down to us to
change the course. Sometimes, indeed, none too soon; for one reef was
so close on the brig’s weather board that when a sea burst upon it the
lighter sprays fell upon her deck and wetted us like rain.

The brightness of the night showed us these perils as clearly as by day,
which was, perhaps, the more alarming. It showed me, too, the face of
the captain as he stood by the steersman, now on one foot, now on the
other, and sometimes blowing in his hands, but still listening and
looking and as steady as steel. Neither he nor Mr. Riach had shown
well in the fighting; but I saw they were brave in their own trade, and
admired them all the more because I found Alan very white.

“Ochone, David,” says he, “this is no the kind of death I fancy!”

“What, Alan!” I cried, “you’re not afraid?”

“No,” said he, wetting his lips, “but you’ll allow, yourself, it’s a
cold ending.”

By this time, now and then sheering to one side or the other to avoid a
reef, but still hugging the wind and the land, we had got round Iona and
begun to come alongside Mull. The tide at the tail of the land ran very
strong, and threw the brig about. Two hands were put to the helm, and
Hoseason himself would sometimes lend a help; and it was strange to
see three strong men throw their weight upon the tiller, and it (like a
living thing) struggle against and drive them back. This would have
been the greater danger had not the sea been for some while free of
obstacles. Mr. Riach, besides, announced from the top that he saw clear
water ahead.

“Ye were right,” said Hoseason to Alan. “Ye have saved the brig, sir.
I’ll mind that when we come to clear accounts.” And I believe he not
only meant what he said, but would have done it; so high a place did the
Covenant hold in his affections.

But this is matter only for conjecture, things having gone otherwise
than he forecast.

“Keep her away a point,” sings out Mr. Riach. “Reef to windward!”

And just at the same time the tide caught the brig, and threw the wind
out of her sails. She came round into the wind like a top, and the next
moment struck the reef with such a dunch as threw us all flat upon the
deck, and came near to shake Mr. Riach from his place upon the mast.

I was on my feet in a minute. The reef on which we had struck was close
in under the southwest end of Mull, off a little isle they call Earraid,
which lay low and black upon the larboard. Sometimes the swell broke
clean over us; sometimes it only ground the poor brig upon the reef, so
that we could hear her beat herself to pieces; and what with the great
noise of the sails, and the singing of the wind, and the flying of the
spray in the moonlight, and the sense of danger, I think my head must
have been partly turned, for I could scarcely understand the things I
saw.

Presently I observed Mr. Riach and the seamen busy round the skiff, and,
still in the same blank, ran over to assist them; and as soon as I set
my hand to work, my mind came clear again. It was no very easy task, for
the skiff lay amidships and was full of hamper, and the breaking of the
heavier seas continually forced us to give over and hold on; but we all
wrought like horses while we could.

Meanwhile such of the wounded as could move came clambering out of the
fore-scuttle and began to help; while the rest that lay helpless in
their bunks harrowed me with screaming and begging to be saved.

The captain took no part. It seemed he was struck stupid. He stood
holding by the shrouds, talking to himself and groaning out aloud
whenever the ship hammered on the rock. His brig was like wife and
child to him; he had looked on, day by day, at the mishandling of poor
Ransome; but when it came to the brig, he seemed to suffer along with
her.

All the time of our working at the boat, I remember only one other
thing: that I asked Alan, looking across at the shore, what country it
was; and he answered, it was the worst possible for him, for it was a
land of the Campbells.

We had one of the wounded men told off to keep a watch upon the seas and
cry us warning. Well, we had the boat about ready to be launched, when
this man sang out pretty shrill: “For God’s sake, hold on!” We knew
by his tone that it was something more than ordinary; and sure enough,
there followed a sea so huge that it lifted the brig right up and canted
her over on her beam. Whether the cry came too late, or my hold was too
weak, I know not; but at the sudden tilting of the ship I was cast clean
over the bulwarks into the sea.

I went down, and drank my fill, and then came up, and got a blink of the
moon, and then down again. They say a man sinks a third time for good. I
cannot be made like other folk, then; for I would not like to write how
often I went down, or how often I came up again. All the while, I was
being hurled along, and beaten upon and choked, and then swallowed
whole; and the thing was so distracting to my wits, that I was neither
sorry nor afraid.

Presently, I found I was holding to a spar, which helped me somewhat.
And then all of a sudden I was in quiet water, and began to come to
myself.

It was the spare yard I had got hold of, and I was amazed to see how far
I had travelled from the brig. I hailed her, indeed; but it was plain
she was already out of cry. She was still holding together; but whether
or not they had yet launched the boat, I was too far off and too low
down to see.

While I was hailing the brig, I spied a tract of water lying between
us where no great waves came, but which yet boiled white all over and
bristled in the moon with rings and bubbles. Sometimes the whole tract
swung to one side, like the tail of a live serpent; sometimes, for a
glimpse, it would all disappear and then boil up again. What it was I
had no guess, which for the time increased my fear of it; but I now know
it must have been the roost or tide race, which had carried me away so
fast and tumbled me about so cruelly, and at last, as if tired of that
play, had flung out me and the spare yard upon its landward margin.

I now lay quite becalmed, and began to feel that a man can die of cold
as well as of drowning. The shores of Earraid were close in; I could see
in the moonlight the dots of heather and the sparkling of the mica in
the rocks.

“Well,” thought I to myself, “if I cannot get as far as that, it’s
strange!”

I had no skill of swimming, Essen Water being small in our
neighbourhood; but when I laid hold upon the yard with both arms, and
kicked out with both feet, I soon begun to find that I was moving. Hard
work it was, and mortally slow; but in about an hour of kicking
and splashing, I had got well in between the points of a sandy bay
surrounded by low hills.

The sea was here quite quiet; there was no sound of any surf; the moon
shone clear; and I thought in my heart I had never seen a place so
desert and desolate. But it was dry land; and when at last it grew so
shallow that I could leave the yard and wade ashore upon my feet, I
cannot tell if I was more tired or more grateful. Both, at least, I was:
tired as I never was before that night; and grateful to God as I trust I
have been often, though never with more cause.




CHAPTER XIV

THE ISLET

With my stepping ashore I began the most unhappy part of my adventures.
It was half-past twelve in the morning, and though the wind was broken
by the land, it was a cold night. I dared not sit down (for I thought
I should have frozen), but took off my shoes and walked to and fro upon
the sand, bare-foot, and beating my breast with infinite weariness.
There was no sound of man or cattle; not a cock crew, though it was
about the hour of their first waking; only the surf broke outside in the
distance, which put me in mind of my perils and those of my friend.
To walk by the sea at that hour of the morning, and in a place so
desert-like and lonesome, struck me with a kind of fear.

As soon as the day began to break I put on my shoes and climbed a
hill--the ruggedest scramble I ever undertook--falling, the whole way,
between big blocks of granite, or leaping from one to another. When I
got to the top the dawn was come. There was no sign of the brig, which
must have lifted from the reef and sunk. The boat, too, was nowhere to
be seen. There was never a sail upon the ocean; and in what I could see
of the land was neither house nor man.

I was afraid to think what had befallen my shipmates, and afraid to look
longer at so empty a scene. What with my wet clothes and weariness, and
my belly that now began to ache with hunger, I had enough to trouble
me without that. So I set off eastward along the south coast, hoping to
find a house where I might warm myself, and perhaps get news of those I
had lost. And at the worst, I considered the sun would soon rise and dry
my clothes.

After a little, my way was stopped by a creek or inlet of the sea, which
seemed to run pretty deep into the land; and as I had no means to get
across, I must needs change my direction to go about the end of it. It
was still the roughest kind of walking; indeed the whole, not only of
Earraid, but of the neighbouring part of Mull (which they call the Ross)
is nothing but a jumble of granite rocks with heather in among. At first
the creek kept narrowing as I had looked to see; but presently to my
surprise it began to widen out again. At this I scratched my head,
but had still no notion of the truth: until at last I came to a rising
ground, and it burst upon me all in a moment that I was cast upon a
little barren isle, and cut off on every side by the salt seas.

Instead of the sun rising to dry me, it came on to rain, with a thick
mist; so that my case was lamentable.

I stood in the rain, and shivered, and wondered what to do, till it
occurred to me that perhaps the creek was fordable. Back I went to the
narrowest point and waded in. But not three yards from shore, I plumped
in head over ears; and if ever I was heard of more, it was rather by
God’s grace than my own prudence. I was no wetter (for that could hardly
be), but I was all the colder for this mishap; and having lost another
hope was the more unhappy.

And now, all at once, the yard came in my head. What had carried me
through the roost would surely serve me to cross this little quiet creek
in safety. With that I set off, undaunted, across the top of the isle,
to fetch and carry it back. It was a weary tramp in all ways, and if
hope had not buoyed me up, I must have cast myself down and given up.
Whether with the sea salt, or because I was growing fevered, I was
distressed with thirst, and had to stop, as I went, and drink the peaty
water out of the hags.

I came to the bay at last, more dead than alive; and at the first
glance, I thought the yard was something farther out than when I left
it. In I went, for the third time, into the sea. The sand was smooth
and firm, and shelved gradually down, so that I could wade out till the
water was almost to my neck and the little waves splashed into my face.
But at that depth my feet began to leave me, and I durst venture in no
farther. As for the yard, I saw it bobbing very quietly some twenty feet
beyond.

I had borne up well until this last disappointment; but at that I came
ashore, and flung myself down upon the sands and wept.

The time I spent upon the island is still so horrible a thought to me,
that I must pass it lightly over. In all the books I have read of people
cast away, they had either their pockets full of tools, or a chest of
things would be thrown upon the beach along with them, as if on purpose.
My case was very different. I had nothing in my pockets but money and
Alan’s silver button; and being inland bred, I was as much short of
knowledge as of means.

I knew indeed that shell-fish were counted good to eat; and among the
rocks of the isle I found a great plenty of limpets, which at first I
could scarcely strike from their places, not knowing quickness to be
needful. There were, besides, some of the little shells that we call
buckies; I think periwinkle is the English name. Of these two I made my
whole diet, devouring them cold and raw as I found them; and so hungry
was I, that at first they seemed to me delicious.

Perhaps they were out of season, or perhaps there was something wrong
in the sea about my island. But at least I had no sooner eaten my first
meal than I was seized with giddiness and retching, and lay for a long
time no better than dead. A second trial of the same food (indeed I had
no other) did better with me, and revived my strength. But as long as
I was on the island, I never knew what to expect when I had eaten;
sometimes all was well, and sometimes I was thrown into a miserable
sickness; nor could I ever distinguish what particular fish it was that
hurt me.

All day it streamed rain; the island ran like a sop, there was no dry
spot to be found; and when I lay down that night, between two boulders
that made a kind of roof, my feet were in a bog.

The second day I crossed the island to all sides. There was no one part
of it better than another; it was all desolate and rocky; nothing living
on it but game birds which I lacked the means to kill, and the gulls
which haunted the outlying rocks in a prodigious number. But the creek,
or strait, that cut off the isle from the main-land of the Ross, opened
out on the north into a bay, and the bay again opened into the Sound of
Iona; and it was the neighbourhood of this place that I chose to be my
home; though if I had thought upon the very name of home in such a spot,
I must have burst out weeping.

I had good reasons for my choice. There was in this part of the isle a
little hut of a house like a pig’s hut, where fishers used to sleep when
they came there upon their business; but the turf roof of it had fallen
entirely in; so that the hut was of no use to me, and gave me less
shelter than my rocks. What was more important, the shell-fish on which
I lived grew there in great plenty; when the tide was out I could gather
a peck at a time: and this was doubtless a convenience. But the other
reason went deeper. I had become in no way used to the horrid solitude
of the isle, but still looked round me on all sides (like a man that
was hunted), between fear and hope that I might see some human creature
coming. Now, from a little up the hillside over the bay, I could catch a
sight of the great, ancient church and the roofs of the people’s houses
in Iona. And on the other hand, over the low country of the Ross, I saw
smoke go up, morning and evening, as if from a homestead in a hollow of
the land.

I used to watch this smoke, when I was wet and cold, and had my head
half turned with loneliness; and think of the fireside and the
company, till my heart burned. It was the same with the roofs of Iona.
Altogether, this sight I had of men’s homes and comfortable lives,
although it put a point on my own sufferings, yet it kept hope alive,
and helped me to eat my raw shell-fish (which had soon grown to be a
disgust), and saved me from the sense of horror I had whenever I was
quite alone with dead rocks, and fowls, and the rain, and the cold sea.

I say it kept hope alive; and indeed it seemed impossible that I should
be left to die on the shores of my own country, and within view of a
church-tower and the smoke of men’s houses. But the second day passed;
and though as long as the light lasted I kept a bright look-out for
boats on the Sound or men passing on the Ross, no help came near me. It
still rained, and I turned in to sleep, as wet as ever, and with a cruel
sore throat, but a little comforted, perhaps, by having said good-night
to my next neighbours, the people of Iona.

Charles the Second declared a man could stay outdoors more days in the
year in the climate of England than in any other. This was very like a
king, with a palace at his back and changes of dry clothes. But he must
have had better luck on his flight from Worcester than I had on that
miserable isle. It was the height of the summer; yet it rained for more
than twenty-four hours, and did not clear until the afternoon of the
third day.

This was the day of incidents. In the morning I saw a red deer, a buck
with a fine spread of antlers, standing in the rain on the top of the
island; but he had scarce seen me rise from under my rock, before
he trotted off upon the other side. I supposed he must have swum the
strait; though what should bring any creature to Earraid, was more than
I could fancy.

A little after, as I was jumping about after my limpets, I was startled
by a guinea-piece, which fell upon a rock in front of me and glanced off
into the sea. When the sailors gave me my money again, they kept back
not only about a third of the whole sum, but my father’s leather purse;
so that from that day out, I carried my gold loose in a pocket with a
button. I now saw there must be a hole, and clapped my hand to the place
in a great hurry. But this was to lock the stable door after the steed
was stolen. I had left the shore at Queensferry with near on fifty
pounds; now I found no more than two guinea-pieces and a silver
shilling.

It is true I picked up a third guinea a little after, where it lay
shining on a piece of turf. That made a fortune of three pounds and four
shillings, English money, for a lad, the rightful heir of an estate, and
now starving on an isle at the extreme end of the wild Highlands.

This state of my affairs dashed me still further; and, indeed my plight
on that third morning was truly pitiful. My clothes were beginning to
rot; my stockings in particular were quite worn through, so that my
shanks went naked; my hands had grown quite soft with the continual
soaking; my throat was very sore, my strength had much abated, and my
heart so turned against the horrid stuff I was condemned to eat, that
the very sight of it came near to sicken me.

And yet the worst was not yet come.

There is a pretty high rock on the northwest of Earraid, which (because
it had a flat top and overlooked the Sound) I was much in the habit of
frequenting; not that ever I stayed in one place, save when asleep, my
misery giving me no rest. Indeed, I wore myself down with continual and
aimless goings and comings in the rain.

As soon, however, as the sun came out, I lay down on the top of that
rock to dry myself. The comfort of the sunshine is a thing I cannot
tell. It set me thinking hopefully of my deliverance, of which I had
begun to despair; and I scanned the sea and the Ross with a fresh
interest. On the south of my rock, a part of the island jutted out and
hid the open ocean, so that a boat could thus come quite near me upon
that side, and I be none the wiser.

Well, all of a sudden, a coble with a brown sail and a pair of fishers
aboard of it, came flying round that corner of the isle, bound for Iona.
I shouted out, and then fell on my knees on the rock and reached up my
hands and prayed to them. They were near enough to hear--I could even
see the colour of their hair; and there was no doubt but they observed
me, for they cried out in the Gaelic tongue, and laughed. But the boat
never turned aside, and flew on, right before my eyes, for Iona.

I could not believe such wickedness, and ran along the shore from rock
to rock, crying on them piteously even after they were out of reach
of my voice, I still cried and waved to them; and when they were quite
gone, I thought my heart would have burst. All the time of my troubles
I wept only twice. Once, when I could not reach the yard, and now, the
second time, when these fishers turned a deaf ear to my cries. But this
time I wept and roared like a wicked child, tearing up the turf with
my nails, and grinding my face in the earth. If a wish would kill men,
those two fishers would never have seen morning, and I should likely
have died upon my island.

When I was a little over my anger, I must eat again, but with such
loathing of the mess as I could now scarce control. Sure enough, I
should have done as well to fast, for my fishes poisoned me again. I had
all my first pains; my throat was so sore I could scarce swallow; I had
a fit of strong shuddering, which clucked my teeth together; and there
came on me that dreadful sense of illness, which we have no name for
either in Scotch or English. I thought I should have died, and made my
peace with God, forgiving all men, even my uncle and the fishers; and as
soon as I had thus made up my mind to the worst, clearness came upon me;
I observed the night was falling dry; my clothes were dried a good deal;
truly, I was in a better case than ever before, since I had landed on
the isle; and so I got to sleep at last, with a thought of gratitude.

The next day (which was the fourth of this horrible life of mine) I
found my bodily strength run very low. But the sun shone, the air was
sweet, and what I managed to eat of the shell-fish agreed well with me
and revived my courage.

I was scarce back on my rock (where I went always the first thing after
I had eaten) before I observed a boat coming down the Sound, and with
her head, as I thought, in my direction.

I began at once to hope and fear exceedingly; for I thought these men
might have thought better of their cruelty and be coming back to my
assistance. But another disappointment, such as yesterday’s, was more
than I could bear. I turned my back, accordingly, upon the sea, and
did not look again till I had counted many hundreds. The boat was still
heading for the island. The next time I counted the full thousand, as
slowly as I could, my heart beating so as to hurt me. And then it was
out of all question. She was coming straight to Earraid!

I could no longer hold myself back, but ran to the seaside and out,
from one rock to another, as far as I could go. It is a marvel I was not
drowned; for when I was brought to a stand at last, my legs shook under
me, and my mouth was so dry, I must wet it with the sea-water before I
was able to shout.

All this time the boat was coming on; and now I was able to perceive
it was the same boat and the same two men as yesterday. This I knew by
their hair, which the one had of a bright yellow and the other black.
But now there was a third man along with them, who looked to be of a
better class.

As soon as they were come within easy speech, they let down their sail
and lay quiet. In spite of my supplications, they drew no nearer in, and
what frightened me most of all, the new man tee-hee’d with laughter as
he talked and looked at me.

Then he stood up in the boat and addressed me a long while, speaking
fast and with many wavings of his hand. I told him I had no Gaelic; and
at this he became very angry, and I began to suspect he thought he was
talking English. Listening very close, I caught the word “whateffer”
 several times; but all the rest was Gaelic and might have been Greek and
Hebrew for me.

“Whatever,” said I, to show him I had caught a word.

“Yes, yes--yes, yes,” says he, and then he looked at the other men, as
much as to say, “I told you I spoke English,” and began again as hard as
ever in the Gaelic.

This time I picked out another word, “tide.” Then I had a flash of hope.
I remembered he was always waving his hand towards the mainland of the
Ross.

“Do you mean when the tide is out--?” I cried, and could not finish.

“Yes, yes,” said he. “Tide.”

At that I turned tail upon their boat (where my adviser had once more
begun to tee-hee with laughter), leaped back the way I had come, from
one stone to another, and set off running across the isle as I had never
run before. In about half an hour I came out upon the shores of the
creek; and, sure enough, it was shrunk into a little trickle of water,
through which I dashed, not above my knees, and landed with a shout on
the main island.

A sea-bred boy would not have stayed a day on Earraid; which is only
what they call a tidal islet, and except in the bottom of the neaps, can
be entered and left twice in every twenty-four hours, either dry-shod,
or at the most by wading. Even I, who had the tide going out and in
before me in the bay, and even watched for the ebbs, the better to get
my shellfish--even I (I say) if I had sat down to think, instead of
raging at my fate, must have soon guessed the secret, and got free. It
was no wonder the fishers had not understood me. The wonder was rather
that they had ever guessed my pitiful illusion, and taken the trouble to
come back. I had starved with cold and hunger on that island for close
upon one hundred hours. But for the fishers, I might have left my bones
there, in pure folly. And even as it was, I had paid for it pretty dear,
not only in past sufferings, but in my present case; being clothed like
a beggar-man, scarce able to walk, and in great pain of my sore throat.

I have seen wicked men and fools, a great many of both; and I believe
they both get paid in the end; but the fools first.




CHAPTER XV

THE LAD WITH THE SILVER BUTTON: THROUGH THE ISLE OF MULL

The Ross of Mull, which I had now got upon, was rugged and trackless,
like the isle I had just left; being all bog, and brier, and big stone.
There may be roads for them that know that country well; but for my part
I had no better guide than my own nose, and no other landmark than Ben
More.

I aimed as well as I could for the smoke I had seen so often from the
island; and with all my great weariness and the difficulty of the way
came upon the house in the bottom of a little hollow about five or
six at night. It was low and longish, roofed with turf and built of
unmortared stones; and on a mound in front of it, an old gentleman sat
smoking his pipe in the sun.

With what little English he had, he gave me to understand that my
shipmates had got safe ashore, and had broken bread in that very house
on the day after.

“Was there one,” I asked, “dressed like a gentleman?”

He said they all wore rough great-coats; but to be sure, the first of
them, the one that came alone, wore breeches and stockings, while the
rest had sailors’ trousers.

“Ah,” said I, “and he would have a feathered hat?”

He told me, no, that he was bareheaded like myself.

At first I thought Alan might have lost his hat; and then the rain came
in my mind, and I judged it more likely he had it out of harm’s way
under his great-coat. This set me smiling, partly because my friend was
safe, partly to think of his vanity in dress.

And then the old gentleman clapped his hand to his brow, and cried out
that I must be the lad with the silver button.

“Why, yes!” said I, in some wonder.

“Well, then,” said the old gentleman, “I have a word for you, that you
are to follow your friend to his country, by Torosay.”

He then asked me how I had fared, and I told him my tale. A
south-country man would certainly have laughed; but this old gentleman
(I call him so because of his manners, for his clothes were dropping off
his back) heard me all through with nothing but gravity and pity. When I
had done, he took me by the hand, led me into his hut (it was no better)
and presented me before his wife, as if she had been the Queen and I a
duke.

The good woman set oat-bread before me and a cold grouse, patting my
shoulder and smiling to me all the time, for she had no English; and the
old gentleman (not to be behind) brewed me a strong punch out of their
country spirit. All the while I was eating, and after that when I was
drinking the punch, I could scarce come to believe in my good fortune;
and the house, though it was thick with the peat-smoke and as full of
holes as a colander, seemed like a palace.

The punch threw me in a strong sweat and a deep slumber; the good people
let me lie; and it was near noon of the next day before I took the road,
my throat already easier and my spirits quite restored by good fare and
good news. The old gentleman, although I pressed him hard, would take no
money, and gave me an old bonnet for my head; though I am free to own I
was no sooner out of view of the house than I very jealously washed this
gift of his in a wayside fountain.

Thought I to myself: “If these are the wild Highlanders, I could wish my
own folk wilder.”

I not only started late, but I must have wandered nearly half the time.
True, I met plenty of people, grubbing in little miserable fields that
would not keep a cat, or herding little kine about the bigness of asses.
The Highland dress being forbidden by law since the rebellion, and the
people condemned to the Lowland habit, which they much disliked, it was
strange to see the variety of their array. Some went bare, only for a
hanging cloak or great-coat, and carried their trousers on their backs
like a useless burthen: some had made an imitation of the tartan with
little parti-coloured stripes patched together like an old wife’s quilt;
others, again, still wore the Highland philabeg, but by putting a few
stitches between the legs transformed it into a pair of trousers like
a Dutchman’s. All those makeshifts were condemned and punished, for the
law was harshly applied, in hopes to break up the clan spirit; but in
that out-of-the-way, sea-bound isle, there were few to make remarks and
fewer to tell tales.

They seemed in great poverty; which was no doubt natural, now that
rapine was put down, and the chiefs kept no longer an open house;
and the roads (even such a wandering, country by-track as the one
I followed) were infested with beggars. And here again I marked
a difference from my own part of the country. For our Lowland
beggars--even the gownsmen themselves, who beg by patent--had a louting,
flattering way with them, and if you gave them a plaek and asked change,
would very civilly return you a boddle. But these Highland beggars stood
on their dignity, asked alms only to buy snuff (by their account) and
would give no change.

To be sure, this was no concern of mine, except in so far as it
entertained me by the way. What was much more to the purpose, few had
any English, and these few (unless they were of the brotherhood of
beggars) not very anxious to place it at my service. I knew Torosay
to be my destination, and repeated the name to them and pointed; but
instead of simply pointing in reply, they would give me a screed of the
Gaelic that set me foolish; so it was small wonder if I went out of my
road as often as I stayed in it.

At last, about eight at night, and already very weary, I came to a lone
house, where I asked admittance, and was refused, until I bethought
me of the power of money in so poor a country, and held up one of my
guineas in my finger and thumb. Thereupon, the man of the house, who had
hitherto pretended to have no English, and driven me from his door by
signals, suddenly began to speak as clearly as was needful, and agreed
for five shillings to give me a night’s lodging and guide me the next
day to Torosay.

I slept uneasily that night, fearing I should be robbed; but I might
have spared myself the pain; for my host was no robber, only miserably
poor and a great cheat. He was not alone in his poverty; for the next
morning, we must go five miles about to the house of what he called a
rich man to have one of my guineas changed. This was perhaps a rich man
for Mull; he would have scarce been thought so in the south; for it
took all he had--the whole house was turned upside down, and a neighbour
brought under contribution, before he could scrape together twenty
shillings in silver. The odd shilling he kept for himself, protesting he
could ill afford to have so great a sum of money lying “locked up.” For
all that he was very courteous and well spoken, made us both sit down
with his family to dinner, and brewed punch in a fine china bowl, over
which my rascal guide grew so merry that he refused to start.

I was for getting angry, and appealed to the rich man (Hector Maclean
was his name), who had been a witness to our bargain and to my payment
of the five shillings. But Maclean had taken his share of the punch,
and vowed that no gentleman should leave his table after the bowl was
brewed; so there was nothing for it but to sit and hear Jacobite toasts
and Gaelic songs, till all were tipsy and staggered off to the bed or
the barn for their night’s rest.

Next day (the fourth of my travels) we were up before five upon the
clock; but my rascal guide got to the bottle at once, and it was three
hours before I had him clear of the house, and then (as you shall hear)
only for a worse disappointment.

As long as we went down a heathery valley that lay before Mr. Maclean’s
house, all went well; only my guide looked constantly over his shoulder,
and when I asked him the cause, only grinned at me. No sooner, however,
had we crossed the back of a hill, and got out of sight of the house
windows, than he told me Torosay lay right in front, and that a hill-top
(which he pointed out) was my best landmark.

“I care very little for that,” said I, “since you are going with me.”

The impudent cheat answered me in the Gaelic that he had no English.

“My fine fellow,” I said, “I know very well your English comes and goes.
Tell me what will bring it back? Is it more money you wish?”

“Five shillings mair,” said he, “and hersel’ will bring ye there.”

I reflected awhile and then offered him two, which he accepted greedily,
and insisted on having in his hands at once “for luck,” as he said, but
I think it was rather for my misfortune.

The two shillings carried him not quite as many miles; at the end of
which distance, he sat down upon the wayside and took off his brogues
from his feet, like a man about to rest.

I was now red-hot. “Ha!” said I, “have you no more English?”

He said impudently, “No.”

At that I boiled over, and lifted my hand to strike him; and he, drawing
a knife from his rags, squatted back and grinned at me like a wildcat.
At that, forgetting everything but my anger, I ran in upon him, put
aside his knife with my left, and struck him in the mouth with the
right. I was a strong lad and very angry, and he but a little man; and
he went down before me heavily. By good luck, his knife flew out of his
hand as he fell.

I picked up both that and his brogues, wished him a good morning, and
set off upon my way, leaving him barefoot and disarmed. I chuckled to
myself as I went, being sure I was done with that rogue, for a variety
of reasons. First, he knew he could have no more of my money; next, the
brogues were worth in that country only a few pence; and, lastly, the
knife, which was really a dagger, it was against the law for him to
carry.

In about half an hour of walk, I overtook a great, ragged man, moving
pretty fast but feeling before him with a staff. He was quite blind, and
told me he was a catechist, which should have put me at my ease. But
his face went against me; it seemed dark and dangerous and secret; and
presently, as we began to go on alongside, I saw the steel butt of a
pistol sticking from under the flap of his coat-pocket. To carry such a
thing meant a fine of fifteen pounds sterling upon a first offence, and
transportation to the colonies upon a second. Nor could I quite see why
a religious teacher should go armed, or what a blind man could be doing
with a pistol.

I told him about my guide, for I was proud of what I had done, and my
vanity for once got the heels of my prudence. At the mention of the
five shillings he cried out so loud that I made up my mind I should say
nothing of the other two, and was glad he could not see my blushes.

“Was it too much?” I asked, a little faltering.

“Too much!” cries he. “Why, I will guide you to Torosay myself for a
dram of brandy. And give you the great pleasure of my company (me that
is a man of some learning) in the bargain.”

I said I did not see how a blind man could be a guide; but at that he
laughed aloud, and said his stick was eyes enough for an eagle.

“In the Isle of Mull, at least,” says he, “where I know every stone and
heather-bush by mark of head. See, now,” he said, striking right and
left, as if to make sure, “down there a burn is running; and at the head
of it there stands a bit of a small hill with a stone cocked upon the
top of that; and it’s hard at the foot of the hill, that the way runs by
to Torosay; and the way here, being for droves, is plainly trodden, and
will show grassy through the heather.”

I had to own he was right in every feature, and told my wonder.

“Ha!” says he, “that’s nothing. Would ye believe me now, that before
the Act came out, and when there were weepons in this country, I could
shoot? Ay, could I!” cries he, and then with a leer: “If ye had such a
thing as a pistol here to try with, I would show ye how it’s done.”

I told him I had nothing of the sort, and gave him a wider berth. If
he had known, his pistol stuck at that time quite plainly out of his
pocket, and I could see the sun twinkle on the steel of the butt. But
by the better luck for me, he knew nothing, thought all was covered, and
lied on in the dark.

He then began to question me cunningly, where I came from, whether I
was rich, whether I could change a five-shilling piece for him (which
he declared he had that moment in his sporran), and all the time he kept
edging up to me and I avoiding him. We were now upon a sort of green
cattle-track which crossed the hills towards Torosay, and we kept
changing sides upon that like dancers in a reel. I had so plainly the
upper-hand that my spirits rose, and indeed I took a pleasure in this
game of blindman’s buff; but the catechist grew angrier and angrier,
and at last began to swear in Gaelic and to strike for my legs with his
staff.

Then I told him that, sure enough, I had a pistol in my pocket as well
as he, and if he did not strike across the hill due south I would even
blow his brains out.

He became at once very polite, and after trying to soften me for some
time, but quite in vain, he cursed me once more in Gaelic and took
himself off. I watched him striding along, through bog and brier,
tapping with his stick, until he turned the end of a hill and
disappeared in the next hollow. Then I struck on again for Torosay, much
better pleased to be alone than to travel with that man of learning.
This was an unlucky day; and these two, of whom I had just rid myself,
one after the other, were the two worst men I met with in the Highlands.

At Torosay, on the Sound of Mull and looking over to the mainland
of Morven, there was an inn with an innkeeper, who was a Maclean, it
appeared, of a very high family; for to keep an inn is thought even more
genteel in the Highlands than it is with us, perhaps as partaking of
hospitality, or perhaps because the trade is idle and drunken. He spoke
good English, and finding me to be something of a scholar, tried me
first in French, where he easily beat me, and then in the Latin, in
which I don’t know which of us did best. This pleasant rivalry put us at
once upon friendly terms; and I sat up and drank punch with him (or to
be more correct, sat up and watched him drink it), until he was so tipsy
that he wept upon my shoulder.

I tried him, as if by accident, with a sight of Alan’s button; but it
was plain he had never seen or heard of it. Indeed, he bore some grudge
against the family and friends of Ardshiel, and before he was drunk
he read me a lampoon, in very good Latin, but with a very ill meaning,
which he had made in elegiac verses upon a person of that house.

When I told him of my catechist, he shook his head, and said I was lucky
to have got clear off. “That is a very dangerous man,” he said; “Duncan
Mackiegh is his name; he can shoot by the ear at several yards, and has
been often accused of highway robberies, and once of murder.”

“The cream of it is,” says I, “that he called himself a catechist.”

“And why should he not?” says he, “when that is what he is. It was
Maclean of Duart gave it to him because he was blind. But perhaps it was
a peety,” says my host, “for he is always on the road, going from
one place to another to hear the young folk say their religion; and,
doubtless, that is a great temptation to the poor man.”

At last, when my landlord could drink no more, he showed me to a bed,
and I lay down in very good spirits; having travelled the greater part
of that big and crooked Island of Mull, from Earraid to Torosay, fifty
miles as the crow flies, and (with my wanderings) much nearer a hundred,
in four days and with little fatigue. Indeed I was by far in better
heart and health of body at the end of that long tramp than I had been
at the beginning.




CHAPTER XVI

THE LAD WITH THE SILVER BUTTON: ACROSS MORVEN

There is a regular ferry from Torosay to Kinlochaline on the mainland.
Both shores of the Sound are in the country of the strong clan of the
Macleans, and the people that passed the ferry with me were almost all
of that clan. The skipper of the boat, on the other hand, was called
Neil Roy Macrob; and since Macrob was one of the names of Alan’s
clansmen, and Alan himself had sent me to that ferry, I was eager to
come to private speech of Neil Roy.

In the crowded boat this was of course impossible, and the passage was
a very slow affair. There was no wind, and as the boat was wretchedly
equipped, we could pull but two oars on one side, and one on the other.
The men gave way, however, with a good will, the passengers taking
spells to help them, and the whole company giving the time in
Gaelic boat-songs. And what with the songs, and the sea-air, and the
good-nature and spirit of all concerned, and the bright weather, the
passage was a pretty thing to have seen.

But there was one melancholy part. In the mouth of Loch Aline we found
a great sea-going ship at anchor; and this I supposed at first to be one
of the King’s cruisers which were kept along that coast, both summer
and winter, to prevent communication with the French. As we got a little
nearer, it became plain she was a ship of merchandise; and what still
more puzzled me, not only her decks, but the sea-beach also, were quite
black with people, and skiffs were continually plying to and fro between
them. Yet nearer, and there began to come to our ears a great sound
of mourning, the people on board and those on the shore crying and
lamenting one to another so as to pierce the heart.

Then I understood this was an emigrant ship bound for the American
colonies.

We put the ferry-boat alongside, and the exiles leaned over the
bulwarks, weeping and reaching out their hands to my fellow-passengers,
among whom they counted some near friends. How long this might have gone
on I do not know, for they seemed to have no sense of time: but at last
the captain of the ship, who seemed near beside himself (and no great
wonder) in the midst of this crying and confusion, came to the side and
begged us to depart.

Thereupon Neil sheered off; and the chief singer in our boat struck into
a melancholy air, which was presently taken up both by the emigrants and
their friends upon the beach, so that it sounded from all sides like a
lament for the dying. I saw the tears run down the cheeks of the men and
women in the boat, even as they bent at the oars; and the circumstances
and the music of the song (which is one called “Lochaber no more”) were
highly affecting even to myself.

At Kinlochaline I got Neil Roy upon one side on the beach, and said I
made sure he was one of Appin’s men.

“And what for no?” said he.

“I am seeking somebody,” said I; “and it comes in my mind that you will
have news of him. Alan Breck Stewart is his name.” And very foolishly,
instead of showing him the button, I sought to pass a shilling in his
hand.

At this he drew back. “I am very much affronted,” he said; “and this is
not the way that one shentleman should behave to another at all. The man
you ask for is in France; but if he was in my sporran,” says he, “and
your belly full of shillings, I would not hurt a hair upon his body.”

I saw I had gone the wrong way to work, and without wasting time upon
apologies, showed him the button lying in the hollow of my palm.

“Aweel, aweel,” said Neil; “and I think ye might have begun with that
end of the stick, whatever! But if ye are the lad with the silver
button, all is well, and I have the word to see that ye come safe. But
if ye will pardon me to speak plainly,” says he, “there is a name that
you should never take into your mouth, and that is the name of Alan
Breck; and there is a thing that ye would never do, and that is to offer
your dirty money to a Hieland shentleman.”

It was not very easy to apologise; for I could scarce tell him (what was
the truth) that I had never dreamed he would set up to be a gentleman
until he told me so. Neil on his part had no wish to prolong his
dealings with me, only to fulfil his orders and be done with it; and
he made haste to give me my route. This was to lie the night in
Kinlochaline in the public inn; to cross Morven the next day to Ardgour,
and lie the night in the house of one John of the Claymore, who was
warned that I might come; the third day, to be set across one loch at
Corran and another at Balachulish, and then ask my way to the house of
James of the Glens, at Aucharn in Duror of Appin. There was a good deal
of ferrying, as you hear; the sea in all this part running deep into the
mountains and winding about their roots. It makes the country strong to
hold and difficult to travel, but full of prodigious wild and dreadful
prospects.

I had some other advice from Neil: to speak with no one by the way, to
avoid Whigs, Campbells, and the “red-soldiers;” to leave the road and
lie in a bush if I saw any of the latter coming, “for it was never
chancy to meet in with them;” and in brief, to conduct myself like a
robber or a Jacobite agent, as perhaps Neil thought me.

The inn at Kinlochaline was the most beggarly vile place that ever pigs
were styed in, full of smoke, vermin, and silent Highlanders. I was not
only discontented with my lodging, but with myself for my mismanagement
of Neil, and thought I could hardly be worse off. But very wrongly, as I
was soon to see; for I had not been half an hour at the inn (standing in
the door most of the time, to ease my eyes from the peat smoke) when a
thunderstorm came close by, the springs broke in a little hill on which
the inn stood, and one end of the house became a running water. Places
of public entertainment were bad enough all over Scotland in those days;
yet it was a wonder to myself, when I had to go from the fireside to the
bed in which I slept, wading over the shoes.

Early in my next day’s journey I overtook a little, stout, solemn man,
walking very slowly with his toes turned out, sometimes reading in
a book and sometimes marking the place with his finger, and dressed
decently and plainly in something of a clerical style.

This I found to be another catechist, but of a different order from the
blind man of Mull: being indeed one of those sent out by the Edinburgh
Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, to evangelise the more
savage places of the Highlands. His name was Henderland; he spoke with
the broad south-country tongue, which I was beginning to weary for the
sound of; and besides common countryship, we soon found we had a
more particular bond of interest. For my good friend, the minister of
Essendean, had translated into the Gaelic in his by-time a number of
hymns and pious books which Henderland used in his work, and held in
great esteem. Indeed, it was one of these he was carrying and reading
when we met.

We fell in company at once, our ways lying together as far as to
Kingairloch. As we went, he stopped and spoke with all the wayfarers
and workers that we met or passed; and though of course I could not tell
what they discoursed about, yet I judged Mr. Henderland must be well
liked in the countryside, for I observed many of them to bring out their
mulls and share a pinch of snuff with him.

I told him as far in my affairs as I judged wise; as far, that is,
as they were none of Alan’s; and gave Balachulish as the place I was
travelling to, to meet a friend; for I thought Aucharn, or even Duror,
would be too particular, and might put him on the scent.

On his part, he told me much of his work and the people he worked among,
the hiding priests and Jacobites, the Disarming Act, the dress, and many
other curiosities of the time and place. He seemed moderate; blaming
Parliament in several points, and especially because they had framed the
Act more severely against those who wore the dress than against those
who carried weapons.

This moderation put it in my mind to question him of the Red Fox and the
Appin tenants; questions which, I thought, would seem natural enough in
the mouth of one travelling to that country.



He said it was a bad business. “It’s wonderful,” said he, “where the
tenants find the money, for their life is mere starvation. (Ye don’t
carry such a thing as snuff, do ye, Mr. Balfour? No. Well, I’m better
wanting it.) But these tenants (as I was saying) are doubtless partly
driven to it. James Stewart in Duror (that’s him they call James of the
Glens) is half-brother to Ardshiel, the captain of the clan; and he is
a man much looked up to, and drives very hard. And then there’s one they
call Alan Breck--”

“Ah!” I cried, “what of him?”

“What of the wind that bloweth where it listeth?” said Henderland. “He’s
here and awa; here to-day and gone to-morrow: a fair heather-cat. He
might be glowering at the two of us out of yon whin-bush, and I wouldnae
wonder! Ye’ll no carry such a thing as snuff, will ye?”

I told him no, and that he had asked the same thing more than once.

“It’s highly possible,” said he, sighing. “But it seems strange ye
shouldnae carry it. However, as I was saying, this Alan Breck is a bold,
desperate customer, and well kent to be James’s right hand. His life
is forfeit already; he would boggle at naething; and maybe, if a
tenant-body was to hang back he would get a dirk in his wame.”

“You make a poor story of it all, Mr. Henderland,” said I. “If it is all
fear upon both sides, I care to hear no more of it.”

“Na,” said Mr. Henderland, “but there’s love too, and self-denial that
should put the like of you and me to shame. There’s something fine about
it; no perhaps Christian, but humanly fine. Even Alan Breck, by all that
I hear, is a chield to be respected. There’s many a lying sneck-draw
sits close in kirk in our own part of the country, and stands well in
the world’s eye, and maybe is a far worse man, Mr. Balfour, than yon
misguided shedder of man’s blood. Ay, ay, we might take a lesson by
them.--Ye’ll perhaps think I’ve been too long in the Hielands?” he
added, smiling to me.

I told him not at all; that I had seen much to admire among the
Highlanders; and if he came to that, Mr. Campbell himself was a
Highlander.

“Ay,” said he, “that’s true. It’s a fine blood.”

“And what is the King’s agent about?” I asked.

“Colin Campbell?” says Henderland. “Putting his head in a bees’ byke!”

“He is to turn the tenants out by force, I hear?” said I.

“Yes,” says he, “but the business has gone back and forth, as folk say.
First, James of the Glens rode to Edinburgh, and got some lawyer (a
Stewart, nae doubt--they all hing together like bats in a steeple) and
had the proceedings stayed. And then Colin Campbell cam’ in again, and
had the upper-hand before the Barons of Exchequer. And now they tell me
the first of the tenants are to flit to-morrow. It’s to begin at Duror
under James’s very windows, which doesnae seem wise by my humble way of
it.”

“Do you think they’ll fight?” I asked.

“Well,” says Henderland, “they’re disarmed--or supposed to be--for
there’s still a good deal of cold iron lying by in quiet places. And
then Colin Campbell has the sogers coming. But for all that, if I was
his lady wife, I wouldnae be well pleased till I got him home again.
They’re queer customers, the Appin Stewarts.”

I asked if they were worse than their neighbours.

“No they,” said he. “And that’s the worst part of it. For if Colin Roy
can get his business done in Appin, he has it all to begin again in the
next country, which they call Mamore, and which is one of the countries
of the Camerons. He’s King’s Factor upon both, and from both he has to
drive out the tenants; and indeed, Mr. Balfour (to be open with ye),
it’s my belief that if he escapes the one lot, he’ll get his death by
the other.”

So we continued talking and walking the great part of the day; until
at last, Mr. Henderland after expressing his delight in my company, and
satisfaction at meeting with a friend of Mr. Campbell’s (“whom,” says
he, “I will make bold to call that sweet singer of our covenanted
Zion”), proposed that I should make a short stage, and lie the night in
his house a little beyond Kingairloch. To say truth, I was overjoyed;
for I had no great desire for John of the Claymore, and since my double
misadventure, first with the guide and next with the gentleman skipper,
I stood in some fear of any Highland stranger. Accordingly we shook
hands upon the bargain, and came in the afternoon to a small house,
standing alone by the shore of the Linnhe Loch. The sun was already gone
from the desert mountains of Ardgour upon the hither side, but shone on
those of Appin on the farther; the loch lay as still as a lake, only
the gulls were crying round the sides of it; and the whole place seemed
solemn and uncouth.

We had no sooner come to the door of Mr. Henderland’s dwelling, than to
my great surprise (for I was now used to the politeness of Highlanders)
he burst rudely past me, dashed into the room, caught up a jar and
a small horn-spoon, and began ladling snuff into his nose in most
excessive quantities. Then he had a hearty fit of sneezing, and looked
round upon me with a rather silly smile.

“It’s a vow I took,” says he. “I took a vow upon me that I wouldnae
carry it. Doubtless it’s a great privation; but when I think upon
the martyrs, not only to the Scottish Covenant but to other points of
Christianity, I think shame to mind it.”

As soon as we had eaten (and porridge and whey was the best of the good
man’s diet) he took a grave face and said he had a duty to perform by
Mr. Campbell, and that was to inquire into my state of mind towards God.
I was inclined to smile at him since the business of the snuff; but he
had not spoken long before he brought the tears into my eyes. There are
two things that men should never weary of, goodness and humility; we get
none too much of them in this rough world among cold, proud people; but
Mr. Henderland had their very speech upon his tongue. And though I was a
good deal puffed up with my adventures and with having come off, as the
saying is, with flying colours; yet he soon had me on my knees beside a
simple, poor old man, and both proud and glad to be there.

Before we went to bed he offered me sixpence to help me on my way, out
of a scanty store he kept in the turf wall of his house; at which excess
of goodness I knew not what to do. But at last he was so earnest with me
that I thought it the more mannerly part to let him have his way, and so
left him poorer than myself.




CHAPTER XVII

THE DEATH OF THE RED FOX

The next day Mr. Henderland found for me a man who had a boat of his own
and was to cross the Linnhe Loch that afternoon into Appin, fishing. Him
he prevailed on to take me, for he was one of his flock; and in this way
I saved a long day’s travel and the price of the two public ferries I
must otherwise have passed.

It was near noon before we set out; a dark day with clouds, and the sun
shining upon little patches. The sea was here very deep and still,
and had scarce a wave upon it; so that I must put the water to my lips
before I could believe it to be truly salt. The mountains on either side
were high, rough and barren, very black and gloomy in the shadow of
the clouds, but all silver-laced with little watercourses where the sun
shone upon them. It seemed a hard country, this of Appin, for people to
care as much about as Alan did.

There was but one thing to mention. A little after we had started,
the sun shone upon a little moving clump of scarlet close in along the
water-side to the north. It was much of the same red as soldiers’ coats;
every now and then, too, there came little sparks and lightnings, as
though the sun had struck upon bright steel.

I asked my boatman what it should be, and he answered he supposed it was
some of the red soldiers coming from Fort William into Appin, against
the poor tenantry of the country. Well, it was a sad sight to me;
and whether it was because of my thoughts of Alan, or from something
prophetic in my bosom, although this was but the second time I had seen
King George’s troops, I had no good will to them.

At last we came so near the point of land at the entering in of Loch
Leven that I begged to be set on shore. My boatman (who was an honest
fellow and mindful of his promise to the catechist) would fain have
carried me on to Balachulish; but as this was to take me farther from my
secret destination, I insisted, and was set on shore at last under the
wood of Lettermore (or Lettervore, for I have heard it both ways) in
Alan’s country of Appin.

This was a wood of birches, growing on a steep, craggy side of a
mountain that overhung the loch. It had many openings and ferny howes;
and a road or bridle track ran north and south through the midst of
it, by the edge of which, where was a spring, I sat down to eat some
oat-bread of Mr. Henderland’s and think upon my situation.

Here I was not only troubled by a cloud of stinging midges, but far more
by the doubts of my mind. What I ought to do, why I was going to join
myself with an outlaw and a would-be murderer like Alan, whether I
should not be acting more like a man of sense to tramp back to the south
country direct, by my own guidance and at my own charges, and what Mr.
Campbell or even Mr. Henderland would think of me if they should ever
learn my folly and presumption: these were the doubts that now began to
come in on me stronger than ever.

As I was so sitting and thinking, a sound of men and horses came to me
through the wood; and presently after, at a turning of the road, I saw
four travellers come into view. The way was in this part so rough and
narrow that they came single and led their horses by the reins. The
first was a great, red-headed gentleman, of an imperious and flushed
face, who carried his hat in his hand and fanned himself, for he was in
a breathing heat. The second, by his decent black garb and white wig,
I correctly took to be a lawyer. The third was a servant, and wore some
part of his clothes in tartan, which showed that his master was of a
Highland family, and either an outlaw or else in singular good odour
with the Government, since the wearing of tartan was against the Act. If
I had been better versed in these things, I would have known the tartan
to be of the Argyle (or Campbell) colours. This servant had a good-sized
portmanteau strapped on his horse, and a net of lemons (to brew punch
with) hanging at the saddle-bow; as was often enough the custom with
luxurious travellers in that part of the country.

As for the fourth, who brought up the tail, I had seen his like before,
and knew him at once to be a sheriff’s officer.

I had no sooner seen these people coming than I made up my mind (for no
reason that I can tell) to go through with my adventure; and when the
first came alongside of me, I rose up from the bracken and asked him the
way to Aucharn.

He stopped and looked at me, as I thought, a little oddly; and then,
turning to the lawyer, “Mungo,” said he, “there’s many a man would think
this more of a warning than two pyats. Here am I on my road to Duror on
the job ye ken; and here is a young lad starts up out of the bracken,
and speers if I am on the way to Aucharn.”

“Glenure,” said the other, “this is an ill subject for jesting.”

These two had now drawn close up and were gazing at me, while the two
followers had halted about a stone-cast in the rear.

“And what seek ye in Aucharn?” said Colin Roy Campbell of Glenure, him
they called the Red Fox; for he it was that I had stopped.

“The man that lives there,” said I.

“James of the Glens,” says Glenure, musingly; and then to the lawyer:
“Is he gathering his people, think ye?”

“Anyway,” says the lawyer, “we shall do better to bide where we are, and
let the soldiers rally us.”

“If you are concerned for me,” said I, “I am neither of his people nor
yours, but an honest subject of King George, owing no man and fearing no
man.”

“Why, very well said,” replies the Factor. “But if I may make so bold as
ask, what does this honest man so far from his country? and why does
he come seeking the brother of Ardshiel? I have power here, I must tell
you. I am King’s Factor upon several of these estates, and have twelve
files of soldiers at my back.”

“I have heard a waif word in the country,” said I, a little nettled,
“that you were a hard man to drive.”

He still kept looking at me, as if in doubt.

“Well,” said he, at last, “your tongue is bold; but I am no unfriend to
plainness. If ye had asked me the way to the door of James Stewart on
any other day but this, I would have set ye right and bidden ye God
speed. But to-day--eh, Mungo?” And he turned again to look at the
lawyer.

But just as he turned there came the shot of a firelock from higher up
the hill; and with the very sound of it Glenure fell upon the road.

“O, I am dead!” he cried, several times over.

The lawyer had caught him up and held him in his arms, the servant
standing over and clasping his hands. And now the wounded man looked
from one to another with scared eyes, and there was a change in his
voice, that went to the heart.

“Take care of yourselves,” says he. “I am dead.”

He tried to open his clothes as if to look for the wound, but his
fingers slipped on the buttons. With that he gave a great sigh, his head
rolled on his shoulder, and he passed away.

The lawyer said never a word, but his face was as sharp as a pen and
as white as the dead man’s; the servant broke out into a great noise of
crying and weeping, like a child; and I, on my side, stood staring at
them in a kind of horror. The sheriff’s officer had run back at the
first sound of the shot, to hasten the coming of the soldiers.

At last the lawyer laid down the dead man in his blood upon the road,
and got to his own feet with a kind of stagger.

I believe it was his movement that brought me to my senses; for he had
no sooner done so than I began to scramble up the hill, crying out, “The
murderer! the murderer!”

So little a time had elapsed, that when I got to the top of the first
steepness, and could see some part of the open mountain, the murderer
was still moving away at no great distance. He was a big man, in a black
coat, with metal buttons, and carried a long fowling-piece.

“Here!” I cried. “I see him!”

At that the murderer gave a little, quick look over his shoulder, and
began to run. The next moment he was lost in a fringe of birches; then
he came out again on the upper side, where I could see him climbing like
a jackanapes, for that part was again very steep; and then he dipped
behind a shoulder, and I saw him no more.

All this time I had been running on my side, and had got a good way up,
when a voice cried upon me to stand.

I was at the edge of the upper wood, and so now, when I halted and
looked back, I saw all the open part of the hill below me.

The lawyer and the sheriff’s officer were standing just above the road,
crying and waving on me to come back; and on their left, the red-coats,
musket in hand, were beginning to struggle singly out of the lower wood.

“Why should I come back?” I cried. “Come you on!”

“Ten pounds if ye take that lad!” cried the lawyer. “He’s an accomplice.
He was posted here to hold us in talk.”

At that word (which I could hear quite plainly, though it was to the
soldiers and not to me that he was crying it) my heart came in my mouth
with quite a new kind of terror. Indeed, it is one thing to stand the
danger of your life, and quite another to run the peril of both life and
character. The thing, besides, had come so suddenly, like thunder out of
a clear sky, that I was all amazed and helpless.

The soldiers began to spread, some of them to run, and others to put up
their pieces and cover me; and still I stood.

“Jock* in here among the trees,” said a voice close by.

     * Duck.

Indeed, I scarce knew what I was doing, but I obeyed; and as I did so, I
heard the firelocks bang and the balls whistle in the birches.

Just inside the shelter of the trees I found Alan Breck standing, with
a fishing-rod. He gave me no salutation; indeed it was no time for
civilities; only “Come!” says he, and set off running along the side of
the mountain towards Balachulish; and I, like a sheep, to follow him.

Now we ran among the birches; now stooping behind low humps upon the
mountain-side; now crawling on all fours among the heather. The pace was
deadly: my heart seemed bursting against my ribs; and I had neither time
to think nor breath to speak with. Only I remember seeing with wonder,
that Alan every now and then would straighten himself to his full height
and look back; and every time he did so, there came a great far-away
cheering and crying of the soldiers.

Quarter of an hour later, Alan stopped, clapped down flat in the
heather, and turned to me.

“Now,” said he, “it’s earnest. Do as I do, for your life.”

And at the same speed, but now with infinitely more precaution, we
traced back again across the mountain-side by the same way that we had
come, only perhaps higher; till at last Alan threw himself down in the
upper wood of Lettermore, where I had found him at the first, and lay,
with his face in the bracken, panting like a dog.

My own sides so ached, my head so swam, my tongue so hung out of my
mouth with heat and dryness, that I lay beside him like one dead.




CHAPTER XVIII

I TALK WITH ALAN IN THE WOOD OF LETTERMORE

Alan was the first to come round. He rose, went to the border of the
wood, peered out a little, and then returned and sat down.

“Well,” said he, “yon was a hot burst, David.”

I said nothing, nor so much as lifted my face. I had seen murder done,
and a great, ruddy, jovial gentleman struck out of life in a moment; the
pity of that sight was still sore within me, and yet that was but a part
of my concern. Here was murder done upon the man Alan hated; here was
Alan skulking in the trees and running from the troops; and whether his
was the hand that fired or only the head that ordered, signified
but little. By my way of it, my only friend in that wild country was
blood-guilty in the first degree; I held him in horror; I could not look
upon his face; I would have rather lain alone in the rain on my cold
isle, than in that warm wood beside a murderer.

“Are ye still wearied?” he asked again.

“No,” said I, still with my face in the bracken; “no, I am not wearied
now, and I can speak. You and me must twine,” * I said. “I liked you very
well, Alan, but your ways are not mine, and they’re not God’s: and the
short and the long of it is just that we must twine.”

     * Part.

“I will hardly twine from ye, David, without some kind of reason for
the same,” said Alan, mighty gravely. “If ye ken anything against
my reputation, it’s the least thing that ye should do, for old
acquaintance’ sake, to let me hear the name of it; and if ye have only
taken a distaste to my society, it will be proper for me to judge if I’m
insulted.”

“Alan,” said I, “what is the sense of this? Ye ken very well yon
Campbell-man lies in his blood upon the road.”

He was silent for a little; then says he, “Did ever ye hear tell of the
story of the Man and the Good People?”--by which he meant the fairies.

“No,” said I, “nor do I want to hear it.”

“With your permission, Mr. Balfour, I will tell it you, whatever,” says
Alan. “The man, ye should ken, was cast upon a rock in the sea, where
it appears the Good People were in use to come and rest as they went
through to Ireland. The name of this rock is called the Skerryvore, and
it’s not far from where we suffered ship-wreck. Well, it seems the man
cried so sore, if he could just see his little bairn before he died!
that at last the king of the Good People took peety upon him, and sent
one flying that brought back the bairn in a poke* and laid it down
beside the man where he lay sleeping. So when the man woke, there was a
poke beside him and something into the inside of it that moved. Well, it
seems he was one of these gentry that think aye the worst of things; and
for greater security, he stuck his dirk throughout that poke before he
opened it, and there was his bairn dead. I am thinking to myself, Mr.
Balfour, that you and the man are very much alike.”

     * Bag.

“Do you mean you had no hand in it?” cried I, sitting up.

“I will tell you first of all, Mr. Balfour of Shaws, as one friend to
another,” said Alan, “that if I were going to kill a gentleman, it would
not be in my own country, to bring trouble on my clan; and I would not
go wanting sword and gun, and with a long fishing-rod upon my back.”

“Well,” said I, “that’s true!”

“And now,” continued Alan, taking out his dirk and laying his hand upon
it in a certain manner, “I swear upon the Holy Iron I had neither art
nor part, act nor thought in it.”

“I thank God for that!” cried I, and offered him my hand.

He did not appear to see it.

“And here is a great deal of work about a Campbell!” said he. “They are
not so scarce, that I ken!”

“At least,” said I, “you cannot justly blame me, for you know very
well what you told me in the brig. But the temptation and the act are
different, I thank God again for that. We may all be tempted; but
to take a life in cold blood, Alan!” And I could say no more for the
moment. “And do you know who did it?” I added. “Do you know that man in
the black coat?”

“I have nae clear mind about his coat,” said Alan cunningly, “but it
sticks in my head that it was blue.”

“Blue or black, did ye know him?” said I.

“I couldnae just conscientiously swear to him,” says Alan. “He gaed very
close by me, to be sure, but it’s a strange thing that I should just
have been tying my brogues.”

“Can you swear that you don’t know him, Alan?” I cried, half angered,
half in a mind to laugh at his evasions.

“Not yet,” says he; “but I’ve a grand memory for forgetting, David.”

“And yet there was one thing I saw clearly,” said I; “and that was, that
you exposed yourself and me to draw the soldiers.”

“It’s very likely,” said Alan; “and so would any gentleman. You and me
were innocent of that transaction.”

“The better reason, since we were falsely suspected, that we should get
clear,” I cried. “The innocent should surely come before the guilty.”

“Why, David,” said he, “the innocent have aye a chance to get assoiled
in court; but for the lad that shot the bullet, I think the best place
for him will be the heather. Them that havenae dipped their hands in any
little difficulty, should be very mindful of the case of them that have.
And that is the good Christianity. For if it was the other way round
about, and the lad whom I couldnae just clearly see had been in our
shoes, and we in his (as might very well have been), I think we would be
a good deal obliged to him oursel’s if he would draw the soldiers.”

When it came to this, I gave Alan up. But he looked so innocent all the
time, and was in such clear good faith in what he said, and so ready to
sacrifice himself for what he deemed his duty, that my mouth was closed.
Mr. Henderland’s words came back to me: that we ourselves might take a
lesson by these wild Highlanders. Well, here I had taken mine. Alan’s
morals were all tail-first; but he was ready to give his life for them,
such as they were.

“Alan,” said I, “I’ll not say it’s the good Christianity as I understand
it, but it’s good enough. And here I offer ye my hand for the second
time.”

Whereupon he gave me both of his, saying surely I had cast a spell upon
him, for he could forgive me anything. Then he grew very grave, and said
we had not much time to throw away, but must both flee that country: he,
because he was a deserter, and the whole of Appin would now be searched
like a chamber, and every one obliged to give a good account of himself;
and I, because I was certainly involved in the murder.

“O!” says I, willing to give him a little lesson, “I have no fear of the
justice of my country.”

“As if this was your country!” said he. “Or as if ye would be tried
here, in a country of Stewarts!”

“It’s all Scotland,” said I.

“Man, I whiles wonder at ye,” said Alan. “This is a Campbell that’s been
killed. Well, it’ll be tried in Inverara, the Campbells’ head place;
with fifteen Campbells in the jury-box and the biggest Campbell of all
(and that’s the Duke) sitting cocking on the bench. Justice, David?
The same justice, by all the world, as Glenure found awhile ago at the
roadside.”

This frightened me a little, I confess, and would have frightened me
more if I had known how nearly exact were Alan’s predictions; indeed
it was but in one point that he exaggerated, there being but eleven
Campbells on the jury; though as the other four were equally in the
Duke’s dependence, it mattered less than might appear. Still, I cried
out that he was unjust to the Duke of Argyle, who (for all he was a
Whig) was yet a wise and honest nobleman.

“Hoot!” said Alan, “the man’s a Whig, nae doubt; but I would never deny
he was a good chieftain to his clan. And what would the clan think if
there was a Campbell shot, and naebody hanged, and their own chief
the Justice General? But I have often observed,” says Alan, “that you
Low-country bodies have no clear idea of what’s right and wrong.”

At this I did at last laugh out aloud, when to my surprise, Alan joined
in, and laughed as merrily as myself.

“Na, na,” said he, “we’re in the Hielands, David; and when I tell ye
to run, take my word and run. Nae doubt it’s a hard thing to skulk and
starve in the Heather, but it’s harder yet to lie shackled in a red-coat
prison.”

I asked him whither we should flee; and as he told me “to the Lowlands,”
 I was a little better inclined to go with him; for, indeed, I was
growing impatient to get back and have the upper-hand of my uncle.
Besides, Alan made so sure there would be no question of justice in the
matter, that I began to be afraid he might be right. Of all deaths, I
would truly like least to die by the gallows; and the picture of that
uncanny instrument came into my head with extraordinary clearness (as I
had once seen it engraved at the top of a pedlar’s ballad) and took away
my appetite for courts of justice.

“I’ll chance it, Alan,” said I. “I’ll go with you.”

“But mind you,” said Alan, “it’s no small thing. Ye maun lie bare and
hard, and brook many an empty belly. Your bed shall be the moorcock’s,
and your life shall be like the hunted deer’s, and ye shall sleep with
your hand upon your weapons. Ay, man, ye shall taigle many a weary foot,
or we get clear! I tell ye this at the start, for it’s a life that I ken
well. But if ye ask what other chance ye have, I answer: Nane. Either
take to the heather with me, or else hang.”

“And that’s a choice very easily made,” said I; and we shook hands upon
it.

“And now let’s take another keek at the red-coats,” says Alan, and he
led me to the north-eastern fringe of the wood.

Looking out between the trees, we could see a great side of mountain,
running down exceeding steep into the waters of the loch. It was a rough
part, all hanging stone, and heather, and big scrogs of birchwood; and
away at the far end towards Balachulish, little wee red soldiers were
dipping up and down over hill and howe, and growing smaller every
minute. There was no cheering now, for I think they had other uses
for what breath was left them; but they still stuck to the trail, and
doubtless thought that we were close in front of them.

Alan watched them, smiling to himself.

“Ay,” said he, “they’ll be gey weary before they’ve got to the end of
that employ! And so you and me, David, can sit down and eat a bite, and
breathe a bit longer, and take a dram from my bottle. Then we’ll strike
for Aucharn, the house of my kinsman, James of the Glens, where I must
get my clothes, and my arms, and money to carry us along; and then,
David, we’ll cry, ‘Forth, Fortune!’ and take a cast among the heather.”

So we sat again and ate and drank, in a place whence we could see the
sun going down into a field of great, wild, and houseless mountains,
such as I was now condemned to wander in with my companion. Partly as
we so sat, and partly afterwards, on the way to Aucharn, each of us
narrated his adventures; and I shall here set down so much of Alan’s as
seems either curious or needful.

It appears he ran to the bulwarks as soon as the wave was passed; saw
me, and lost me, and saw me again, as I tumbled in the roost; and at
last had one glimpse of me clinging on the yard. It was this that put
him in some hope I would maybe get to land after all, and made him leave
those clues and messages which had brought me (for my sins) to that
unlucky country of Appin.

In the meanwhile, those still on the brig had got the skiff launched,
and one or two were on board of her already, when there came a second
wave greater than the first, and heaved the brig out of her place, and
would certainly have sent her to the bottom, had she not struck and
caught on some projection of the reef. When she had struck first, it had
been bows-on, so that the stern had hitherto been lowest. But now her
stern was thrown in the air, and the bows plunged under the sea; and
with that, the water began to pour into the fore-scuttle like the
pouring of a mill-dam.

It took the colour out of Alan’s face, even to tell what followed.
For there were still two men lying impotent in their bunks; and these,
seeing the water pour in and thinking the ship had foundered, began to
cry out aloud, and that with such harrowing cries that all who were on
deck tumbled one after another into the skiff and fell to their oars.
They were not two hundred yards away, when there came a third great sea;
and at that the brig lifted clean over the reef; her canvas filled for
a moment, and she seemed to sail in chase of them, but settling all the
while; and presently she drew down and down, as if a hand was drawing
her; and the sea closed over the Covenant of Dysart.

Never a word they spoke as they pulled ashore, being stunned with the
horror of that screaming; but they had scarce set foot upon the beach
when Hoseason woke up, as if out of a muse, and bade them lay hands upon
Alan. They hung back indeed, having little taste for the employment;
but Hoseason was like a fiend, crying that Alan was alone, that he had
a great sum about him, that he had been the means of losing the brig and
drowning all their comrades, and that here was both revenge and wealth
upon a single cast. It was seven against one; in that part of the shore
there was no rock that Alan could set his back to; and the sailors began
to spread out and come behind him.

“And then,” said Alan, “the little man with the red head--I havenae mind
of the name that he is called.”

“Riach,” said I.

“Ay” said Alan, “Riach! Well, it was him that took up the clubs for me,
asked the men if they werenae feared of a judgment, and, says he ‘Dod,
I’ll put my back to the Hielandman’s mysel’.’ That’s none such an
entirely bad little man, yon little man with the red head,” said Alan.
“He has some spunks of decency.”

“Well,” said I, “he was kind to me in his way.”

“And so he was to Alan,” said he; “and by my troth, I found his way a
very good one! But ye see, David, the loss of the ship and the cries of
these poor lads sat very ill upon the man; and I’m thinking that would
be the cause of it.”

“Well, I would think so,” says I; “for he was as keen as any of the rest
at the beginning. But how did Hoseason take it?”

“It sticks in my mind that he would take it very ill,” says Alan. “But
the little man cried to me to run, and indeed I thought it was a good
observe, and ran. The last that I saw they were all in a knot upon the
beach, like folk that were not agreeing very well together.”

“What do you mean by that?” said I.

“Well, the fists were going,” said Alan; “and I saw one man go down like
a pair of breeks. But I thought it would be better no to wait. Ye see
there’s a strip of Campbells in that end of Mull, which is no good
company for a gentleman like me. If it hadnae been for that I would have
waited and looked for ye mysel’, let alone giving a hand to the little
man.” (It was droll how Alan dwelt on Mr. Riach’s stature, for, to say
the truth, the one was not much smaller than the other.) “So,” says he,
continuing, “I set my best foot forward, and whenever I met in with any
one I cried out there was a wreck ashore. Man, they didnae stop to fash
with me! Ye should have seen them linking for the beach! And when they
got there they found they had had the pleasure of a run, which is aye
good for a Campbell. I’m thinking it was a judgment on the clan that the
brig went down in the lump and didnae break. But it was a very unlucky
thing for you, that same; for if any wreck had come ashore they would
have hunted high and low, and would soon have found ye.”




CHAPTER XIX

THE HOUSE OF FEAR

Night fell as we were walking, and the clouds, which had broken up in
the afternoon, settled in and thickened, so that it fell, for the
season of the year, extremely dark. The way we went was over rough
mountainsides; and though Alan pushed on with an assured manner, I could
by no means see how he directed himself.

At last, about half-past ten of the clock, we came to the top of a brae,
and saw lights below us. It seemed a house door stood open and let out a
beam of fire and candle-light; and all round the house and steading
five or six persons were moving hurriedly about, each carrying a lighted
brand.

“James must have tint his wits,” said Alan. “If this was the soldiers
instead of you and me, he would be in a bonny mess. But I dare say he’ll
have a sentry on the road, and he would ken well enough no soldiers
would find the way that we came.”

Hereupon he whistled three times, in a particular manner. It was strange
to see how, at the first sound of it, all the moving torches came to
a stand, as if the bearers were affrighted; and how, at the third, the
bustle began again as before.

Having thus set folks’ minds at rest, we came down the brae, and were
met at the yard gate (for this place was like a well-doing farm) by
a tall, handsome man of more than fifty, who cried out to Alan in the
Gaelic.

“James Stewart,” said Alan, “I will ask ye to speak in Scotch, for here
is a young gentleman with me that has nane of the other. This is him,”
 he added, putting his arm through mine, “a young gentleman of the
Lowlands, and a laird in his country too, but I am thinking it will be
the better for his health if we give his name the go-by.”

James of the Glens turned to me for a moment, and greeted me courteously
enough; the next he had turned to Alan.

“This has been a dreadful accident,” he cried. “It will bring trouble on
the country.” And he wrung his hands.

“Hoots!” said Alan, “ye must take the sour with the sweet, man. Colin
Roy is dead, and be thankful for that!”

“Ay” said James, “and by my troth, I wish he was alive again! It’s all
very fine to blow and boast beforehand; but now it’s done, Alan; and
who’s to bear the wyte* of it? The accident fell out in Appin--mind ye
that, Alan; it’s Appin that must pay; and I am a man that has a family.”

     * Blame.

While this was going on I looked about me at the servants. Some were on
ladders, digging in the thatch of the house or the farm buildings,
from which they brought out guns, swords, and different weapons of
war; others carried them away; and by the sound of mattock blows from
somewhere farther down the brae, I suppose they buried them. Though they
were all so busy, there prevailed no kind of order in their efforts; men
struggled together for the same gun and ran into each other with their
burning torches; and James was continually turning about from his talk
with Alan, to cry out orders which were apparently never understood. The
faces in the torchlight were like those of people overborne with hurry
and panic; and though none spoke above his breath, their speech sounded
both anxious and angry.

It was about this time that a lassie came out of the house carrying
a pack or bundle; and it has often made me smile to think how Alan’s
instinct awoke at the mere sight of it.

“What’s that the lassie has?” he asked.

“We’re just setting the house in order, Alan,” said James, in his
frightened and somewhat fawning way. “They’ll search Appin with candles,
and we must have all things straight. We’re digging the bit guns and
swords into the moss, ye see; and these, I am thinking, will be your ain
French clothes. We’ll be to bury them, I believe.”

“Bury my French clothes!” cried Alan. “Troth, no!” And he laid hold upon
the packet and retired into the barn to shift himself, recommending me
in the meanwhile to his kinsman.

James carried me accordingly into the kitchen, and sat down with me at
table, smiling and talking at first in a very hospitable manner. But
presently the gloom returned upon him; he sat frowning and biting his
fingers; only remembered me from time to time; and then gave me but a
word or two and a poor smile, and back into his private terrors. His
wife sat by the fire and wept, with her face in her hands; his eldest
son was crouched upon the floor, running over a great mass of papers and
now and again setting one alight and burning it to the bitter end; all
the while a servant lass with a red face was rummaging about the room,
in a blind hurry of fear, and whimpering as she went; and every now and
again one of the men would thrust in his face from the yard, and cry for
orders.

At last James could keep his seat no longer, and begged my permission to
be so unmannerly as walk about. “I am but poor company altogether, sir,”
 says he, “but I can think of nothing but this dreadful accident, and the
trouble it is like to bring upon quite innocent persons.”

A little after he observed his son burning a paper which he thought
should have been kept; and at that his excitement burst out so that it
was painful to witness. He struck the lad repeatedly.

“Are you gone gyte?” * he cried. “Do you wish to hang your father?” and
forgetful of my presence, carried on at him a long time together in the
Gaelic, the young man answering nothing; only the wife, at the name of
hanging, throwing her apron over her face and sobbing out louder than
before.

     * Mad.

This was all wretched for a stranger like myself to hear and see; and
I was right glad when Alan returned, looking like himself in his fine
French clothes, though (to be sure) they were now grown almost too
battered and withered to deserve the name of fine. I was then taken out
in my turn by another of the sons, and given that change of clothing of
which I had stood so long in need, and a pair of Highland brogues made
of deer-leather, rather strange at first, but after a little practice
very easy to the feet.

By the time I came back Alan must have told his story; for it seemed
understood that I was to fly with him, and they were all busy upon our
equipment. They gave us each a sword and pistols, though I professed my
inability to use the former; and with these, and some ammunition, a bag
of oatmeal, an iron pan, and a bottle of right French brandy, we were
ready for the heather. Money, indeed, was lacking. I had about two
guineas left; Alan’s belt having been despatched by another hand, that
trusty messenger had no more than seventeen-pence to his whole fortune;
and as for James, it appears he had brought himself so low with journeys
to Edinburgh and legal expenses on behalf of the tenants, that he could
only scrape together three-and-five-pence-halfpenny, the most of it in
coppers.

“This’ll no do,” said Alan.

“Ye must find a safe bit somewhere near by,” said James, “and get word
sent to me. Ye see, ye’ll have to get this business prettily off, Alan.
This is no time to be stayed for a guinea or two. They’re sure to get
wind of ye, sure to seek ye, and by my way of it, sure to lay on ye the
wyte of this day’s accident. If it falls on you, it falls on me that am
your near kinsman and harboured ye while ye were in the country. And if
it comes on me----” he paused, and bit his fingers, with a white face.
“It would be a painful thing for our friends if I was to hang,” said he.

“It would be an ill day for Appin,” says Alan.

“It’s a day that sticks in my throat,” said James. “O man, man, man--man
Alan! you and me have spoken like two fools!” he cried, striking his
hand upon the wall so that the house rang again.

“Well, and that’s true, too,” said Alan; “and my friend from the
Lowlands here” (nodding at me) “gave me a good word upon that head, if I
would only have listened to him.”

“But see here,” said James, returning to his former manner, “if they lay
me by the heels, Alan, it’s then that you’ll be needing the money. For
with all that I have said and that you have said, it will look very
black against the two of us; do ye mark that? Well, follow me out, and
ye’ll, I’ll see that I’ll have to get a paper out against ye mysel’;
have to offer a reward for ye; ay, will I! It’s a sore thing to do
between such near friends; but if I get the dirdum* of this dreadful
accident, I’ll have to fend for myself, man. Do ye see that?”

     * Blame.

He spoke with a pleading earnestness, taking Alan by the breast of the
coat.

“Ay” said Alan, “I see that.”

“And ye’ll have to be clear of the country, Alan--ay, and clear of
Scotland--you and your friend from the Lowlands, too. For I’ll have to
paper your friend from the Lowlands. Ye see that, Alan--say that ye see
that!”

I thought Alan flushed a bit. “This is unco hard on me that brought him
here, James,” said he, throwing his head back. “It’s like making me a
traitor!”

“Now, Alan, man!” cried James. “Look things in the face! He’ll be
papered anyway; Mungo Campbell’ll be sure to paper him; what matters
if I paper him too? And then, Alan, I am a man that has a family.” And
then, after a little pause on both sides, “And, Alan, it’ll be a jury of
Campbells,” said he.

“There’s one thing,” said Alan, musingly, “that naebody kens his name.”

“Nor yet they shallnae, Alan! There’s my hand on that,” cried James, for
all the world as if he had really known my name and was foregoing some
advantage. “But just the habit he was in, and what he looked like, and
his age, and the like? I couldnae well do less.”

“I wonder at your father’s son,” cried Alan, sternly. “Would ye sell the
lad with a gift? Would ye change his clothes and then betray him?”

“No, no, Alan,” said James. “No, no: the habit he took off--the habit
Mungo saw him in.” But I thought he seemed crestfallen; indeed, he was
clutching at every straw, and all the time, I dare say, saw the faces of
his hereditary foes on the bench, and in the jury-box, and the gallows
in the background.

“Well, sir,” says Alan, turning to me, “what say ye to that? Ye are here
under the safeguard of my honour; and it’s my part to see nothing done
but what shall please you.”

“I have but one word to say,” said I; “for to all this dispute I am a
perfect stranger. But the plain common-sense is to set the blame where
it belongs, and that is on the man who fired the shot. Paper him, as ye
call it, set the hunt on him; and let honest, innocent folk show their
faces in safety.” But at this both Alan and James cried out in horror;
bidding me hold my tongue, for that was not to be thought of; and asking
me what the Camerons would think? (which confirmed me, it must have been
a Cameron from Mamore that did the act) and if I did not see that the
lad might be caught? “Ye havenae surely thought of that?” said they,
with such innocent earnestness, that my hands dropped at my side and I
despaired of argument.

“Very well, then,” said I, “paper me, if you please, paper Alan, paper
King George! We’re all three innocent, and that seems to be what’s
wanted. But at least, sir,” said I to James, recovering from my little
fit of annoyance, “I am Alan’s friend, and if I can be helpful to
friends of his, I will not stumble at the risk.”

I thought it best to put a fair face on my consent, for I saw Alan
troubled; and, besides (thinks I to myself), as soon as my back is
turned, they will paper me, as they call it, whether I consent or not.
But in this I saw I was wrong; for I had no sooner said the words, than
Mrs. Stewart leaped out of her chair, came running over to us, and wept
first upon my neck and then on Alan’s, blessing God for our goodness to
her family.

“As for you, Alan, it was no more than your bounden duty,” she said.
“But for this lad that has come here and seen us at our worst, and seen
the goodman fleeching like a suitor, him that by rights should give his
commands like any king--as for you, my lad,” she says, “my heart is wae
not to have your name, but I have your face; and as long as my heart
beats under my bosom, I will keep it, and think of it, and bless it.”
 And with that she kissed me, and burst once more into such sobbing, that
I stood abashed.

“Hoot, hoot,” said Alan, looking mighty silly. “The day comes unco soon
in this month of July; and to-morrow there’ll be a fine to-do in Appin,
a fine riding of dragoons, and crying of ‘Cruachan!’ * and running of
red-coats; and it behoves you and me to the sooner be gone.”

     * The rallying-word of the Campbells.

Thereupon we said farewell, and set out again, bending somewhat
eastwards, in a fine mild dark night, and over much the same broken
country as before.




CHAPTER XX

THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER: THE ROCKS

Sometimes we walked, sometimes ran; and as it drew on to morning, walked
ever the less and ran the more. Though, upon its face, that country
appeared to be a desert, yet there were huts and houses of the people,
of which we must have passed more than twenty, hidden in quiet places of
the hills. When we came to one of these, Alan would leave me in the way,
and go himself and rap upon the side of the house and speak awhile at
the window with some sleeper awakened. This was to pass the news; which,
in that country, was so much of a duty that Alan must pause to attend to
it even while fleeing for his life; and so well attended to by others,
that in more than half of the houses where we called they had heard
already of the murder. In the others, as well as I could make out
(standing back at a distance and hearing a strange tongue), the news was
received with more of consternation than surprise.

For all our hurry, day began to come in while we were still far from any
shelter. It found us in a prodigious valley, strewn with rocks and where
ran a foaming river. Wild mountains stood around it; there grew there
neither grass nor trees; and I have sometimes thought since then, that
it may have been the valley called Glencoe, where the massacre was in
the time of King William. But for the details of our itinerary, I am all
to seek; our way lying now by short cuts, now by great detours; our pace
being so hurried, our time of journeying usually by night; and the names
of such places as I asked and heard being in the Gaelic tongue and the
more easily forgotten.

The first peep of morning, then, showed us this horrible place, and I
could see Alan knit his brow.

“This is no fit place for you and me,” he said. “This is a place they’re
bound to watch.”

And with that he ran harder than ever down to the water-side, in a part
where the river was split in two among three rocks. It went through with
a horrid thundering that made my belly quake; and there hung over the
lynn a little mist of spray. Alan looked neither to the right nor to the
left, but jumped clean upon the middle rock and fell there on his hands
and knees to check himself, for that rock was small and he might have
pitched over on the far side. I had scarce time to measure the distance
or to understand the peril before I had followed him, and he had caught
and stopped me.

So there we stood, side by side upon a small rock slippery with spray,
a far broader leap in front of us, and the river dinning upon all sides.
When I saw where I was, there came on me a deadly sickness of fear,
and I put my hand over my eyes. Alan took me and shook me; I saw he
was speaking, but the roaring of the falls and the trouble of my mind
prevented me from hearing; only I saw his face was red with anger, and
that he stamped upon the rock. The same look showed me the water raging
by, and the mist hanging in the air: and with that I covered my eyes
again and shuddered.

The next minute Alan had set the brandy bottle to my lips, and forced
me to drink about a gill, which sent the blood into my head again. Then,
putting his hands to his mouth, and his mouth to my ear, he shouted,
“Hang or drown!” and turning his back upon me, leaped over the farther
branch of the stream, and landed safe.

I was now alone upon the rock, which gave me the more room; the brandy
was singing in my ears; I had this good example fresh before me, and
just wit enough to see that if I did not leap at once, I should never
leap at all. I bent low on my knees and flung myself forth, with
that kind of anger of despair that has sometimes stood me in stead of
courage. Sure enough, it was but my hands that reached the full length;
these slipped, caught again, slipped again; and I was sliddering back
into the lynn, when Alan seized me, first by the hair, then by the
collar, and with a great strain dragged me into safety.

Never a word he said, but set off running again for his life, and I must
stagger to my feet and run after him. I had been weary before, but now
I was sick and bruised, and partly drunken with the brandy; I kept
stumbling as I ran, I had a stitch that came near to overmaster me; and
when at last Alan paused under a great rock that stood there among a
number of others, it was none too soon for David Balfour.

A great rock I have said; but by rights it was two rocks leaning
together at the top, both some twenty feet high, and at the first sight
inaccessible. Even Alan (though you may say he had as good as four
hands) failed twice in an attempt to climb them; and it was only at the
third trial, and then by standing on my shoulders and leaping up with
such force as I thought must have broken my collar-bone, that he secured
a lodgment. Once there, he let down his leathern girdle; and with the
aid of that and a pair of shallow footholds in the rock, I scrambled up
beside him.

Then I saw why we had come there; for the two rocks, being both somewhat
hollow on the top and sloping one to the other, made a kind of dish or
saucer, where as many as three or four men might have lain hidden.

All this while Alan had not said a word, and had run and climbed with
such a savage, silent frenzy of hurry, that I knew that he was in mortal
fear of some miscarriage. Even now we were on the rock he said nothing,
nor so much as relaxed the frowning look upon his face; but clapped flat
down, and keeping only one eye above the edge of our place of shelter
scouted all round the compass. The dawn had come quite clear; we could
see the stony sides of the valley, and its bottom, which was bestrewed
with rocks, and the river, which went from one side to another, and made
white falls; but nowhere the smoke of a house, nor any living creature
but some eagles screaming round a cliff.

Then at last Alan smiled.

“Ay” said he, “now we have a chance;” and then looking at me with some
amusement, “Ye’re no very gleg* at the jumping,” said he.

     * Brisk.

At this I suppose I coloured with mortification, for he added at once,
“Hoots! small blame to ye! To be feared of a thing and yet to do it, is
what makes the prettiest kind of a man. And then there was water there,
and water’s a thing that dauntons even me. No, no,” said Alan, “it’s no
you that’s to blame, it’s me.”

I asked him why.

“Why,” said he, “I have proved myself a gomeral this night. For first
of all I take a wrong road, and that in my own country of Appin; so that
the day has caught us where we should never have been; and thanks to
that, we lie here in some danger and mair discomfort. And next (which is
the worst of the two, for a man that has been so much among the heather
as myself) I have come wanting a water-bottle, and here we lie for a
long summer’s day with naething but neat spirit. Ye may think that a
small matter; but before it comes night, David, ye’ll give me news of
it.”

I was anxious to redeem my character, and offered, if he would pour out
the brandy, to run down and fill the bottle at the river.

“I wouldnae waste the good spirit either,” says he. “It’s been a good
friend to you this night; or in my poor opinion, ye would still be
cocking on yon stone. And what’s mair,” says he, “ye may have observed
(you that’s a man of so much penetration) that Alan Breck Stewart was
perhaps walking quicker than his ordinar’.”

“You!” I cried, “you were running fit to burst.”

“Was I so?” said he. “Well, then, ye may depend upon it, there was nae
time to be lost. And now here is enough said; gang you to your sleep,
lad, and I’ll watch.”

Accordingly, I lay down to sleep; a little peaty earth had drifted in
between the top of the two rocks, and some bracken grew there, to be a
bed to me; the last thing I heard was still the crying of the eagles.

I dare say it would be nine in the morning when I was roughly awakened,
and found Alan’s hand pressed upon my mouth.

“Wheesht!” he whispered. “Ye were snoring.”

“Well,” said I, surprised at his anxious and dark face, “and why not?”

He peered over the edge of the rock, and signed to me to do the like.

It was now high day, cloudless, and very hot. The valley was as clear as
in a picture. About half a mile up the water was a camp of red-coats; a
big fire blazed in their midst, at which some were cooking; and near by,
on the top of a rock about as high as ours, there stood a sentry, with
the sun sparkling on his arms. All the way down along the river-side
were posted other sentries; here near together, there widelier
scattered; some planted like the first, on places of command, some
on the ground level and marching and counter-marching, so as to meet
half-way. Higher up the glen, where the ground was more open, the chain
of posts was continued by horse-soldiers, whom we could see in the
distance riding to and fro. Lower down, the infantry continued; but
as the stream was suddenly swelled by the confluence of a considerable
burn, they were more widely set, and only watched the fords and
stepping-stones.

I took but one look at them, and ducked again into my place. It was
strange indeed to see this valley, which had lain so solitary in the
hour of dawn, bristling with arms and dotted with the red coats and
breeches.

“Ye see,” said Alan, “this was what I was afraid of, Davie: that they
would watch the burn-side. They began to come in about two hours ago,
and, man! but ye’re a grand hand at the sleeping! We’re in a narrow
place. If they get up the sides of the hill, they could easy spy us with
a glass; but if they’ll only keep in the foot of the valley, we’ll do
yet. The posts are thinner down the water; and, come night, we’ll try
our hand at getting by them.”

“And what are we to do till night?” I asked.

“Lie here,” says he, “and birstle.”

That one good Scotch word, “birstle,” was indeed the most of the story
of the day that we had now to pass. You are to remember that we lay on
the bare top of a rock, like scones upon a girdle; the sun beat upon us
cruelly; the rock grew so heated, a man could scarce endure the touch of
it; and the little patch of earth and fern, which kept cooler, was only
large enough for one at a time. We took turn about to lie on the naked
rock, which was indeed like the position of that saint that was martyred
on a gridiron; and it ran in my mind how strange it was, that in the
same climate and at only a few days’ distance, I should have suffered
so cruelly, first from cold upon my island and now from heat upon this
rock.

All the while we had no water, only raw brandy for a drink, which was
worse than nothing; but we kept the bottle as cool as we could, burying
it in the earth, and got some relief by bathing our breasts and temples.

The soldiers kept stirring all day in the bottom of the valley, now
changing guard, now in patrolling parties hunting among the rocks. These
lay round in so great a number, that to look for men among them was like
looking for a needle in a bottle of hay; and being so hopeless a task,
it was gone about with the less care. Yet we could see the soldiers
pike their bayonets among the heather, which sent a cold thrill into my
vitals; and they would sometimes hang about our rock, so that we scarce
dared to breathe.

It was in this way that I first heard the right English speech; one
fellow as he went by actually clapping his hand upon the sunny face of
the rock on which we lay, and plucking it off again with an oath. “I
tell you it’s ‘ot,” says he; and I was amazed at the clipping tones and
the odd sing-song in which he spoke, and no less at that strange trick
of dropping out the letter “h.” To be sure, I had heard Ransome; but he
had taken his ways from all sorts of people, and spoke so imperfectly
at the best, that I set down the most of it to childishness. My surprise
was all the greater to hear that manner of speaking in the mouth of a
grown man; and indeed I have never grown used to it; nor yet altogether
with the English grammar, as perhaps a very critical eye might here and
there spy out even in these memoirs.

The tediousness and pain of these hours upon the rock grew only the
greater as the day went on; the rock getting still the hotter and the
sun fiercer. There were giddiness, and sickness, and sharp pangs like
rheumatism, to be supported. I minded then, and have often minded since,
on the lines in our Scotch psalm:--

     “The moon by night thee shall not smite,
     Nor yet the sun by day;”

and indeed it was only by God’s blessing that we were neither of us
sun-smitten.

At last, about two, it was beyond men’s bearing, and there was now
temptation to resist, as well as pain to thole. For the sun being now
got a little into the west, there came a patch of shade on the east side
of our rock, which was the side sheltered from the soldiers.

“As well one death as another,” said Alan, and slipped over the edge and
dropped on the ground on the shadowy side.

I followed him at once, and instantly fell all my length, so weak was I
and so giddy with that long exposure. Here, then, we lay for an hour or
two, aching from head to foot, as weak as water, and lying quite naked
to the eye of any soldier who should have strolled that way. None came,
however, all passing by on the other side; so that our rock continued to
be our shield even in this new position.

Presently we began again to get a little strength; and as the soldiers
were now lying closer along the river-side, Alan proposed that we should
try a start. I was by this time afraid of but one thing in the world;
and that was to be set back upon the rock; anything else was welcome
to me; so we got ourselves at once in marching order, and began to slip
from rock to rock one after the other, now crawling flat on our bellies
in the shade, now making a run for it, heart in mouth.

The soldiers, having searched this side of the valley after a fashion,
and being perhaps somewhat sleepy with the sultriness of the afternoon,
had now laid by much of their vigilance, and stood dozing at their posts
or only kept a look-out along the banks of the river; so that in this
way, keeping down the valley and at the same time towards the mountains,
we drew steadily away from their neighbourhood. But the business was the
most wearing I had ever taken part in. A man had need of a hundred
eyes in every part of him, to keep concealed in that uneven country and
within cry of so many and scattered sentries. When we must pass an open
place, quickness was not all, but a swift judgment not only of the lie
of the whole country, but of the solidity of every stone on which we
must set foot; for the afternoon was now fallen so breathless that the
rolling of a pebble sounded abroad like a pistol shot, and would start
the echo calling among the hills and cliffs.

By sundown we had made some distance, even by our slow rate of progress,
though to be sure the sentry on the rock was still plainly in our view.
But now we came on something that put all fears out of season; and that
was a deep rushing burn, that tore down, in that part, to join the glen
river. At the sight of this we cast ourselves on the ground and plunged
head and shoulders in the water; and I cannot tell which was the more
pleasant, the great shock as the cool stream went over us, or the greed
with which we drank of it.

We lay there (for the banks hid us), drank again and again, bathed our
chests, let our wrists trail in the running water till they ached
with the chill; and at last, being wonderfully renewed, we got out the
meal-bag and made drammach in the iron pan. This, though it is but cold
water mingled with oatmeal, yet makes a good enough dish for a hungry
man; and where there are no means of making fire, or (as in our case)
good reason for not making one, it is the chief stand-by of those who
have taken to the heather.

As soon as the shadow of the night had fallen, we set forth again, at
first with the same caution, but presently with more boldness, standing
our full height and stepping out at a good pace of walking. The way
was very intricate, lying up the steep sides of mountains and along the
brows of cliffs; clouds had come in with the sunset, and the night was
dark and cool; so that I walked without much fatigue, but in continual
fear of falling and rolling down the mountains, and with no guess at our
direction.

The moon rose at last and found us still on the road; it was in its last
quarter, and was long beset with clouds; but after awhile shone out and
showed me many dark heads of mountains, and was reflected far underneath
us on the narrow arm of a sea-loch.

At this sight we both paused: I struck with wonder to find myself so
high and walking (as it seemed to me) upon clouds; Alan to make sure of
his direction.

Seemingly he was well pleased, and he must certainly have judged us
out of ear-shot of all our enemies; for throughout the rest of our
night-march he beguiled the way with whistling of many tunes, warlike,
merry, plaintive; reel tunes that made the foot go faster; tunes of my
own south country that made me fain to be home from my adventures; and
all these, on the great, dark, desert mountains, making company upon the
way.




CHAPTER XXI

THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER: THE HEUGH OF CORRYNAKIEGH

Early as day comes in the beginning of July, it was still dark when we
reached our destination, a cleft in the head of a great mountain, with a
water running through the midst, and upon the one hand a shallow cave
in a rock. Birches grew there in a thin, pretty wood, which a little
farther on was changed into a wood of pines. The burn was full of trout;
the wood of cushat-doves; on the open side of the mountain beyond,
whaups would be always whistling, and cuckoos were plentiful. From the
mouth of the cleft we looked down upon a part of Mamore, and on the
sea-loch that divides that country from Appin; and this from so great
a height as made it my continual wonder and pleasure to sit and behold
them.

The name of the cleft was the Heugh of Corrynakiegh; and although from
its height and being so near upon the sea, it was often beset with
clouds, yet it was on the whole a pleasant place, and the five days we
lived in it went happily.

We slept in the cave, making our bed of heather bushes which we cut for
that purpose, and covering ourselves with Alan’s great-coat. There was a
low concealed place, in a turning of the glen, where we were so bold as
to make fire: so that we could warm ourselves when the clouds set in,
and cook hot porridge, and grill the little trouts that we caught with
our hands under the stones and overhanging banks of the burn. This was
indeed our chief pleasure and business; and not only to save our meal
against worse times, but with a rivalry that much amused us, we spent
a great part of our days at the water-side, stripped to the waist and
groping about or (as they say) guddling for these fish. The largest we
got might have been a quarter of a pound; but they were of good flesh
and flavour, and when broiled upon the coals, lacked only a little salt
to be delicious.

In any by-time Alan must teach me to use my sword, for my ignorance
had much distressed him; and I think besides, as I had sometimes
the upper-hand of him in the fishing, he was not sorry to turn to an
exercise where he had so much the upper-hand of me. He made it somewhat
more of a pain than need have been, for he stormed at me all through the
lessons in a very violent manner of scolding, and would push me so close
that I made sure he must run me through the body. I was often tempted
to turn tail, but held my ground for all that, and got some profit of
my lessons; if it was but to stand on guard with an assured countenance,
which is often all that is required. So, though I could never in the
least please my master, I was not altogether displeased with myself.

In the meanwhile, you are not to suppose that we neglected our chief
business, which was to get away.

“It will be many a long day,” Alan said to me on our first morning,
“before the red-coats think upon seeking Corrynakiegh; so now we must
get word sent to James, and he must find the siller for us.”

“And how shall we send that word?” says I. “We are here in a desert
place, which yet we dare not leave; and unless ye get the fowls of the
air to be your messengers, I see not what we shall be able to do.”

“Ay?” said Alan. “Ye’re a man of small contrivance, David.”

Thereupon he fell in a muse, looking in the embers of the fire; and
presently, getting a piece of wood, he fashioned it in a cross, the four
ends of which he blackened on the coals. Then he looked at me a little
shyly.

“Could ye lend me my button?” says he. “It seems a strange thing to ask
a gift again, but I own I am laith to cut another.”

I gave him the button; whereupon he strung it on a strip of his
great-coat which he had used to bind the cross; and tying in a little
sprig of birch and another of fir, he looked upon his work with
satisfaction.

“Now,” said he, “there is a little clachan” (what is called a hamlet
in the English) “not very far from Corrynakiegh, and it has the name of
Koalisnacoan. There there are living many friends of mine whom I could
trust with my life, and some that I am no just so sure of. Ye see,
David, there will be money set upon our heads; James himsel’ is to set
money on them; and as for the Campbells, they would never spare siller
where there was a Stewart to be hurt. If it was otherwise, I would go
down to Koalisnacoan whatever, and trust my life into these people’s
hands as lightly as I would trust another with my glove.”

“But being so?” said I.

“Being so,” said he, “I would as lief they didnae see me. There’s bad
folk everywhere, and what’s far worse, weak ones. So when it comes dark
again, I will steal down into that clachan, and set this that I have
been making in the window of a good friend of mine, John Breck Maccoll,
a bouman* of Appin’s.”

     *A bouman is a tenant who takes stock from the landlord and
     shares with him the increase.

“With all my heart,” says I; “and if he finds it, what is he to think?”

“Well,” says Alan, “I wish he was a man of more penetration, for by my
troth I am afraid he will make little enough of it! But this is what
I have in my mind. This cross is something in the nature of the
crosstarrie, or fiery cross, which is the signal of gathering in our
clans; yet he will know well enough the clan is not to rise, for there
it is standing in his window, and no word with it. So he will say to
himsel’, THE CLAN IS NOT TO RISE, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING. Then he will
see my button, and that was Duncan Stewart’s. And then he will say to
himsel’, THE SON OF DUNCAN IS IN THE HEATHER, AND HAS NEED OF ME.”

“Well,” said I, “it may be. But even supposing so, there is a good deal
of heather between here and the Forth.”

“And that is a very true word,” says Alan. “But then John Breck will see
the sprig of birch and the sprig of pine; and he will say to himsel’ (if
he is a man of any penetration at all, which I misdoubt), ALAN WILL BE
LYING IN A WOOD WHICH IS BOTH OF PINES AND BIRCHES. Then he will think
to himsel’, THAT IS NOT SO VERY RIFE HEREABOUT; and then he will come
and give us a look up in Corrynakiegh. And if he does not, David, the
devil may fly away with him, for what I care; for he will no be worth
the salt to his porridge.”

“Eh, man,” said I, drolling with him a little, “you’re very ingenious!
But would it not be simpler for you to write him a few words in black
and white?”

“And that is an excellent observe, Mr. Balfour of Shaws,” says Alan,
drolling with me; “and it would certainly be much simpler for me to
write to him, but it would be a sore job for John Breck to read it. He
would have to go to the school for two-three years; and it’s possible we
might be wearied waiting on him.”

So that night Alan carried down his fiery cross and set it in the
bouman’s window. He was troubled when he came back; for the dogs had
barked and the folk run out from their houses; and he thought he had
heard a clatter of arms and seen a red-coat come to one of the doors. On
all accounts we lay the next day in the borders of the wood and kept a
close look-out, so that if it was John Breck that came we might be ready
to guide him, and if it was the red-coats we should have time to get
away.

About noon a man was to be spied, straggling up the open side of the
mountain in the sun, and looking round him as he came, from under his
hand. No sooner had Alan seen him than he whistled; the man turned and
came a little towards us: then Alan would give another “peep!” and the
man would come still nearer; and so by the sound of whistling, he was
guided to the spot where we lay.

He was a ragged, wild, bearded man, about forty, grossly disfigured with
the small pox, and looked both dull and savage. Although his English
was very bad and broken, yet Alan (according to his very handsome use,
whenever I was by) would suffer him to speak no Gaelic. Perhaps the
strange language made him appear more backward than he really was; but
I thought he had little good-will to serve us, and what he had was the
child of terror.

Alan would have had him carry a message to James; but the bouman would
hear of no message. “She was forget it,” he said in his screaming voice;
and would either have a letter or wash his hands of us.

I thought Alan would be gravelled at that, for we lacked the means of
writing in that desert.

But he was a man of more resources than I knew; searched the wood until
he found the quill of a cushat-dove, which he shaped into a pen; made
himself a kind of ink with gunpowder from his horn and water from the
running stream; and tearing a corner from his French military commission
(which he carried in his pocket, like a talisman to keep him from the
gallows), he sat down and wrote as follows:


“DEAR KINSMAN,--Please send the money by the bearer to the place he kens
of.

“Your affectionate cousin,

“A. S.”


This he intrusted to the bouman, who promised to make what manner of
speed he best could, and carried it off with him down the hill.

He was three full days gone, but about five in the evening of the third,
we heard a whistling in the wood, which Alan answered; and presently the
bouman came up the water-side, looking for us, right and left. He seemed
less sulky than before, and indeed he was no doubt well pleased to have
got to the end of such a dangerous commission.

He gave us the news of the country; that it was alive with red-coats;
that arms were being found, and poor folk brought in trouble daily; and
that James and some of his servants were already clapped in prison at
Fort William, under strong suspicion of complicity. It seemed it was
noised on all sides that Alan Breck had fired the shot; and there was a
bill issued for both him and me, with one hundred pounds reward.

This was all as bad as could be; and the little note the bouman had
carried us from Mrs. Stewart was of a miserable sadness. In it she
besought Alan not to let himself be captured, assuring him, if he fell
in the hands of the troops, both he and James were no better than dead
men. The money she had sent was all that she could beg or borrow, and
she prayed heaven we could be doing with it. Lastly, she said, she
enclosed us one of the bills in which we were described.

This we looked upon with great curiosity and not a little fear, partly
as a man may look in a mirror, partly as he might look into the barrel
of an enemy’s gun to judge if it be truly aimed. Alan was advertised as
“a small, pock-marked, active man of thirty-five or thereby, dressed
in a feathered hat, a French side-coat of blue with silver buttons,
and lace a great deal tarnished, a red waistcoat and breeches of black,
shag;” and I as “a tall strong lad of about eighteen, wearing an
old blue coat, very ragged, an old Highland bonnet, a long homespun
waistcoat, blue breeches; his legs bare, low-country shoes, wanting the
toes; speaks like a Lowlander, and has no beard.”

Alan was well enough pleased to see his finery so fully remembered and
set down; only when he came to the word tarnish, he looked upon his lace
like one a little mortified. As for myself, I thought I cut a miserable
figure in the bill; and yet was well enough pleased too, for since I had
changed these rags, the description had ceased to be a danger and become
a source of safety.

“Alan,” said I, “you should change your clothes.”

“Na, troth!” said Alan, “I have nae others. A fine sight I would be, if
I went back to France in a bonnet!”

This put a second reflection in my mind: that if I were to separate
from Alan and his tell-tale clothes I should be safe against arrest, and
might go openly about my business. Nor was this all; for suppose I was
arrested when I was alone, there was little against me; but suppose I
was taken in company with the reputed murderer, my case would begin to
be grave. For generosity’s sake I dare not speak my mind upon this head;
but I thought of it none the less.

I thought of it all the more, too, when the bouman brought out a green
purse with four guineas in gold, and the best part of another in small
change. True, it was more than I had. But then Alan, with less than
five guineas, had to get as far as France; I, with my less than two, not
beyond Queensferry; so that taking things in their proportion, Alan’s
society was not only a peril to my life, but a burden on my purse.

But there was no thought of the sort in the honest head of my companion.
He believed he was serving, helping, and protecting me. And what could I
do but hold my peace, and chafe, and take my chance of it?

“It’s little enough,” said Alan, putting the purse in his pocket, “but
it’ll do my business. And now, John Breck, if ye will hand me over my
button, this gentleman and me will be for taking the road.”

But the bouman, after feeling about in a hairy purse that hung in front
of him in the Highland manner (though he wore otherwise the Lowland
habit, with sea-trousers), began to roll his eyes strangely, and at last
said, “Her nainsel will loss it,” meaning he thought he had lost it.

“What!” cried Alan, “you will lose my button, that was my father’s
before me? Now I will tell you what is in my mind, John Breck: it is
in my mind this is the worst day’s work that ever ye did since ye was
born.”

And as Alan spoke, he set his hands on his knees and looked at the
bouman with a smiling mouth, and that dancing light in his eyes that
meant mischief to his enemies.

Perhaps the bouman was honest enough; perhaps he had meant to cheat and
then, finding himself alone with two of us in a desert place, cast back
to honesty as being safer; at least, and all at once, he seemed to find
that button and handed it to Alan.

“Well, and it is a good thing for the honour of the Maccolls,” said
Alan, and then to me, “Here is my button back again, and I thank you for
parting with it, which is of a piece with all your friendships to me.”
 Then he took the warmest parting of the bouman. “For,” says he, “ye have
done very well by me, and set your neck at a venture, and I will always
give you the name of a good man.”

Lastly, the bouman took himself off by one way; and Alan and I (getting our
chattels together) struck into another to resume our flight.




CHAPTER XXII

THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER: THE MOOR

Some seven hours’ incessant, hard travelling brought us early in the
morning to the end of a range of mountains. In front of us there lay a
piece of low, broken, desert land, which we must now cross. The sun was
not long up, and shone straight in our eyes; a little, thin mist went up
from the face of the moorland like a smoke; so that (as Alan said) there
might have been twenty squadron of dragoons there and we none the wiser.

We sat down, therefore, in a howe of the hill-side till the mist should
have risen, and made ourselves a dish of drammach, and held a council of
war.

“David,” said Alan, “this is the kittle bit. Shall we lie here till it
comes night, or shall we risk it, and stave on ahead?”

“Well,” said I, “I am tired indeed, but I could walk as far again, if
that was all.”

“Ay, but it isnae,” said Alan, “nor yet the half. This is how we stand:
Appin’s fair death to us. To the south it’s all Campbells, and no to be
thought of. To the north; well, there’s no muckle to be gained by going
north; neither for you, that wants to get to Queensferry, nor yet for
me, that wants to get to France. Well, then, we’ll can strike east.”

“East be it!” says I, quite cheerily; but I was thinking in to myself:
“O, man, if you would only take one point of the compass and let me take
any other, it would be the best for both of us.”

“Well, then, east, ye see, we have the muirs,” said Alan. “Once there,
David, it’s mere pitch-and-toss. Out on yon bald, naked, flat place,
where can a body turn to? Let the red-coats come over a hill, they can
spy you miles away; and the sorrow’s in their horses’ heels, they would
soon ride you down. It’s no good place, David; and I’m free to say, it’s
worse by daylight than by dark.”

“Alan,” said I, “hear my way of it. Appin’s death for us; we have none
too much money, nor yet meal; the longer they seek, the nearer they
may guess where we are; it’s all a risk; and I give my word to go ahead
until we drop.”

Alan was delighted. “There are whiles,” said he, “when ye are altogether
too canny and Whiggish to be company for a gentleman like me; but there
come other whiles when ye show yoursel’ a mettle spark; and it’s then,
David, that I love ye like a brother.”

The mist rose and died away, and showed us that country lying as waste
as the sea; only the moorfowl and the pewees crying upon it, and far
over to the east, a herd of deer, moving like dots. Much of it was red
with heather; much of the rest broken up with bogs and hags and peaty
pools; some had been burnt black in a heath fire; and in another place
there was quite a forest of dead firs, standing like skeletons. A
wearier-looking desert man never saw; but at least it was clear of
troops, which was our point.

We went down accordingly into the waste, and began to make our toilsome
and devious travel towards the eastern verge. There were the tops of
mountains all round (you are to remember) from whence we might be spied
at any moment; so it behoved us to keep in the hollow parts of the moor,
and when these turned aside from our direction to move upon its naked
face with infinite care. Sometimes, for half an hour together, we must
crawl from one heather bush to another, as hunters do when they are hard
upon the deer. It was a clear day again, with a blazing sun; the water
in the brandy bottle was soon gone; and altogether, if I had guessed
what it would be to crawl half the time upon my belly and to walk much
of the rest stooping nearly to the knees, I should certainly have held
back from such a killing enterprise.

Toiling and resting and toiling again, we wore away the morning; and
about noon lay down in a thick bush of heather to sleep. Alan took the
first watch; and it seemed to me I had scarce closed my eyes before I
was shaken up to take the second. We had no clock to go by; and Alan
stuck a sprig of heath in the ground to serve instead; so that as soon
as the shadow of the bush should fall so far to the east, I might know
to rouse him. But I was by this time so weary that I could have slept
twelve hours at a stretch; I had the taste of sleep in my throat; my
joints slept even when my mind was waking; the hot smell of the heather,
and the drone of the wild bees, were like possets to me; and every now
and again I would give a jump and find I had been dozing.

The last time I woke I seemed to come back from farther away, and
thought the sun had taken a great start in the heavens. I looked at the
sprig of heath, and at that I could have cried aloud: for I saw I had
betrayed my trust. My head was nearly turned with fear and shame; and at
what I saw, when I looked out around me on the moor, my heart was like
dying in my body. For sure enough, a body of horse-soldiers had come
down during my sleep, and were drawing near to us from the south-east,
spread out in the shape of a fan and riding their horses to and fro in
the deep parts of the heather.

When I waked Alan, he glanced first at the soldiers, then at the mark
and the position of the sun, and knitted his brows with a sudden, quick
look, both ugly and anxious, which was all the reproach I had of him.

“What are we to do now?” I asked.

“We’ll have to play at being hares,” said he. “Do ye see yon mountain?”
 pointing to one on the north-eastern sky.

“Ay,” said I.

“Well, then,” says he, “let us strike for that. Its name is Ben Alder.
it is a wild, desert mountain full of hills and hollows, and if we can
win to it before the morn, we may do yet.”

“But, Alan,” cried I, “that will take us across the very coming of the
soldiers!”

“I ken that fine,” said he; “but if we are driven back on Appin, we are
two dead men. So now, David man, be brisk!”

With that he began to run forward on his hands and knees with an
incredible quickness, as though it were his natural way of going. All
the time, too, he kept winding in and out in the lower parts of the
moorland where we were the best concealed. Some of these had been burned
or at least scathed with fire; and there rose in our faces (which were
close to the ground) a blinding, choking dust as fine as smoke. The
water was long out; and this posture of running on the hands and knees
brings an overmastering weakness and weariness, so that the joints ache
and the wrists faint under your weight.

Now and then, indeed, where was a big bush of heather, we lay awhile,
and panted, and putting aside the leaves, looked back at the dragoons.
They had not spied us, for they held straight on; a half-troop, I think,
covering about two miles of ground, and beating it mighty thoroughly as
they went. I had awakened just in time; a little later, and we must have
fled in front of them, instead of escaping on one side. Even as it was,
the least misfortune might betray us; and now and again, when a grouse
rose out of the heather with a clap of wings, we lay as still as the
dead and were afraid to breathe.

The aching and faintness of my body, the labouring of my heart, the
soreness of my hands, and the smarting of my throat and eyes in the
continual smoke of dust and ashes, had soon grown to be so unbearable
that I would gladly have given up. Nothing but the fear of Alan lent me
enough of a false kind of courage to continue. As for himself (and you
are to bear in mind that he was cumbered with a great-coat) he had first
turned crimson, but as time went on the redness began to be mingled
with patches of white; his breath cried and whistled as it came; and his
voice, when he whispered his observations in my ear during our halts,
sounded like nothing human. Yet he seemed in no way dashed in spirits,
nor did he at all abate in his activity, so that I was driven to marvel
at the man’s endurance.

At length, in the first gloaming of the night, we heard a trumpet sound,
and looking back from among the heather, saw the troop beginning to
collect. A little after, they had built a fire and camped for the night,
about the middle of the waste.

At this I begged and besought that we might lie down and sleep.

“There shall be no sleep the night!” said Alan. “From now on, these
weary dragoons of yours will keep the crown of the muirland, and none
will get out of Appin but winged fowls. We got through in the nick
of time, and shall we jeopard what we’ve gained? Na, na, when the day
comes, it shall find you and me in a fast place on Ben Alder.”

“Alan,” I said, “it’s not the want of will: it’s the strength that I
want. If I could, I would; but as sure as I’m alive I cannot.”

“Very well, then,” said Alan. “I’ll carry ye.”

I looked to see if he were jesting; but no, the little man was in dead
earnest; and the sight of so much resolution shamed me.

“Lead away!” said I. “I’ll follow.”

He gave me one look as much as to say, “Well done, David!” and off he
set again at his top speed.

It grew cooler and even a little darker (but not much) with the coming
of the night. The sky was cloudless; it was still early in July, and
pretty far north; in the darkest part of that night, you would have
needed pretty good eyes to read, but for all that, I have often seen it
darker in a winter mid-day. Heavy dew fell and drenched the moor like
rain; and this refreshed me for a while. When we stopped to breathe,
and I had time to see all about me, the clearness and sweetness of
the night, the shapes of the hills like things asleep, and the fire
dwindling away behind us, like a bright spot in the midst of the moor,
anger would come upon me in a clap that I must still drag myself in
agony and eat the dust like a worm.

By what I have read in books, I think few that have held a pen were ever
really wearied, or they would write of it more strongly. I had no care
of my life, neither past nor future, and I scarce remembered there was
such a lad as David Balfour. I did not think of myself, but just of each
fresh step which I was sure would be my last, with despair--and of Alan,
who was the cause of it, with hatred. Alan was in the right trade as a
soldier; this is the officer’s part to make men continue to do things,
they know not wherefore, and when, if the choice was offered, they would
lie down where they were and be killed. And I dare say I would have made
a good enough private; for in these last hours it never occurred to me
that I had any choice but just to obey as long as I was able, and die
obeying.

Day began to come in, after years, I thought; and by that time we were
past the greatest danger, and could walk upon our feet like men, instead
of crawling like brutes. But, dear heart have mercy! what a pair we must
have made, going double like old grandfathers, stumbling like babes,
and as white as dead folk. Never a word passed between us; each set his
mouth and kept his eyes in front of him, and lifted up his foot and set
it down again, like people lifting weights at a country play;* all the
while, with the moorfowl crying “peep!” in the heather, and the light
coming slowly clearer in the east.

     * Village fair.

I say Alan did as I did. Not that ever I looked at him, for I had enough
ado to keep my feet; but because it is plain he must have been as stupid
with weariness as myself, and looked as little where we were going, or
we should not have walked into an ambush like blind men.

It fell in this way. We were going down a heathery brae, Alan leading
and I following a pace or two behind, like a fiddler and his wife; when
upon a sudden the heather gave a rustle, three or four ragged men leaped
out, and the next moment we were lying on our backs, each with a dirk at
his throat.

I don’t think I cared; the pain of this rough handling was quite
swallowed up by the pains of which I was already full; and I was too
glad to have stopped walking to mind about a dirk. I lay looking up in
the face of the man that held me; and I mind his face was black with the
sun, and his eyes very light, but I was not afraid of him. I heard Alan
and another whispering in the Gaelic; and what they said was all one to
me.

Then the dirks were put up, our weapons were taken away, and we were set
face to face, sitting in the heather.

“They are Cluny’s men,” said Alan. “We couldnae have fallen better.
We’re just to bide here with these, which are his out-sentries, till
they can get word to the chief of my arrival.”

Now Cluny Macpherson, the chief of the clan Vourich, had been one of the
leaders of the great rebellion six years before; there was a price on
his life; and I had supposed him long ago in France, with the rest of
the heads of that desperate party. Even tired as I was, the surprise of
what I heard half wakened me.

“What,” I cried, “is Cluny still here?”

“Ay, is he so!” said Alan. “Still in his own country and kept by his own
clan. King George can do no more.”

I think I would have asked farther, but Alan gave me the put-off. “I am
rather wearied,” he said, “and I would like fine to get a sleep.” And
without more words, he rolled on his face in a deep heather bush, and
seemed to sleep at once.

There was no such thing possible for me. You have heard grasshoppers
whirring in the grass in the summer time? Well, I had no sooner closed
my eyes, than my body, and above all my head, belly, and wrists, seemed
to be filled with whirring grasshoppers; and I must open my eyes again
at once, and tumble and toss, and sit up and lie down; and look at the
sky which dazzled me, or at Cluny’s wild and dirty sentries, peering out
over the top of the brae and chattering to each other in the Gaelic.

That was all the rest I had, until the messenger returned; when, as it
appeared that Cluny would be glad to receive us, we must get once more
upon our feet and set forward. Alan was in excellent good spirits, much
refreshed by his sleep, very hungry, and looking pleasantly forward to
a dram and a dish of hot collops, of which, it seems, the messenger had
brought him word. For my part, it made me sick to hear of eating. I had
been dead-heavy before, and now I felt a kind of dreadful lightness,
which would not suffer me to walk. I drifted like a gossamer; the ground
seemed to me a cloud, the hills a feather-weight, the air to have a
current, like a running burn, which carried me to and fro. With all
that, a sort of horror of despair sat on my mind, so that I could have
wept at my own helplessness.

I saw Alan knitting his brows at me, and supposed it was in anger; and
that gave me a pang of light-headed fear, like what a child may have. I
remember, too, that I was smiling, and could not stop smiling, hard as
I tried; for I thought it was out of place at such a time. But my good
companion had nothing in his mind but kindness; and the next moment,
two of the gillies had me by the arms, and I began to be carried forward
with great swiftness (or so it appeared to me, although I dare say it
was slowly enough in truth), through a labyrinth of dreary glens and
hollows and into the heart of that dismal mountain of Ben Alder.




CHAPTER XXIII

CLUNY’S CAGE

We came at last to the foot of an exceeding steep wood, which scrambled
up a craggy hillside, and was crowned by a naked precipice.

“It’s here,” said one of the guides, and we struck up hill.

The trees clung upon the slope, like sailors on the shrouds of a ship,
and their trunks were like the rounds of a ladder, by which we mounted.

Quite at the top, and just before the rocky face of the cliff sprang
above the foliage, we found that strange house which was known in the
country as “Cluny’s Cage.” The trunks of several trees had been wattled
across, the intervals strengthened with stakes, and the ground behind
this barricade levelled up with earth to make the floor. A tree, which
grew out from the hillside, was the living centre-beam of the roof.
The walls were of wattle and covered with moss. The whole house had
something of an egg shape; and it half hung, half stood in that steep,
hillside thicket, like a wasp’s nest in a green hawthorn.

Within, it was large enough to shelter five or six persons with some
comfort. A projection of the cliff had been cunningly employed to be the
fireplace; and the smoke rising against the face of the rock, and being
not dissimilar in colour, readily escaped notice from below.

This was but one of Cluny’s hiding-places; he had caves, besides, and
underground chambers in several parts of his country; and following the
reports of his scouts, he moved from one to another as the soldiers
drew near or moved away. By this manner of living, and thanks to the
affection of his clan, he had not only stayed all this time in safety,
while so many others had fled or been taken and slain: but stayed four
or five years longer, and only went to France at last by the express
command of his master. There he soon died; and it is strange to reflect
that he may have regretted his Cage upon Ben Alder.

When we came to the door he was seated by his rock chimney, watching a
gillie about some cookery. He was mighty plainly habited, with a knitted
nightcap drawn over his ears, and smoked a foul cutty pipe. For all that
he had the manners of a king, and it was quite a sight to see him rise
out of his place to welcome us.

“Well, Mr. Stewart, come awa’, sir!” said he, “and bring in your friend
that as yet I dinna ken the name of.”

“And how is yourself, Cluny?” said Alan. “I hope ye do brawly, sir. And
I am proud to see ye, and to present to ye my friend the Laird of Shaws,
Mr. David Balfour.”

Alan never referred to my estate without a touch of a sneer, when we
were alone; but with strangers, he rang the words out like a herald.

“Step in by, the both of ye, gentlemen,” says Cluny. “I make ye welcome
to my house, which is a queer, rude place for certain, but one where I
have entertained a royal personage, Mr. Stewart--ye doubtless ken the
personage I have in my eye. We’ll take a dram for luck, and as soon as
this handless man of mine has the collops ready, we’ll dine and take a
hand at the cartes as gentlemen should. My life is a bit driegh,” says
he, pouring out the brandy; “I see little company, and sit and twirl my
thumbs, and mind upon a great day that is gone by, and weary for another
great day that we all hope will be upon the road. And so here’s a toast
to ye: The Restoration!”

Thereupon we all touched glasses and drank. I am sure I wished no ill
to King George; and if he had been there himself in proper person, it’s
like he would have done as I did. No sooner had I taken out the drain
than I felt hugely better, and could look on and listen, still a little
mistily perhaps, but no longer with the same groundless horror and
distress of mind.

It was certainly a strange place, and we had a strange host. In his long
hiding, Cluny had grown to have all manner of precise habits, like those
of an old maid. He had a particular place, where no one else must sit;
the Cage was arranged in a particular way, which none must disturb;
cookery was one of his chief fancies, and even while he was greeting us
in, he kept an eye to the collops.

It appears, he sometimes visited or received visits from his wife and
one or two of his nearest friends, under the cover of night; but for the
more part lived quite alone, and communicated only with his sentinels
and the gillies that waited on him in the Cage. The first thing in the
morning, one of them, who was a barber, came and shaved him, and gave
him the news of the country, of which he was immoderately greedy. There
was no end to his questions; he put them as earnestly as a child; and
at some of the answers, laughed out of all bounds of reason, and would
break out again laughing at the mere memory, hours after the barber was
gone.

To be sure, there might have been a purpose in his questions; for
though he was thus sequestered, and like the other landed gentlemen of
Scotland, stripped by the late Act of Parliament of legal powers, he
still exercised a patriarchal justice in his clan. Disputes were brought
to him in his hiding-hole to be decided; and the men of his country,
who would have snapped their fingers at the Court of Session, laid
aside revenge and paid down money at the bare word of this forfeited and
hunted outlaw. When he was angered, which was often enough, he gave
his commands and breathed threats of punishment like any king; and his
gillies trembled and crouched away from him like children before a hasty
father. With each of them, as he entered, he ceremoniously shook hands,
both parties touching their bonnets at the same time in a military
manner. Altogether, I had a fair chance to see some of the inner
workings of a Highland clan; and this with a proscribed, fugitive chief;
his country conquered; the troops riding upon all sides in quest of
him, sometimes within a mile of where he lay; and when the least of the
ragged fellows whom he rated and threatened, could have made a fortune
by betraying him.

On that first day, as soon as the collops were ready, Cluny gave them
with his own hand a squeeze of a lemon (for he was well supplied with
luxuries) and bade us draw in to our meal.

“They,” said he, meaning the collops, “are such as I gave his Royal
Highness in this very house; bating the lemon juice, for at that time we
were glad to get the meat and never fashed for kitchen.* Indeed, there
were mair dragoons than lemons in my country in the year forty-six.”

     * Condiment.

I do not know if the collops were truly very good, but my heart rose
against the sight of them, and I could eat but little. All the while
Cluny entertained us with stories of Prince Charlie’s stay in the Cage,
giving us the very words of the speakers, and rising from his place
to show us where they stood. By these, I gathered the Prince was a
gracious, spirited boy, like the son of a race of polite kings, but not
so wise as Solomon. I gathered, too, that while he was in the Cage, he
was often drunk; so the fault that has since, by all accounts, made such
a wreck of him, had even then begun to show itself.

We were no sooner done eating than Cluny brought out an old, thumbed,
greasy pack of cards, such as you may find in a mean inn; and his eyes
brightened in his face as he proposed that we should fall to playing.

Now this was one of the things I had been brought up to eschew like
disgrace; it being held by my father neither the part of a Christian
nor yet of a gentleman to set his own livelihood and fish for that of
others, on the cast of painted pasteboard. To be sure, I might have
pleaded my fatigue, which was excuse enough; but I thought it behoved
that I should bear a testimony. I must have got very red in the face,
but I spoke steadily, and told them I had no call to be a judge
of others, but for my own part, it was a matter in which I had no
clearness.

Cluny stopped mingling the cards. “What in deil’s name is this?” says
he. “What kind of Whiggish, canting talk is this, for the house of Cluny
Macpherson?”

“I will put my hand in the fire for Mr. Balfour,” says Alan. “He is an
honest and a mettle gentleman, and I would have ye bear in mind who says
it. I bear a king’s name,” says he, cocking his hat; “and I and any that
I call friend are company for the best. But the gentleman is tired, and
should sleep; if he has no mind to the cartes, it will never hinder you
and me. And I’m fit and willing, sir, to play ye any game that ye can
name.”

“Sir,” says Cluny, “in this poor house of mine I would have you to ken
that any gentleman may follow his pleasure. If your friend would like to
stand on his head, he is welcome. And if either he, or you, or any other
man, is not preceesely satisfied, I will be proud to step outside with
him.”

I had no will that these two friends should cut their throats for my
sake.

“Sir,” said I, “I am very wearied, as Alan says; and what’s more, as
you are a man that likely has sons of your own, I may tell you it was a
promise to my father.”

“Say nae mair, say nae mair,” said Cluny, and pointed me to a bed of
heather in a corner of the Cage. For all that he was displeased enough,
looked at me askance, and grumbled when he looked. And indeed it must
be owned that both my scruples and the words in which I declared them,
smacked somewhat of the Covenanter, and were little in their place among
wild Highland Jacobites.

What with the brandy and the venison, a strange heaviness had come over
me; and I had scarce lain down upon the bed before I fell into a kind
of trance, in which I continued almost the whole time of our stay in the
Cage. Sometimes I was broad awake and understood what passed; sometimes
I only heard voices, or men snoring, like the voice of a silly river;
and the plaids upon the wall dwindled down and swelled out again, like
firelight shadows on the roof. I must sometimes have spoken or cried
out, for I remember I was now and then amazed at being answered; yet
I was conscious of no particular nightmare, only of a general, black,
abiding horror--a horror of the place I was in, and the bed I lay in,
and the plaids on the wall, and the voices, and the fire, and myself.

The barber-gillie, who was a doctor too, was called in to prescribe
for me; but as he spoke in the Gaelic, I understood not a word of his
opinion, and was too sick even to ask for a translation. I knew well
enough I was ill, and that was all I cared about.

I paid little heed while I lay in this poor pass. But Alan and Cluny
were most of the time at the cards, and I am clear that Alan must have
begun by winning; for I remember sitting up, and seeing them hard at it,
and a great glittering pile of as much as sixty or a hundred guineas on
the table. It looked strange enough, to see all this wealth in a nest
upon a cliff-side, wattled about growing trees. And even then, I
thought it seemed deep water for Alan to be riding, who had no better
battle-horse than a green purse and a matter of five pounds.

The luck, it seems, changed on the second day. About noon I was wakened
as usual for dinner, and as usual refused to eat, and was given a dram
with some bitter infusion which the barber had prescribed. The sun was
shining in at the open door of the Cage, and this dazzled and offended
me. Cluny sat at the table, biting the pack of cards. Alan had stooped
over the bed, and had his face close to my eyes; to which, troubled as
they were with the fever, it seemed of the most shocking bigness.

He asked me for a loan of my money.

“What for?” said I.

“O, just for a loan,” said he.

“But why?” I repeated. “I don’t see.”

“Hut, David!” said Alan, “ye wouldnae grudge me a loan?”

I would, though, if I had had my senses! But all I thought of then was
to get his face away, and I handed him my money.

On the morning of the third day, when we had been forty-eight hours in
the Cage, I awoke with a great relief of spirits, very weak and weary
indeed, but seeing things of the right size and with their honest,
everyday appearance. I had a mind to eat, moreover, rose from bed of my
own movement, and as soon as we had breakfasted, stepped to the entry of
the Cage and sat down outside in the top of the wood. It was a grey day
with a cool, mild air: and I sat in a dream all morning, only disturbed
by the passing by of Cluny’s scouts and servants coming with provisions
and reports; for as the coast was at that time clear, you might almost
say he held court openly.

When I returned, he and Alan had laid the cards aside, and were
questioning a gillie; and the chief turned about and spoke to me in the
Gaelic.

“I have no Gaelic, sir,” said I.

Now since the card question, everything I said or did had the power of
annoying Cluny. “Your name has more sense than yourself, then,” said he
angrily, “for it’s good Gaelic. But the point is this. My scout reports
all clear in the south, and the question is, have ye the strength to
go?”

I saw cards on the table, but no gold; only a heap of little written
papers, and these all on Cluny’s side. Alan, besides, had an odd
look, like a man not very well content; and I began to have a strong
misgiving.

“I do not know if I am as well as I should be,” said I, looking at Alan;
“but the little money we have has a long way to carry us.”

Alan took his under-lip into his mouth, and looked upon the ground.

“David,” says he at last, “I’ve lost it; there’s the naked truth.”

“My money too?” said I.

“Your money too,” says Alan, with a groan. “Ye shouldnae have given it
me. I’m daft when I get to the cartes.”

“Hoot-toot! hoot-toot!” said Cluny. “It was all daffing; it’s all
nonsense. Of course you’ll have your money back again, and the double of
it, if ye’ll make so free with me. It would be a singular thing for me
to keep it. It’s not to be supposed that I would be any hindrance to
gentlemen in your situation; that would be a singular thing!” cries he,
and began to pull gold out of his pocket with a mighty red face.

Alan said nothing, only looked on the ground.

“Will you step to the door with me, sir?” said I.

Cluny said he would be very glad, and followed me readily enough, but he
looked flustered and put out.

“And now, sir,” says I, “I must first acknowledge your generosity.”

“Nonsensical nonsense!” cries Cluny. “Where’s the generosity? This is
just a most unfortunate affair; but what would ye have me do--boxed
up in this bee-skep of a cage of mine--but just set my friends to the
cartes, when I can get them? And if they lose, of course, it’s not to be
supposed----” And here he came to a pause.

“Yes,” said I, “if they lose, you give them back their money; and if
they win, they carry away yours in their pouches! I have said before
that I grant your generosity; but to me, sir, it’s a very painful thing
to be placed in this position.”

There was a little silence, in which Cluny seemed always as if he was
about to speak, but said nothing. All the time he grew redder and redder
in the face.

“I am a young man,” said I, “and I ask your advice. Advise me as you
would your son. My friend fairly lost his money, after having fairly
gained a far greater sum of yours; can I accept it back again? Would
that be the right part for me to play? Whatever I do, you can see for
yourself it must be hard upon a man of any pride.”

“It’s rather hard on me, too, Mr. Balfour,” said Cluny, “and ye give
me very much the look of a man that has entrapped poor people to their
hurt. I wouldnae have my friends come to any house of mine to accept
affronts; no,” he cried, with a sudden heat of anger, “nor yet to give
them!”

“And so you see, sir,” said I, “there is something to be said upon my
side; and this gambling is a very poor employ for gentlefolks. But I am
still waiting your opinion.”

I am sure if ever Cluny hated any man it was David Balfour. He looked
me all over with a warlike eye, and I saw the challenge at his lips.
But either my youth disarmed him, or perhaps his own sense of justice.
Certainly it was a mortifying matter for all concerned, and not least
Cluny; the more credit that he took it as he did.

“Mr. Balfour,” said he, “I think you are too nice and covenanting, but
for all that you have the spirit of a very pretty gentleman. Upon my
honest word, ye may take this money--it’s what I would tell my son--and
here’s my hand along with it!”




CHAPTER XXIV

THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER: THE QUARREL

Alan and I were put across Loch Errocht under cloud of night, and went
down its eastern shore to another hiding-place near the head of Loch
Rannoch, whither we were led by one of the gillies from the Cage. This
fellow carried all our luggage and Alan’s great-coat in the bargain,
trotting along under the burthen, far less than the half of which used
to weigh me to the ground, like a stout hill pony with a feather; yet he
was a man that, in plain contest, I could have broken on my knee.

Doubtless it was a great relief to walk disencumbered; and perhaps
without that relief, and the consequent sense of liberty and lightness,
I could not have walked at all. I was but new risen from a bed of
sickness; and there was nothing in the state of our affairs to hearten
me for much exertion; travelling, as we did, over the most dismal
deserts in Scotland, under a cloudy heaven, and with divided hearts
among the travellers.

For long, we said nothing; marching alongside or one behind the other,
each with a set countenance: I, angry and proud, and drawing what
strength I had from these two violent and sinful feelings; Alan angry
and ashamed, ashamed that he had lost my money, angry that I should take
it so ill.

The thought of a separation ran always the stronger in my mind; and the
more I approved of it, the more ashamed I grew of my approval. It would
be a fine, handsome, generous thing, indeed, for Alan to turn round and
say to me: “Go, I am in the most danger, and my company only increases
yours.” But for me to turn to the friend who certainly loved me, and say
to him: “You are in great danger, I am in but little; your friendship
is a burden; go, take your risks and bear your hardships alone----” no,
that was impossible; and even to think of it privily to myself, made my
cheeks to burn.

And yet Alan had behaved like a child, and (what is worse) a treacherous
child. Wheedling my money from me while I lay half-conscious was scarce
better than theft; and yet here he was trudging by my side, without a
penny to his name, and by what I could see, quite blithe to sponge upon
the money he had driven me to beg. True, I was ready to share it with
him; but it made me rage to see him count upon my readiness.

These were the two things uppermost in my mind; and I could open my
mouth upon neither without black ungenerosity. So I did the next worst,
and said nothing, nor so much as looked once at my companion, save with
the tail of my eye.

At last, upon the other side of Loch Errocht, going over a smooth, rushy
place, where the walking was easy, he could bear it no longer, and came
close to me.

“David,” says he, “this is no way for two friends to take a small
accident. I have to say that I’m sorry; and so that’s said. And now if
you have anything, ye’d better say it.”

“O,” says I, “I have nothing.”

He seemed disconcerted; at which I was meanly pleased.

“No,” said he, with rather a trembling voice, “but when I say I was to
blame?”

“Why, of course, ye were to blame,” said I, coolly; “and you will bear
me out that I have never reproached you.”

“Never,” says he; “but ye ken very well that ye’ve done worse. Are we to
part? Ye said so once before. Are ye to say it again? There’s hills and
heather enough between here and the two seas, David; and I will own I’m
no very keen to stay where I’m no wanted.”

This pierced me like a sword, and seemed to lay bare my private
disloyalty.

“Alan Breck!” I cried; and then: “Do you think I am one to turn my
back on you in your chief need? You dursn’t say it to my face. My whole
conduct’s there to give the lie to it. It’s true, I fell asleep upon
the muir; but that was from weariness, and you do wrong to cast it up to
me----”

“Which is what I never did,” said Alan.

“But aside from that,” I continued, “what have I done that you should
even me to dogs by such a supposition? I never yet failed a friend, and
it’s not likely I’ll begin with you. There are things between us that I
can never forget, even if you can.”

“I will only say this to ye, David,” said Alan, very quietly, “that I
have long been owing ye my life, and now I owe ye money. Ye should try
to make that burden light for me.”

This ought to have touched me, and in a manner it did, but the wrong
manner. I felt I was behaving badly; and was now not only angry with
Alan, but angry with myself in the bargain; and it made me the more
cruel.

“You asked me to speak,” said I. “Well, then, I will. You own yourself
that you have done me a disservice; I have had to swallow an affront: I
have never reproached you, I never named the thing till you did. And
now you blame me,” cried I, “because I cannae laugh and sing as if I was
glad to be affronted. The next thing will be that I’m to go down upon my
knees and thank you for it! Ye should think more of others, Alan
Breck. If ye thought more of others, ye would perhaps speak less about
yourself; and when a friend that likes you very well has passed over an
offence without a word, you would be blithe to let it lie, instead of
making it a stick to break his back with. By your own way of it, it was
you that was to blame; then it shouldnae be you to seek the quarrel.”

“Aweel,” said Alan, “say nae mair.”

And we fell back into our former silence; and came to our journey’s end,
and supped, and lay down to sleep, without another word.

The gillie put us across Loch Rannoch in the dusk of the next day, and
gave us his opinion as to our best route. This was to get us up at once
into the tops of the mountains: to go round by a circuit, turning the
heads of Glen Lyon, Glen Lochay, and Glen Dochart, and come down upon
the lowlands by Kippen and the upper waters of the Forth. Alan was
little pleased with a route which led us through the country of his
blood-foes, the Glenorchy Campbells. He objected that by turning to the
east, we should come almost at once among the Athole Stewarts, a race of
his own name and lineage, although following a different chief, and come
besides by a far easier and swifter way to the place whither we were
bound. But the gillie, who was indeed the chief man of Cluny’s scouts,
had good reasons to give him on all hands, naming the force of troops
in every district, and alleging finally (as well as I could understand)
that we should nowhere be so little troubled as in a country of the
Campbells.

Alan gave way at last, but with only half a heart. “It’s one of the
dowiest countries in Scotland,” said he. “There’s naething there that I
ken, but heath, and crows, and Campbells. But I see that ye’re a man of
some penetration; and be it as ye please!”

We set forth accordingly by this itinerary; and for the best part of
three nights travelled on eerie mountains and among the well-heads of
wild rivers; often buried in mist, almost continually blown and rained
upon, and not once cheered by any glimpse of sunshine. By day, we lay
and slept in the drenching heather; by night, incessantly clambered upon
break-neck hills and among rude crags. We often wandered; we were often
so involved in fog, that we must lie quiet till it lightened. A fire was
never to be thought of. Our only food was drammach and a portion of cold
meat that we had carried from the Cage; and as for drink, Heaven knows
we had no want of water.

This was a dreadful time, rendered the more dreadful by the gloom of
the weather and the country. I was never warm; my teeth chattered in my
head; I was troubled with a very sore throat, such as I had on the isle;
I had a painful stitch in my side, which never left me; and when I slept
in my wet bed, with the rain beating above and the mud oozing below me,
it was to live over again in fancy the worst part of my adventures--to
see the tower of Shaws lit by lightning, Ransome carried below on the
men’s backs, Shuan dying on the round-house floor, or Colin Campbell
grasping at the bosom of his coat. From such broken slumbers, I would be
aroused in the gloaming, to sit up in the same puddle where I had slept,
and sup cold drammach; the rain driving sharp in my face or running
down my back in icy trickles; the mist enfolding us like as in a gloomy
chamber--or, perhaps, if the wind blew, falling suddenly apart and
showing us the gulf of some dark valley where the streams were crying
aloud.

The sound of an infinite number of rivers came up from all round. In
this steady rain the springs of the mountain were broken up; every glen
gushed water like a cistern; every stream was in high spate, and had
filled and overflowed its channel. During our night tramps, it was
solemn to hear the voice of them below in the valleys, now booming like
thunder, now with an angry cry. I could well understand the story of the
Water Kelpie, that demon of the streams, who is fabled to keep wailing
and roaring at the ford until the coming of the doomed traveller. Alan I
saw believed it, or half believed it; and when the cry of the river rose
more than usually sharp, I was little surprised (though, of course, I
would still be shocked) to see him cross himself in the manner of the
Catholics.

During all these horrid wanderings we had no familiarity, scarcely even
that of speech. The truth is that I was sickening for my grave, which
is my best excuse. But besides that I was of an unforgiving disposition
from my birth, slow to take offence, slower to forget it, and now
incensed both against my companion and myself. For the best part of two
days he was unweariedly kind; silent, indeed, but always ready to help,
and always hoping (as I could very well see) that my displeasure would
blow by. For the same length of time I stayed in myself, nursing my
anger, roughly refusing his services, and passing him over with my eyes
as if he had been a bush or a stone.

The second night, or rather the peep of the third day, found us upon a
very open hill, so that we could not follow our usual plan and lie down
immediately to eat and sleep. Before we had reached a place of shelter,
the grey had come pretty clear, for though it still rained, the clouds
ran higher; and Alan, looking in my face, showed some marks of concern.

“Ye had better let me take your pack,” said he, for perhaps the ninth
time since we had parted from the scout beside Loch Rannoch.

“I do very well, I thank you,” said I, as cold as ice.

Alan flushed darkly. “I’ll not offer it again,” he said. “I’m not a
patient man, David.”

“I never said you were,” said I, which was exactly the rude, silly
speech of a boy of ten.

Alan made no answer at the time, but his conduct answered for him.
Henceforth, it is to be thought, he quite forgave himself for the affair
at Cluny’s; cocked his hat again, walked jauntily, whistled airs, and
looked at me upon one side with a provoking smile.

The third night we were to pass through the western end of the country
of Balquhidder. It came clear and cold, with a touch in the air like
frost, and a northerly wind that blew the clouds away and made the stars
bright. The streams were full, of course, and still made a great noise
among the hills; but I observed that Alan thought no more upon the
Kelpie, and was in high good spirits. As for me, the change of weather
came too late; I had lain in the mire so long that (as the Bible has it)
my very clothes “abhorred me.” I was dead weary, deadly sick and full
of pains and shiverings; the chill of the wind went through me, and the
sound of it confused my ears. In this poor state I had to bear from
my companion something in the nature of a persecution. He spoke a good
deal, and never without a taunt. “Whig” was the best name he had to give
me. “Here,” he would say, “here’s a dub for ye to jump, my Whiggie! I
ken you’re a fine jumper!” And so on; all the time with a gibing voice
and face.

I knew it was my own doing, and no one else’s; but I was too miserable
to repent. I felt I could drag myself but little farther; pretty soon, I
must lie down and die on these wet mountains like a sheep or a fox, and
my bones must whiten there like the bones of a beast. My head was light
perhaps; but I began to love the prospect, I began to glory in the
thought of such a death, alone in the desert, with the wild eagles
besieging my last moments. Alan would repent then, I thought; he would
remember, when I was dead, how much he owed me, and the remembrance
would be torture. So I went like a sick, silly, and bad-hearted
schoolboy, feeding my anger against a fellow-man, when I would have
been better on my knees, crying on God for mercy. And at each of Alan’s
taunts, I hugged myself. “Ah!” thinks I to myself, “I have a better
taunt in readiness; when I lie down and die, you will feel it like a
buffet in your face; ah, what a revenge! ah, how you will regret your
ingratitude and cruelty!”

All the while, I was growing worse and worse. Once I had fallen, my leg
simply doubling under me, and this had struck Alan for the moment; but I
was afoot so briskly, and set off again with such a natural manner,
that he soon forgot the incident. Flushes of heat went over me, and then
spasms of shuddering. The stitch in my side was hardly bearable. At last
I began to feel that I could trail myself no farther: and with that,
there came on me all at once the wish to have it out with Alan, let my
anger blaze, and be done with my life in a more sudden manner. He had
just called me “Whig.” I stopped.

“Mr. Stewart,” said I, in a voice that quivered like a fiddle-string,
“you are older than I am, and should know your manners. Do you think
it either very wise or very witty to cast my politics in my teeth? I
thought, where folk differed, it was the part of gentlemen to differ
civilly; and if I did not, I may tell you I could find a better taunt
than some of yours.”

Alan had stopped opposite to me, his hat cocked, his hands in his
breeches pockets, his head a little on one side. He listened, smiling
evilly, as I could see by the starlight; and when I had done he began to
whistle a Jacobite air. It was the air made in mockery of General Cope’s
defeat at Preston Pans:

     “Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye waukin’ yet?
     And are your drums a-beatin’ yet?”

And it came in my mind that Alan, on the day of that battle, had been
engaged upon the royal side.

“Why do ye take that air, Mr. Stewart?” said I. “Is that to remind me
you have been beaten on both sides?”

The air stopped on Alan’s lips. “David!” said he.

“But it’s time these manners ceased,” I continued; “and I mean you shall
henceforth speak civilly of my King and my good friends the Campbells.”

“I am a Stewart--” began Alan.

“O!” says I, “I ken ye bear a king’s name. But you are to remember,
since I have been in the Highlands, I have seen a good many of those
that bear it; and the best I can say of them is this, that they would be
none the worse of washing.”

“Do you know that you insult me?” said Alan, very low.

“I am sorry for that,” said I, “for I am not done; and if you distaste
the sermon, I doubt the pirliecue* will please you as little. You have
been chased in the field by the grown men of my party; it seems a poor
kind of pleasure to out-face a boy. Both the Campbells and the Whigs
have beaten you; you have run before them like a hare. It behoves you to
speak of them as of your betters.”

     * A second sermon.

Alan stood quite still, the tails of his great-coat clapping behind him
in the wind.

“This is a pity,” he said at last. “There are things said that cannot be
passed over.”

“I never asked you to,” said I. “I am as ready as yourself.”

“Ready?” said he.

“Ready,” I repeated. “I am no blower and boaster like some that I could
name. Come on!” And drawing my sword, I fell on guard as Alan himself
had taught me.

“David!” he cried. “Are ye daft? I cannae draw upon ye, David. It’s
fair murder.”

“That was your look-out when you insulted me,” said I.

“It’s the truth!” cried Alan, and he stood for a moment, wringing his
mouth in his hand like a man in sore perplexity. “It’s the bare truth,”
 he said, and drew his sword. But before I could touch his blade with
mine, he had thrown it from him and fallen to the ground. “Na, na,” he
kept saying, “na, na--I cannae, I cannae.”

At this the last of my anger oozed all out of me; and I found myself
only sick, and sorry, and blank, and wondering at myself. I would have
given the world to take back what I had said; but a word once spoken,
who can recapture it? I minded me of all Alan’s kindness and courage in
the past, how he had helped and cheered and borne with me in our evil
days; and then recalled my own insults, and saw that I had lost for ever
that doughty friend. At the same time, the sickness that hung upon
me seemed to redouble, and the pang in my side was like a sword for
sharpness. I thought I must have swooned where I stood.

This it was that gave me a thought. No apology could blot out what I had
said; it was needless to think of one, none could cover the offence; but
where an apology was vain, a mere cry for help might bring Alan back to
my side. I put my pride away from me. “Alan!” I said; “if ye cannae help
me, I must just die here.”

He started up sitting, and looked at me.

“It’s true,” said I. “I’m by with it. O, let me get into the bield of a
house--I’ll can die there easier.” I had no need to pretend; whether I
chose or not, I spoke in a weeping voice that would have melted a heart
of stone.

“Can ye walk?” asked Alan.

“No,” said I, “not without help. This last hour my legs have been
fainting under me; I’ve a stitch in my side like a red-hot iron; I
cannae breathe right. If I die, ye’ll can forgive me, Alan? In my heart,
I liked ye fine--even when I was the angriest.”

“Wheesht, wheesht!” cried Alan. “Dinna say that! David man, ye ken--” He
shut his mouth upon a sob. “Let me get my arm about ye,” he continued;
“that’s the way! Now lean upon me hard. Gude kens where there’s a house!
We’re in Balwhidder, too; there should be no want of houses, no, nor
friends’ houses here. Do ye gang easier so, Davie?”

“Ay,” said I, “I can be doing this way;” and I pressed his arm with my
hand.

Again he came near sobbing. “Davie,” said he, “I’m no a right man at
all; I have neither sense nor kindness; I could nae remember ye were
just a bairn, I couldnae see ye were dying on your feet; Davie, ye’ll
have to try and forgive me.”

“O man, let’s say no more about it!” said I. “We’re neither one of us
to mend the other--that’s the truth! We must just bear and forbear, man
Alan. O, but my stitch is sore! Is there nae house?”

“I’ll find a house to ye, David,” he said, stoutly. “We’ll follow down
the burn, where there’s bound to be houses. My poor man, will ye no be
better on my back?”

“O, Alan,” says I, “and me a good twelve inches taller?”

“Ye’re no such a thing,” cried Alan, with a start. “There may be a
trifling matter of an inch or two; I’m no saying I’m just exactly what
ye would call a tall man, whatever; and I dare say,” he added, his voice
tailing off in a laughable manner, “now when I come to think of it, I
dare say ye’ll be just about right. Ay, it’ll be a foot, or near hand;
or may be even mair!”

It was sweet and laughable to hear Alan eat his words up in the fear of
some fresh quarrel. I could have laughed, had not my stitch caught me so
hard; but if I had laughed, I think I must have wept too.

“Alan,” cried I, “what makes ye so good to me? What makes ye care for
such a thankless fellow?”

“‘Deed, and I don’t know” said Alan. “For just precisely what I thought
I liked about ye, was that ye never quarrelled:--and now I like ye
better!”




CHAPTER XXV

IN BALQUHIDDER

At the door of the first house we came to, Alan knocked, which was of
no very safe enterprise in such a part of the Highlands as the Braes of
Balquhidder. No great clan held rule there; it was filled and disputed
by small septs, and broken remnants, and what they call “chiefless
folk,” driven into the wild country about the springs of Forth and Teith
by the advance of the Campbells. Here were Stewarts and Maclarens, which
came to the same thing, for the Maclarens followed Alan’s chief in war,
and made but one clan with Appin. Here, too, were many of that old,
proscribed, nameless, red-handed clan of the Macgregors. They had always
been ill-considered, and now worse than ever, having credit with no side
or party in the whole country of Scotland. Their chief, Macgregor of
Macgregor, was in exile; the more immediate leader of that part of them
about Balquhidder, James More, Rob Roy’s eldest son, lay waiting his
trial in Edinburgh Castle; they were in ill-blood with Highlander and
Lowlander, with the Grahames, the Maclarens, and the Stewarts; and Alan,
who took up the quarrel of any friend, however distant, was extremely
wishful to avoid them.

Chance served us very well; for it was a household of Maclarens that we
found, where Alan was not only welcome for his name’s sake but known
by reputation. Here then I was got to bed without delay, and a doctor
fetched, who found me in a sorry plight. But whether because he was a
very good doctor, or I a very young, strong man, I lay bedridden for no
more than a week, and before a month I was able to take the road again
with a good heart.

All this time Alan would not leave me though I often pressed him, and
indeed his foolhardiness in staying was a common subject of outcry with
the two or three friends that were let into the secret. He hid by day
in a hole of the braes under a little wood; and at night, when the coast
was clear, would come into the house to visit me. I need not say if I
was pleased to see him; Mrs. Maclaren, our hostess, thought nothing good
enough for such a guest; and as Duncan Dhu (which was the name of our
host) had a pair of pipes in his house, and was much of a lover of
music, this time of my recovery was quite a festival, and we commonly
turned night into day.

The soldiers let us be; although once a party of two companies and some
dragoons went by in the bottom of the valley, where I could see them
through the window as I lay in bed. What was much more astonishing, no
magistrate came near me, and there was no question put of whence I came
or whither I was going; and in that time of excitement, I was as free of
all inquiry as though I had lain in a desert. Yet my presence was known
before I left to all the people in Balquhidder and the adjacent parts;
many coming about the house on visits and these (after the custom of the
country) spreading the news among their neighbours. The bills, too, had
now been printed. There was one pinned near the foot of my bed, where
I could read my own not very flattering portrait and, in larger
characters, the amount of the blood money that had been set upon my
life. Duncan Dhu and the rest that knew that I had come there in Alan’s
company, could have entertained no doubt of who I was; and many others
must have had their guess. For though I had changed my clothes, I could
not change my age or person; and Lowland boys of eighteen were not so
rife in these parts of the world, and above all about that time, that
they could fail to put one thing with another, and connect me with the
bill. So it was, at least. Other folk keep a secret among two or three
near friends, and somehow it leaks out; but among these clansmen, it is
told to a whole countryside, and they will keep it for a century.

There was but one thing happened worth narrating; and that is the visit
I had of Robin Oig, one of the sons of the notorious Rob Roy. He was
sought upon all sides on a charge of carrying a young woman from
Balfron and marrying her (as was alleged) by force; yet he stepped about
Balquhidder like a gentleman in his own walled policy. It was he who had
shot James Maclaren at the plough stilts, a quarrel never satisfied; yet
he walked into the house of his blood enemies as a rider* might into a
     public inn.* Commercial traveller.

Duncan had time to pass me word of who it was; and we looked at one
another in concern. You should understand, it was then close upon the
time of Alan’s coming; the two were little likely to agree; and yet if
we sent word or sought to make a signal, it was sure to arouse suspicion
in a man under so dark a cloud as the Macgregor.

He came in with a great show of civility, but like a man among
inferiors; took off his bonnet to Mrs. Maclaren, but clapped it on his
head again to speak to Duncan; and having thus set himself (as he would
have thought) in a proper light, came to my bedside and bowed.

“I am given to know, sir,” says he, “that your name is Balfour.”

“They call me David Balfour,” said I, “at your service.”

“I would give ye my name in return, sir,” he replied, “but it’s one
somewhat blown upon of late days; and it’ll perhaps suffice if I tell
ye that I am own brother to James More Drummond or Macgregor, of whom ye
will scarce have failed to hear.”

“No, sir,” said I, a little alarmed; “nor yet of your father,
Macgregor-Campbell.” And I sat up and bowed in bed; for I thought best
to compliment him, in case he was proud of having had an outlaw to his
father.

He bowed in return. “But what I am come to say, sir,” he went on, “is
this. In the year ‘45, my brother raised a part of the ‘Gregara’ and
marched six companies to strike a stroke for the good side; and the
surgeon that marched with our clan and cured my brother’s leg when it
was broken in the brush at Preston Pans, was a gentleman of the same
name precisely as yourself. He was brother to Balfour of Baith; and if
you are in any reasonable degree of nearness one of that gentleman’s
kin, I have come to put myself and my people at your command.”

You are to remember that I knew no more of my descent than any cadger’s
dog; my uncle, to be sure, had prated of some of our high connections,
but nothing to the present purpose; and there was nothing left me but
that bitter disgrace of owning that I could not tell.

Robin told me shortly he was sorry he had put himself about, turned his
back upon me without a sign of salutation, and as he went towards the
door, I could hear him telling Duncan that I was “only some kinless loon
that didn’t know his own father.” Angry as I was at these words, and
ashamed of my own ignorance, I could scarce keep from smiling that a
man who was under the lash of the law (and was indeed hanged some three
years later) should be so nice as to the descent of his acquaintances.

Just in the door, he met Alan coming in; and the two drew back and
looked at each other like strange dogs. They were neither of them big
men, but they seemed fairly to swell out with pride. Each wore a sword,
and by a movement of his haunch, thrust clear the hilt of it, so that it
might be the more readily grasped and the blade drawn.

“Mr. Stewart, I am thinking,” says Robin.

“Troth, Mr. Macgregor, it’s not a name to be ashamed of,” answered Alan.

“I did not know ye were in my country, sir,” says Robin.

“It sticks in my mind that I am in the country of my friends the
Maclarens,” says Alan.

“That’s a kittle point,” returned the other. “There may be two words to
say to that. But I think I will have heard that you are a man of your
sword?”

“Unless ye were born deaf, Mr. Macgregor, ye will have heard a good deal
more than that,” says Alan. “I am not the only man that can draw steel
in Appin; and when my kinsman and captain, Ardshiel, had a talk with a
gentleman of your name, not so many years back, I could never hear that
the Macgregor had the best of it.”

“Do ye mean my father, sir?” says Robin.

“Well, I wouldnae wonder,” said Alan. “The gentleman I have in my mind
had the ill-taste to clap Campbell to his name.”

“My father was an old man,” returned Robin.

“The match was unequal. You and me would make a better pair, sir.”

“I was thinking that,” said Alan.

I was half out of bed, and Duncan had been hanging at the elbow of these
fighting cocks, ready to intervene upon the least occasion. But when
that word was uttered, it was a case of now or never; and Duncan, with
something of a white face to be sure, thrust himself between.

“Gentlemen,” said he, “I will have been thinking of a very different
matter, whateffer. Here are my pipes, and here are you two gentlemen who
are baith acclaimed pipers. It’s an auld dispute which one of ye’s the
best. Here will be a braw chance to settle it.”

“Why, sir,” said Alan, still addressing Robin, from whom indeed he had
not so much as shifted his eyes, nor yet Robin from him, “why, sir,”
 says Alan, “I think I will have heard some sough* of the sort. Have ye
music, as folk say? Are ye a bit of a piper?”

     * Rumour.

“I can pipe like a Macrimmon!” cries Robin.

“And that is a very bold word,” quoth Alan.

“I have made bolder words good before now,” returned Robin, “and that
against better adversaries.”

“It is easy to try that,” says Alan.

Duncan Dhu made haste to bring out the pair of pipes that was his
principal possession, and to set before his guests a mutton-ham and a
bottle of that drink which they call Athole brose, and which is made of
old whiskey, strained honey and sweet cream, slowly beaten together in
the right order and proportion. The two enemies were still on the very
breach of a quarrel; but down they sat, one upon each side of the peat
fire, with a mighty show of politeness. Maclaren pressed them to taste
his mutton-ham and “the wife’s brose,” reminding them the wife was out
of Athole and had a name far and wide for her skill in that confection.
But Robin put aside these hospitalities as bad for the breath.

“I would have ye to remark, sir,” said Alan, “that I havenae broken
bread for near upon ten hours, which will be worse for the breath than
any brose in Scotland.”

“I will take no advantages, Mr. Stewart,” replied Robin. “Eat and drink;
I’ll follow you.”

Each ate a small portion of the ham and drank a glass of the brose to
Mrs. Maclaren; and then after a great number of civilities, Robin took
the pipes and played a little spring in a very ranting manner.

“Ay, ye can blow” said Alan; and taking the instrument from his rival,
he first played the same spring in a manner identical with Robin’s; and
then wandered into variations, which, as he went on, he decorated with
a perfect flight of grace-notes, such as pipers love, and call the
“warblers.”

I had been pleased with Robin’s playing, Alan’s ravished me.

“That’s no very bad, Mr. Stewart,” said the rival, “but ye show a poor
device in your warblers.”

“Me!” cried Alan, the blood starting to his face. “I give ye the lie.”

“Do ye own yourself beaten at the pipes, then,” said Robin, “that ye
seek to change them for the sword?”

“And that’s very well said, Mr. Macgregor,” returned Alan; “and in the
meantime” (laying a strong accent on the word) “I take back the lie. I
appeal to Duncan.”

“Indeed, ye need appeal to naebody,” said Robin. “Ye’re a far better
judge than any Maclaren in Balquhidder: for it’s a God’s truth that
you’re a very creditable piper for a Stewart. Hand me the pipes.” Alan
did as he asked; and Robin proceeded to imitate and correct some part of
Alan’s variations, which it seemed that he remembered perfectly.

“Ay, ye have music,” said Alan, gloomily.

“And now be the judge yourself, Mr. Stewart,” said Robin; and taking up
the variations from the beginning, he worked them throughout to so new a
purpose, with such ingenuity and sentiment, and with so odd a fancy and
so quick a knack in the grace-notes, that I was amazed to hear him.

As for Alan, his face grew dark and hot, and he sat and gnawed his
fingers, like a man under some deep affront. “Enough!” he cried. “Ye can
blow the pipes--make the most of that.” And he made as if to rise.

But Robin only held out his hand as if to ask for silence, and struck
into the slow measure of a pibroch. It was a fine piece of music in
itself, and nobly played; but it seems, besides, it was a piece peculiar
to the Appin Stewarts and a chief favourite with Alan. The first notes
were scarce out, before there came a change in his face; when the time
quickened, he seemed to grow restless in his seat; and long before that
piece was at an end, the last signs of his anger died from him, and he
had no thought but for the music.

“Robin Oig,” he said, when it was done, “ye are a great piper. I am not
fit to blow in the same kingdom with ye. Body of me! ye have mair music
in your sporran than I have in my head! And though it still sticks in
my mind that I could maybe show ye another of it with the cold steel,
I warn ye beforehand--it’ll no be fair! It would go against my heart to
haggle a man that can blow the pipes as you can!”

Thereupon that quarrel was made up; all night long the brose was going
and the pipes changing hands; and the day had come pretty bright, and
the three men were none the better for what they had been taking, before
Robin as much as thought upon the road.




CHAPTER XXVI

END OF THE FLIGHT: WE PASS THE FORTH

The month, as I have said, was not yet out, but it was already far
through August, and beautiful warm weather, with every sign of an early
and great harvest, when I was pronounced able for my journey. Our money
was now run to so low an ebb that we must think first of all on speed;
for if we came not soon to Mr. Rankeillor’s, or if when we came there he
should fail to help me, we must surely starve. In Alan’s view, besides,
the hunt must have now greatly slackened; and the line of the Forth and
even Stirling Bridge, which is the main pass over that river, would be
watched with little interest.

“It’s a chief principle in military affairs,” said he, “to go where
ye are least expected. Forth is our trouble; ye ken the saying, ‘Forth
bridles the wild Hielandman.’ Well, if we seek to creep round about
the head of that river and come down by Kippen or Balfron, it’s just
precisely there that they’ll be looking to lay hands on us. But if we
stave on straight to the auld Brig of Stirling, I’ll lay my sword they
let us pass unchallenged.”

The first night, accordingly, we pushed to the house of a Maclaren in
Strathire, a friend of Duncan’s, where we slept the twenty-first of the
month, and whence we set forth again about the fall of night to make
another easy stage. The twenty-second we lay in a heather bush on the
hillside in Uam Var, within view of a herd of deer, the happiest ten
hours of sleep in a fine, breathing sunshine and on bone-dry ground,
that I have ever tasted. That night we struck Allan Water, and followed
it down; and coming to the edge of the hills saw the whole Carse of
Stirling underfoot, as flat as a pancake, with the town and castle on a
hill in the midst of it, and the moon shining on the Links of Forth.

“Now,” said Alan, “I kenna if ye care, but ye’re in your own land again.
We passed the Hieland Line in the first hour; and now if we could but
pass yon crooked water, we might cast our bonnets in the air.”

In Allan Water, near by where it falls into the Forth, we found a little
sandy islet, overgrown with burdock, butterbur and the like low plants,
that would just cover us if we lay flat. Here it was we made our camp,
within plain view of Stirling Castle, whence we could hear the drums
beat as some part of the garrison paraded. Shearers worked all day in
a field on one side of the river, and we could hear the stones going
on the hooks and the voices and even the words of the men talking. It
behoved to lie close and keep silent. But the sand of the little isle
was sun-warm, the green plants gave us shelter for our heads, we had
food and drink in plenty; and to crown all, we were within sight of
safety.

As soon as the shearers quit their work and the dusk began to fall,
we waded ashore and struck for the Bridge of Stirling, keeping to the
fields and under the field fences.

The bridge is close under the castle hill, an old, high, narrow bridge
with pinnacles along the parapet; and you may conceive with how much
interest I looked upon it, not only as a place famous in history, but as
the very doors of salvation to Alan and myself. The moon was not yet up
when we came there; a few lights shone along the front of the fortress,
and lower down a few lighted windows in the town; but it was all mighty
still, and there seemed to be no guard upon the passage.

I was for pushing straight across; but Alan was more wary.

“It looks unco’ quiet,” said he; “but for all that we’ll lie down here
cannily behind a dyke, and make sure.”

So we lay for about a quarter of an hour, whiles whispering, whiles
lying still and hearing nothing earthly but the washing of the water on
the piers. At last there came by an old, hobbling woman with a crutch
stick; who first stopped a little, close to where we lay, and bemoaned
herself and the long way she had travelled; and then set forth again up
the steep spring of the bridge. The woman was so little, and the night
still so dark, that we soon lost sight of her; only heard the sound of
her steps, and her stick, and a cough that she had by fits, draw slowly
farther away.

“She’s bound to be across now,” I whispered.

“Na,” said Alan, “her foot still sounds boss* upon the bridge.”

     * Hollow.

And just then--“Who goes?” cried a voice, and we heard the butt of
a musket rattle on the stones. I must suppose the sentry had been
sleeping, so that had we tried, we might have passed unseen; but he was
awake now, and the chance forfeited.

“This’ll never do,” said Alan. “This’ll never, never do for us, David.”

And without another word, he began to crawl away through the fields; and
a little after, being well out of eye-shot, got to his feet again, and
struck along a road that led to the eastward. I could not conceive what
he was doing; and indeed I was so sharply cut by the disappointment,
that I was little likely to be pleased with anything. A moment back
and I had seen myself knocking at Mr. Rankeillor’s door to claim my
inheritance, like a hero in a ballad; and here was I back again, a
wandering, hunted blackguard, on the wrong side of Forth.

“Well?” said I.

“Well,” said Alan, “what would ye have? They’re none such fools as I
took them for. We have still the Forth to pass, Davie--weary fall the
rains that fed and the hillsides that guided it!”

“And why go east?” said I.

“Ou, just upon the chance!” said he. “If we cannae pass the river, we’ll
have to see what we can do for the firth.”

“There are fords upon the river, and none upon the firth,” said I.

“To be sure there are fords, and a bridge forbye,” quoth Alan; “and of
what service, when they are watched?”

“Well,” said I, “but a river can be swum.”

“By them that have the skill of it,” returned he; “but I have yet to
hear that either you or me is much of a hand at that exercise; and for
my own part, I swim like a stone.”

“I’m not up to you in talking back, Alan,” I said; “but I can see we’re
making bad worse. If it’s hard to pass a river, it stands to reason it
must be worse to pass a sea.”

“But there’s such a thing as a boat,” says Alan, “or I’m the more
deceived.”

“Ay, and such a thing as money,” says I. “But for us that have neither
one nor other, they might just as well not have been invented.”

“Ye think so?” said Alan.

“I do that,” said I.

“David,” says he, “ye’re a man of small invention and less faith. But
let me set my wits upon the hone, and if I cannae beg, borrow, nor yet
steal a boat, I’ll make one!”

“I think I see ye!” said I. “And what’s more than all that: if ye pass a
bridge, it can tell no tales; but if we pass the firth, there’s the boat
on the wrong side--somebody must have brought it--the country-side will
all be in a bizz---”

“Man!” cried Alan, “if I make a boat, I’ll make a body to take it back
again! So deave me with no more of your nonsense, but walk (for that’s
what you’ve got to do)--and let Alan think for ye.”

All night, then, we walked through the north side of the Carse under
the high line of the Ochil mountains; and by Alloa and Clackmannan and
Culross, all of which we avoided: and about ten in the morning, mighty
hungry and tired, came to the little clachan of Limekilns. This is a
place that sits near in by the water-side, and looks across the Hope to
the town of the Queensferry. Smoke went up from both of these, and from
other villages and farms upon all hands. The fields were being reaped;
two ships lay anchored, and boats were coming and going on the Hope.
It was altogether a right pleasant sight to me; and I could not take
my fill of gazing at these comfortable, green, cultivated hills and the
busy people both of the field and sea.

For all that, there was Mr. Rankeillor’s house on the south shore, where
I had no doubt wealth awaited me; and here was I upon the north, clad in
poor enough attire of an outlandish fashion, with three silver shillings
left to me of all my fortune, a price set upon my head, and an outlawed
man for my sole company.

“O, Alan!” said I, “to think of it! Over there, there’s all that heart
could want waiting me; and the birds go over, and the boats go over--all
that please can go, but just me only! O, man, but it’s a heart-break!”

In Limekilns we entered a small change-house, which we only knew to be a
public by the wand over the door, and bought some bread and cheese from
a good-looking lass that was the servant. This we carried with us in a
bundle, meaning to sit and eat it in a bush of wood on the sea-shore,
that we saw some third part of a mile in front. As we went, I kept
looking across the water and sighing to myself; and though I took no
heed of it, Alan had fallen into a muse. At last he stopped in the way.

“Did ye take heed of the lass we bought this of?” says he, tapping on
the bread and cheese.

“To be sure,” said I, “and a bonny lass she was.”

“Ye thought that?” cries he. “Man, David, that’s good news.”

“In the name of all that’s wonderful, why so?” says I. “What good can
that do?”

“Well,” said Alan, with one of his droll looks, “I was rather in hopes
it would maybe get us that boat.”

“If it were the other way about, it would be liker it,” said I.

“That’s all that you ken, ye see,” said Alan. “I don’t want the lass to
fall in love with ye, I want her to be sorry for ye, David; to which end
there is no manner of need that she should take you for a beauty. Let me
see” (looking me curiously over). “I wish ye were a wee thing paler; but
apart from that ye’ll do fine for my purpose--ye have a fine, hang-dog,
rag-and-tatter, clappermaclaw kind of a look to ye, as if ye had
stolen the coat from a potato-bogle. Come; right about, and back to the
change-house for that boat of ours.”

I followed him, laughing.

“David Balfour,” said he, “ye’re a very funny gentleman by your way of
it, and this is a very funny employ for ye, no doubt. For all that, if
ye have any affection for my neck (to say nothing of your own) ye will
perhaps be kind enough to take this matter responsibly. I am going to
do a bit of play-acting, the bottom ground of which is just exactly as
serious as the gallows for the pair of us. So bear it, if ye please, in
mind, and conduct yourself according.”

“Well, well,” said I, “have it as you will.”

As we got near the clachan, he made me take his arm and hang upon it
like one almost helpless with weariness; and by the time he pushed
open the change-house door, he seemed to be half carrying me. The maid
appeared surprised (as well she might be) at our speedy return; but
Alan had no words to spare for her in explanation, helped me to a chair,
called for a tass of brandy with which he fed me in little sips,
and then breaking up the bread and cheese helped me to eat it like
a nursery-lass; the whole with that grave, concerned, affectionate
countenance, that might have imposed upon a judge. It was small wonder
if the maid were taken with the picture we presented, of a poor, sick,
overwrought lad and his most tender comrade. She drew quite near, and
stood leaning with her back on the next table.

“What’s like wrong with him?” said she at last.

Alan turned upon her, to my great wonder, with a kind of fury. “Wrong?”
 cries he. “He’s walked more hundreds of miles than he has hairs upon his
chin, and slept oftener in wet heather than dry sheets. Wrong, quo’ she!
Wrong enough, I would think! Wrong, indeed!” and he kept grumbling to
himself as he fed me, like a man ill-pleased.

“He’s young for the like of that,” said the maid.

“Ower young,” said Alan, with his back to her.

“He would be better riding,” says she.

“And where could I get a horse to him?” cried Alan, turning on her with
the same appearance of fury. “Would ye have me steal?”

I thought this roughness would have sent her off in dudgeon, as indeed
it closed her mouth for the time. But my companion knew very well what
he was doing; and for as simple as he was in some things of life, had a
great fund of roguishness in such affairs as these.

“Ye neednae tell me,” she said at last--“ye’re gentry.”

“Well,” said Alan, softened a little (I believe against his will) by
this artless comment, “and suppose we were? Did ever you hear that
gentrice put money in folk’s pockets?”

She sighed at this, as if she were herself some disinherited great lady.
“No,” says she, “that’s true indeed.”

I was all this while chafing at the part I played, and sitting
tongue-tied between shame and merriment; but somehow at this I could
hold in no longer, and bade Alan let me be, for I was better already. My
voice stuck in my throat, for I ever hated to take part in lies; but my
very embarrassment helped on the plot, for the lass no doubt set down my
husky voice to sickness and fatigue.

“Has he nae friends?” said she, in a tearful voice.

“That has he so!” cried Alan, “if we could but win to them!--friends and
rich friends, beds to lie in, food to eat, doctors to see to him--and
here he must tramp in the dubs and sleep in the heather like a
beggarman.”

“And why that?” says the lass.

“My dear,” said Alan, “I cannae very safely say; but I’ll tell ye what
I’ll do instead,” says he, “I’ll whistle ye a bit tune.” And with that
he leaned pretty far over the table, and in a mere breath of a whistle,
but with a wonderful pretty sentiment, gave her a few bars of “Charlie
is my darling.”

“Wheesht,” says she, and looked over her shoulder to the door.

“That’s it,” said Alan.

“And him so young!” cries the lass.

“He’s old enough to----” and Alan struck his forefinger on the back part
of his neck, meaning that I was old enough to lose my head.

“It would be a black shame,” she cried, flushing high.

“It’s what will be, though,” said Alan, “unless we manage the better.”

At this the lass turned and ran out of that part of the house, leaving
us alone together. Alan in high good humour at the furthering of his
schemes, and I in bitter dudgeon at being called a Jacobite and treated
like a child.

“Alan,” I cried, “I can stand no more of this.”

“Ye’ll have to sit it then, Davie,” said he. “For if ye upset the pot
now, ye may scrape your own life out of the fire, but Alan Breck is a
dead man.”

This was so true that I could only groan; and even my groan served
Alan’s purpose, for it was overheard by the lass as she came flying in
again with a dish of white puddings and a bottle of strong ale.

“Poor lamb!” says she, and had no sooner set the meat before us, than
she touched me on the shoulder with a little friendly touch, as much as
to bid me cheer up. Then she told us to fall to, and there would be no
more to pay; for the inn was her own, or at least her father’s, and he
was gone for the day to Pittencrieff. We waited for no second bidding,
for bread and cheese is but cold comfort and the puddings smelt
excellently well; and while we sat and ate, she took up that same place
by the next table, looking on, and thinking, and frowning to herself,
and drawing the string of her apron through her hand.

“I’m thinking ye have rather a long tongue,” she said at last to Alan.

“Ay” said Alan; “but ye see I ken the folk I speak to.”

“I would never betray ye,” said she, “if ye mean that.”

“No,” said he, “ye’re not that kind. But I’ll tell ye what ye would do,
ye would help.”

“I couldnae,” said she, shaking her head. “Na, I couldnae.”

“No,” said he, “but if ye could?”

She answered him nothing.

“Look here, my lass,” said Alan, “there are boats in the Kingdom of
Fife, for I saw two (no less) upon the beach, as I came in by your
town’s end. Now if we could have the use of a boat to pass under cloud
of night into Lothian, and some secret, decent kind of a man to bring
that boat back again and keep his counsel, there would be two souls
saved--mine to all likelihood--his to a dead surety. If we lack that
boat, we have but three shillings left in this wide world; and where
to go, and how to do, and what other place there is for us except the
chains of a gibbet--I give you my naked word, I kenna! Shall we go
wanting, lassie? Are ye to lie in your warm bed and think upon us, when
the wind gowls in the chimney and the rain tirls on the roof? Are ye to
eat your meat by the cheeks of a red fire, and think upon this poor sick
lad of mine, biting his finger ends on a blae muir for cauld and hunger?
Sick or sound, he must aye be moving; with the death grapple at his
throat he must aye be trailing in the rain on the lang roads; and when
he gants his last on a rickle of cauld stanes, there will be nae friends
near him but only me and God.”

At this appeal, I could see the lass was in great trouble of mind,
being tempted to help us, and yet in some fear she might be helping
malefactors; and so now I determined to step in myself and to allay her
scruples with a portion of the truth.

“Did ever you hear,” said I, “of Mr. Rankeillor of the Ferry?”

“Rankeillor the writer?” said she. “I daur say that!”

“Well,” said I, “it’s to his door that I am bound, so you may judge by
that if I am an ill-doer; and I will tell you more, that though I am
indeed, by a dreadful error, in some peril of my life, King George has
no truer friend in all Scotland than myself.”

Her face cleared up mightily at this, although Alan’s darkened.

“That’s more than I would ask,” said she. “Mr. Rankeillor is a kennt
man.” And she bade us finish our meat, get clear of the clachan as soon
as might be, and lie close in the bit wood on the sea-beach. “And ye can
trust me,” says she, “I’ll find some means to put you over.”

At this we waited for no more, but shook hands with her upon the
bargain, made short work of the puddings, and set forth again from
Limekilns as far as to the wood. It was a small piece of perhaps a score
of elders and hawthorns and a few young ashes, not thick enough to veil
us from passersby upon the road or beach. Here we must lie, however,
making the best of the brave warm weather and the good hopes we now had
of a deliverance, and planing more particularly what remained for us to
do.

We had but one trouble all day; when a strolling piper came and sat in
the same wood with us; a red-nosed, bleareyed, drunken dog, with a great
bottle of whisky in his pocket, and a long story of wrongs that had been
done him by all sorts of persons, from the Lord President of the
Court of Session, who had denied him justice, down to the Bailies of
Inverkeithing who had given him more of it than he desired. It was
impossible but he should conceive some suspicion of two men lying all
day concealed in a thicket and having no business to allege. As long as
he stayed there he kept us in hot water with prying questions; and after
he was gone, as he was a man not very likely to hold his tongue, we were
in the greater impatience to be gone ourselves.

The day came to an end with the same brightness; the night fell quiet
and clear; lights came out in houses and hamlets and then, one after
another, began to be put out; but it was past eleven, and we were long
since strangely tortured with anxieties, before we heard the grinding
of oars upon the rowing-pins. At that, we looked out and saw the lass
herself coming rowing to us in a boat. She had trusted no one with our
affairs, not even her sweetheart, if she had one; but as soon as her
father was asleep, had left the house by a window, stolen a neighbour’s
boat, and come to our assistance single-handed.

I was abashed how to find expression for my thanks; but she was no less
abashed at the thought of hearing them; begged us to lose no time and to
hold our peace, saying (very properly) that the heart of our matter was
in haste and silence; and so, what with one thing and another, she had
set us on the Lothian shore not far from Carriden, had shaken hands with
us, and was out again at sea and rowing for Limekilns, before there was
one word said either of her service or our gratitude.

Even after she was gone, we had nothing to say, as indeed nothing was
enough for such a kindness. Only Alan stood a great while upon the shore
shaking his head.

“It is a very fine lass,” he said at last. “David, it is a very fine
lass.” And a matter of an hour later, as we were lying in a den on
the sea-shore and I had been already dozing, he broke out again in
commendations of her character. For my part, I could say nothing, she
was so simple a creature that my heart smote me both with remorse and
fear: remorse because we had traded upon her ignorance; and fear lest we
should have anyway involved her in the dangers of our situation.




CHAPTER XXVII

I COME TO MR. RANKEILLOR

The next day it was agreed that Alan should fend for himself till
sunset; but as soon as it began to grow dark, he should lie in the
fields by the roadside near to Newhalls, and stir for naught until he
heard me whistling. At first I proposed I should give him for a signal
the “Bonnie House of Airlie,” which was a favourite of mine; but he
objected that as the piece was very commonly known, any ploughman might
whistle it by accident; and taught me instead a little fragment of a
Highland air, which has run in my head from that day to this, and will
likely run in my head when I lie dying. Every time it comes to me, it
takes me off to that last day of my uncertainty, with Alan sitting up in
the bottom of the den, whistling and beating the measure with a finger,
and the grey of the dawn coming on his face.

I was in the long street of Queensferry before the sun was up. It was a
fairly built burgh, the houses of good stone, many slated; the town-hall
not so fine, I thought, as that of Peebles, nor yet the street so noble;
but take it altogether, it put me to shame for my foul tatters.



As the morning went on, and the fires began to be kindled, and the
windows to open, and the people to appear out of the houses, my concern
and despondency grew ever the blacker. I saw now that I had no grounds
to stand upon; and no clear proof of my rights, nor so much as of my own
identity. If it was all a bubble, I was indeed sorely cheated and left
in a sore pass. Even if things were as I conceived, it would in all
likelihood take time to establish my contentions; and what time had I
to spare with less than three shillings in my pocket, and a condemned,
hunted man upon my hands to ship out of the country? Truly, if my hope
broke with me, it might come to the gallows yet for both of us. And as I
continued to walk up and down, and saw people looking askance at me upon
the street or out of windows, and nudging or speaking one to another
with smiles, I began to take a fresh apprehension: that it might be no
easy matter even to come to speech of the lawyer, far less to convince
him of my story.

For the life of me I could not muster up the courage to address any of
these reputable burghers; I thought shame even to speak with them in
such a pickle of rags and dirt; and if I had asked for the house of such
a man as Mr. Rankeillor, I suppose they would have burst out laughing in
my face. So I went up and down, and through the street, and down to
the harbour-side, like a dog that has lost its master, with a strange
gnawing in my inwards, and every now and then a movement of despair.
It grew to be high day at last, perhaps nine in the forenoon; and I was
worn with these wanderings, and chanced to have stopped in front of
a very good house on the landward side, a house with beautiful, clear
glass windows, flowering knots upon the sills, the walls new-harled* and
a chase-dog sitting yawning on the step like one that was at home. Well,
I was even envying this dumb brute, when the door fell open and
there issued forth a shrewd, ruddy, kindly, consequential man in a
well-powdered wig and spectacles. I was in such a plight that no one set
eyes on me once, but he looked at me again; and this gentleman, as it
proved, was so much struck with my poor appearance that he came straight
up to me and asked me what I did.

     * Newly rough-cast.

I told him I was come to the Queensferry on business, and taking heart
of grace, asked him to direct me to the house of Mr. Rankeillor.

“Why,” said he, “that is his house that I have just come out of; and for
a rather singular chance, I am that very man.”

“Then, sir,” said I, “I have to beg the favour of an interview.”

“I do not know your name,” said he, “nor yet your face.”

“My name is David Balfour,” said I.

“David Balfour?” he repeated, in rather a high tone, like one surprised.
“And where have you come from, Mr. David Balfour?” he asked, looking me
pretty drily in the face.

“I have come from a great many strange places, sir,” said I; “but I
think it would be as well to tell you where and how in a more private
manner.”

He seemed to muse awhile, holding his lip in his hand, and looking now
at me and now upon the causeway of the street.

“Yes,” says he, “that will be the best, no doubt.” And he led me back
with him into his house, cried out to some one whom I could not see
that he would be engaged all morning, and brought me into a little dusty
chamber full of books and documents. Here he sate down, and bade me
be seated; though I thought he looked a little ruefully from his clean
chair to my muddy rags. “And now,” says he, “if you have any business,
pray be brief and come swiftly to the point. Nec gemino bellum Trojanum
orditur ab ovo--do you understand that?” says he, with a keen look.

“I will even do as Horace says, sir,” I answered, smiling, “and carry
you in medias res.” He nodded as if he was well pleased, and indeed his
scrap of Latin had been set to test me. For all that, and though I was
somewhat encouraged, the blood came in my face when I added: “I have
reason to believe myself some rights on the estate of Shaws.”

He got a paper book out of a drawer and set it before him open. “Well?”
 said he.

But I had shot my bolt and sat speechless.

“Come, come, Mr. Balfour,” said he, “you must continue. Where were you
born?”

“In Essendean, sir,” said I, “the year 1733, the 12th of March.”

He seemed to follow this statement in his paper book; but what that
meant I knew not. “Your father and mother?” said he.

“My father was Alexander Balfour, schoolmaster of that place,” said I,
“and my mother Grace Pitarrow; I think her people were from Angus.”

“Have you any papers proving your identity?” asked Mr. Rankeillor.

“No, sir,” said I, “but they are in the hands of Mr. Campbell, the
minister, and could be readily produced. Mr. Campbell, too, would give
me his word; and for that matter, I do not think my uncle would deny
me.”

“Meaning Mr. Ebenezer Balfour?” says he.

“The same,” said I.

“Whom you have seen?” he asked.

“By whom I was received into his own house,” I answered.

“Did you ever meet a man of the name of Hoseason?” asked Mr. Rankeillor.

“I did so, sir, for my sins,” said I; “for it was by his means and the
procurement of my uncle, that I was kidnapped within sight of this town,
carried to sea, suffered shipwreck and a hundred other hardships, and
stand before you to-day in this poor accoutrement.”

“You say you were shipwrecked,” said Rankeillor; “where was that?”

“Off the south end of the Isle of Mull,” said I. “The name of the isle
on which I was cast up is the Island Earraid.”

“Ah!” says he, smiling, “you are deeper than me in the geography. But so
far, I may tell you, this agrees pretty exactly with other informations
that I hold. But you say you were kidnapped; in what sense?”

“In the plain meaning of the word, sir,” said I. “I was on my way to
your house, when I was trepanned on board the brig, cruelly struck down,
thrown below, and knew no more of anything till we were far at sea. I
was destined for the plantations; a fate that, in God’s providence, I
have escaped.”

“The brig was lost on June the 27th,” says he, looking in his book,
“and we are now at August the 24th. Here is a considerable hiatus, Mr.
Balfour, of near upon two months. It has already caused a vast amount
of trouble to your friends; and I own I shall not be very well contented
until it is set right.”

“Indeed, sir,” said I, “these months are very easily filled up; but yet
before I told my story, I would be glad to know that I was talking to a
friend.”

“This is to argue in a circle,” said the lawyer. “I cannot be convinced
till I have heard you. I cannot be your friend till I am properly
informed. If you were more trustful, it would better befit your time of
life. And you know, Mr. Balfour, we have a proverb in the country that
evil-doers are aye evil-dreaders.”

“You are not to forget, sir,” said I, “that I have already suffered by
my trustfulness; and was shipped off to be a slave by the very man that
(if I rightly understand) is your employer?”

All this while I had been gaining ground with Mr. Rankeillor, and in
proportion as I gained ground, gaining confidence. But at this sally,
which I made with something of a smile myself, he fairly laughed aloud.

“No, no,” said he, “it is not so bad as that. Fui, non sum. I was indeed
your uncle’s man of business; but while you (imberbis juvenis custode
remoto) were gallivanting in the west, a good deal of water has run
under the bridges; and if your ears did not sing, it was not for lack of
being talked about. On the very day of your sea disaster, Mr. Campbell
stalked into my office, demanding you from all the winds. I had never
heard of your existence; but I had known your father; and from matters
in my competence (to be touched upon hereafter) I was disposed to fear
the worst. Mr. Ebenezer admitted having seen you; declared (what seemed
improbable) that he had given you considerable sums; and that you had
started for the continent of Europe, intending to fulfil your education,
which was probable and praiseworthy. Interrogated how you had come to
send no word to Mr. Campbell, he deponed that you had expressed a great
desire to break with your past life. Further interrogated where you now
were, protested ignorance, but believed you were in Leyden. That is a
close sum of his replies. I am not exactly sure that any one believed
him,” continued Mr. Rankeillor with a smile; “and in particular he so
much disrelished me expressions of mine that (in a word) he showed me to
the door. We were then at a full stand; for whatever shrewd suspicions
we might entertain, we had no shadow of probation. In the very article,
comes Captain Hoseason with the story of your drowning; whereupon all
fell through; with no consequences but concern to Mr. Campbell, injury
to my pocket, and another blot upon your uncle’s character, which could
very ill afford it. And now, Mr. Balfour,” said he, “you understand
the whole process of these matters, and can judge for yourself to what
extent I may be trusted.”

Indeed he was more pedantic than I can represent him, and placed more
scraps of Latin in his speech; but it was all uttered with a fine
geniality of eye and manner which went far to conquer my distrust.
Moreover, I could see he now treated me as if I was myself beyond a
doubt; so that first point of my identity seemed fully granted.

“Sir,” said I, “if I tell you my story, I must commit a friend’s life
to your discretion. Pass me your word it shall be sacred; and for what
touches myself, I will ask no better guarantee than just your face.”

He passed me his word very seriously. “But,” said he, “these are rather
alarming prolocutions; and if there are in your story any little jostles
to the law, I would beg you to bear in mind that I am a lawyer, and pass
lightly.”

Thereupon I told him my story from the first, he listening with his
spectacles thrust up and his eyes closed, so that I sometimes feared
he was asleep. But no such matter! he heard every word (as I found
afterward) with such quickness of hearing and precision of memory as
often surprised me. Even strange outlandish Gaelic names, heard for that
time only, he remembered and would remind me of, years after. Yet when I
called Alan Breck in full, we had an odd scene. The name of Alan had of
course rung through Scotland, with the news of the Appin murder and the
offer of the reward; and it had no sooner escaped me than the lawyer
moved in his seat and opened his eyes.

“I would name no unnecessary names, Mr. Balfour,” said he; “above all of
Highlanders, many of whom are obnoxious to the law.”

“Well, it might have been better not,” said I, “but since I have let it
slip, I may as well continue.”

“Not at all,” said Mr. Rankeillor. “I am somewhat dull of hearing, as
you may have remarked; and I am far from sure I caught the name exactly.
We will call your friend, if you please, Mr. Thomson--that there may
be no reflections. And in future, I would take some such way with any
Highlander that you may have to mention--dead or alive.”

By this, I saw he must have heard the name all too clearly, and had
already guessed I might be coming to the murder. If he chose to play
this part of ignorance, it was no matter of mine; so I smiled, said it
was no very Highland-sounding name, and consented. Through all the rest
of my story Alan was Mr. Thomson; which amused me the more, as it was a
piece of policy after his own heart. James Stewart, in like manner,
was mentioned under the style of Mr. Thomson’s kinsman; Colin Campbell
passed as a Mr. Glen; and to Cluny, when I came to that part of my tale,
I gave the name of “Mr. Jameson, a Highland chief.” It was truly the
most open farce, and I wondered that the lawyer should care to keep it
up; but, after all, it was quite in the taste of that age, when there
were two parties in the state, and quiet persons, with no very high
opinions of their own, sought out every cranny to avoid offence to
either.

“Well, well,” said the lawyer, when I had quite done, “this is a great
epic, a great Odyssey of yours. You must tell it, sir, in a sound
Latinity when your scholarship is riper; or in English if you please,
though for my part I prefer the stronger tongue. You have rolled
much; quae regio in terris--what parish in Scotland (to make a homely
translation) has not been filled with your wanderings? You have shown,
besides, a singular aptitude for getting into false positions; and, yes,
upon the whole, for behaving well in them. This Mr. Thomson seems to
me a gentleman of some choice qualities, though perhaps a trifle
bloody-minded. It would please me none the worse, if (with all his
merits) he were soused in the North Sea, for the man, Mr. David, is a
sore embarrassment. But you are doubtless quite right to adhere to him;
indubitably, he adhered to you. It comes--we may say--he was your true
companion; nor less paribus curis vestigia figit, for I dare say you
would both take an orra thought upon the gallows. Well, well, these days
are fortunately by; and I think (speaking humanly) that you are near
the end of your troubles.”

As he thus moralised on my adventures, he looked upon me with so much
humour and benignity that I could scarce contain my satisfaction. I had
been so long wandering with lawless people, and making my bed upon the
hills and under the bare sky, that to sit once more in a clean, covered
house, and to talk amicably with a gentleman in broadcloth, seemed
mighty elevations. Even as I thought so, my eye fell on my unseemly
tatters, and I was once more plunged in confusion. But the lawyer saw
and understood me. He rose, called over the stair to lay another plate,
for Mr. Balfour would stay to dinner, and led me into a bedroom in the
upper part of the house. Here he set before me water and soap, and a
comb; and laid out some clothes that belonged to his son; and here, with
another apposite tag, he left me to my toilet.




CHAPTER XXVIII

I GO IN QUEST OF MY INHERITANCE

I made what change I could in my appearance; and blithe was I to look in
the glass and find the beggarman a thing of the past, and David Balfour
come to life again. And yet I was ashamed of the change too, and, above
all, of the borrowed clothes. When I had done, Mr. Rankeillor caught
me on the stair, made me his compliments, and had me again into the
cabinet.

“Sit ye down, Mr. David,” said he, “and now that you are looking a
little more like yourself, let me see if I can find you any news. You
will be wondering, no doubt, about your father and your uncle? To be
sure it is a singular tale; and the explanation is one that I blush to
have to offer you. For,” says he, really with embarrassment, “the matter
hinges on a love affair.”

“Truly,” said I, “I cannot very well join that notion with my uncle.”

“But your uncle, Mr. David, was not always old,” replied the lawyer,
“and what may perhaps surprise you more, not always ugly. He had a fine,
gallant air; people stood in their doors to look after him, as he
went by upon a mettle horse. I have seen it with these eyes, and I
ingenuously confess, not altogether without envy; for I was a plain lad
myself and a plain man’s son; and in those days it was a case of Odi te,
qui bellus es, Sabelle.”

“It sounds like a dream,” said I.

“Ay, ay,” said the lawyer, “that is how it is with youth and age. Nor
was that all, but he had a spirit of his own that seemed to promise
great things in the future. In 1715, what must he do but run away to
join the rebels? It was your father that pursued him, found him in a
ditch, and brought him back multum gementem; to the mirth of the whole
country. However, majora canamus--the two lads fell in love, and that
with the same lady. Mr. Ebenezer, who was the admired and the beloved,
and the spoiled one, made, no doubt, mighty certain of the victory;
and when he found he had deceived himself, screamed like a peacock.
The whole country heard of it; now he lay sick at home, with his silly
family standing round the bed in tears; now he rode from public-house
to public-house, and shouted his sorrows into the lug of Tom, Dick, and
Harry. Your father, Mr. David, was a kind gentleman; but he was weak,
dolefully weak; took all this folly with a long countenance; and one
day--by your leave!--resigned the lady. She was no such fool, however;
it’s from her you must inherit your excellent good sense; and she
refused to be bandied from one to another. Both got upon their knees
to her; and the upshot of the matter for that while was that she showed
both of them the door. That was in August; dear me! the same year I came
from college. The scene must have been highly farcical.”

I thought myself it was a silly business, but I could not forget my
father had a hand in it. “Surely, sir, it had some note of tragedy,”
 said I.

“Why, no, sir, not at all,” returned the lawyer. “For tragedy implies
some ponderable matter in dispute, some dignus vindice nodus; and this
piece of work was all about the petulance of a young ass that had been
spoiled, and wanted nothing so much as to be tied up and soundly belted.
However, that was not your father’s view; and the end of it was, that
from concession to concession on your father’s part, and from one height
to another of squalling, sentimental selfishness upon your uncle’s, they
came at last to drive a sort of bargain, from whose ill results you have
recently been smarting. The one man took the lady, the other the estate.
Now, Mr. David, they talk a great deal of charity and generosity; but in
this disputable state of life, I often think the happiest consequences
seem to flow when a gentleman consults his lawyer, and takes all the law
allows him. Anyhow, this piece of Quixotry on your father’s part, as
it was unjust in itself, has brought forth a monstrous family of
injustices. Your father and mother lived and died poor folk; you were
poorly reared; and in the meanwhile, what a time it has been for the
tenants on the estate of Shaws! And I might add (if it was a matter I
cared much about) what a time for Mr. Ebenezer!”

“And yet that is certainly the strangest part of all,” said I, “that a
man’s nature should thus change.”

“True,” said Mr. Rankeillor. “And yet I imagine it was natural enough.
He could not think that he had played a handsome part. Those who knew
the story gave him the cold shoulder; those who knew it not, seeing one
brother disappear, and the other succeed in the estate, raised a cry of
murder; so that upon all sides he found himself evited. Money was all
he got by his bargain; well, he came to think the more of money. He was
selfish when he was young, he is selfish now that he is old; and the
latter end of all these pretty manners and fine feelings you have seen
for yourself.”

“Well, sir,” said I, “and in all this, what is my position?”

“The estate is yours beyond a doubt,” replied the lawyer. “It matters
nothing what your father signed, you are the heir of entail. But your
uncle is a man to fight the indefensible; and it would be likely your
identity that he would call in question. A lawsuit is always expensive,
and a family lawsuit always scandalous; besides which, if any of your
doings with your friend Mr. Thomson were to come out, we might find that
we had burned our fingers. The kidnapping, to be sure, would be a court
card upon our side, if we could only prove it. But it may be difficult
to prove; and my advice (upon the whole) is to make a very easy bargain
with your uncle, perhaps even leaving him at Shaws where he has
taken root for a quarter of a century, and contenting yourself in the
meanwhile with a fair provision.”

I told him I was very willing to be easy, and that to carry family
concerns before the public was a step from which I was naturally much
averse. In the meantime (thinking to myself) I began to see the outlines
of that scheme on which we afterwards acted.

“The great affair,” I asked, “is to bring home to him the kidnapping?”

“Surely,” said Mr. Rankeillor, “and if possible, out of court. For mark
you here, Mr. David: we could no doubt find some men of the Covenant who
would swear to your reclusion; but once they were in the box, we could
no longer check their testimony, and some word of your friend Mr.
Thomson must certainly crop out. Which (from what you have let fall) I
cannot think to be desirable.”

“Well, sir,” said I, “here is my way of it.” And I opened my plot to
him.

“But this would seem to involve my meeting the man Thomson?” says he,
when I had done.

“I think so, indeed, sir,” said I.

“Dear doctor!” cries he, rubbing his brow. “Dear doctor! No, Mr. David,
I am afraid your scheme is inadmissible. I say nothing against your
friend, Mr. Thomson: I know nothing against him; and if I did--mark
this, Mr. David!--it would be my duty to lay hands on him. Now I put it
to you: is it wise to meet? He may have matters to his charge. He may
not have told you all. His name may not be even Thomson!” cries the
lawyer, twinkling; “for some of these fellows will pick up names by the
roadside as another would gather haws.”

“You must be the judge, sir,” said I.

But it was clear my plan had taken hold upon his fancy, for he kept
musing to himself till we were called to dinner and the company of Mrs.
Rankeillor; and that lady had scarce left us again to ourselves and a
bottle of wine, ere he was back harping on my proposal. When and where
was I to meet my friend Mr. Thomson; was I sure of Mr. T.’s discretion;
supposing we could catch the old fox tripping, would I consent to such
and such a term of an agreement--these and the like questions he kept
asking at long intervals, while he thoughtfully rolled his wine upon his
tongue. When I had answered all of them, seemingly to his contentment,
he fell into a still deeper muse, even the claret being now forgotten.
Then he got a sheet of paper and a pencil, and set to work writing and
weighing every word; and at last touched a bell and had his clerk into
the chamber.

“Torrance,” said he, “I must have this written out fair against
to-night; and when it is done, you will be so kind as put on your hat
and be ready to come along with this gentleman and me, for you will
probably be wanted as a witness.”

“What, sir,” cried I, as soon as the clerk was gone, “are you to venture
it?”

“Why, so it would appear,” says he, filling his glass. “But let us speak
no more of business. The very sight of Torrance brings in my head a
little droll matter of some years ago, when I had made a tryst with the
poor oaf at the cross of Edinburgh. Each had gone his proper errand; and
when it came four o’clock, Torrance had been taking a glass and did
not know his master, and I, who had forgot my spectacles, was so blind
without them, that I give you my word I did not know my own clerk.” And
thereupon he laughed heartily.

I said it was an odd chance, and smiled out of politeness; but what held
me all the afternoon in wonder, he kept returning and dwelling on this
story, and telling it again with fresh details and laughter; so that I
began at last to be quite put out of countenance and feel ashamed for my
friend’s folly.

Towards the time I had appointed with Alan, we set out from the house,
Mr. Rankeillor and I arm in arm, and Torrance following behind with the
deed in his pocket and a covered basket in his hand. All through the
town, the lawyer was bowing right and left, and continually being
button-holed by gentlemen on matters of burgh or private business; and I
could see he was one greatly looked up to in the county. At last we were
clear of the houses, and began to go along the side of the haven and
towards the Hawes Inn and the Ferry pier, the scene of my misfortune. I
could not look upon the place without emotion, recalling how many that
had been there with me that day were now no more: Ransome taken, I could
hope, from the evil to come; Shuan passed where I dared not follow him;
and the poor souls that had gone down with the brig in her last plunge.
All these, and the brig herself, I had outlived; and come through these
hardships and fearful perils without scath. My only thought should have
been of gratitude; and yet I could not behold the place without sorrow
for others and a chill of recollected fear.

I was so thinking when, upon a sudden, Mr. Rankeillor cried out, clapped
his hand to his pockets, and began to laugh.

“Why,” he cries, “if this be not a farcical adventure! After all that I
said, I have forgot my glasses!”

At that, of course, I understood the purpose of his anecdote, and knew
that if he had left his spectacles at home, it had been done on purpose,
so that he might have the benefit of Alan’s help without the awkwardness
of recognising him. And indeed it was well thought upon; for now
(suppose things to go the very worst) how could Rankeillor swear to
my friend’s identity, or how be made to bear damaging evidence against
myself? For all that, he had been a long while of finding out his want,
and had spoken to and recognised a good few persons as we came through
the town; and I had little doubt myself that he saw reasonably well.

As soon as we were past the Hawes (where I recognised the landlord
smoking his pipe in the door, and was amazed to see him look no older)
Mr. Rankeillor changed the order of march, walking behind with Torrance
and sending me forward in the manner of a scout. I went up the hill,
whistling from time to time my Gaelic air; and at length I had the
pleasure to hear it answered and to see Alan rise from behind a bush. He
was somewhat dashed in spirits, having passed a long day alone skulking
in the county, and made but a poor meal in an alehouse near Dundas. But
at the mere sight of my clothes, he began to brighten up; and as soon as
I had told him in what a forward state our matters were and the part I
looked to him to play in what remained, he sprang into a new man.

“And that is a very good notion of yours,” says he; “and I dare to say
that you could lay your hands upon no better man to put it through than
Alan Breck. It is not a thing (mark ye) that any one could do, but takes
a gentleman of penetration. But it sticks in my head your lawyer-man
will be somewhat wearying to see me,” says Alan.

Accordingly I cried and waved on Mr. Rankeillor, who came up alone and
was presented to my friend, Mr. Thomson.

“Mr. Thomson, I am pleased to meet you,” said he. “But I have forgotten
my glasses; and our friend, Mr. David here” (clapping me on the
shoulder), “will tell you that I am little better than blind, and that
you must not be surprised if I pass you by to-morrow.”

This he said, thinking that Alan would be pleased; but the Highlandman’s
vanity was ready to startle at a less matter than that.

“Why, sir,” says he, stiffly, “I would say it mattered the less as we
are met here for a particular end, to see justice done to Mr. Balfour;
and by what I can see, not very likely to have much else in common. But
I accept your apology, which was a very proper one to make.”

“And that is more than I could look for, Mr. Thomson,” said Rankeillor,
heartily. “And now as you and I are the chief actors in this enterprise,
I think we should come into a nice agreement; to which end, I propose
that you should lend me your arm, for (what with the dusk and the want
of my glasses) I am not very clear as to the path; and as for you, Mr.
David, you will find Torrance a pleasant kind of body to speak with.
Only let me remind you, it’s quite needless he should hear more of your
adventures or those of--ahem--Mr. Thomson.”

Accordingly these two went on ahead in very close talk, and Torrance and
I brought up the rear.

Night was quite come when we came in view of the house of Shaws. Ten
had been gone some time; it was dark and mild, with a pleasant, rustling
wind in the south-west that covered the sound of our approach; and as we
drew near we saw no glimmer of light in any portion of the building. It
seemed my uncle was already in bed, which was indeed the best thing for
our arrangements. We made our last whispered consultations some fifty
yards away; and then the lawyer and Torrance and I crept quietly up and
crouched down beside the corner of the house; and as soon as we were
in our places, Alan strode to the door without concealment and began to
knock.




CHAPTER XXIX

I COME INTO MY KINGDOM

For some time Alan volleyed upon the door, and his knocking only roused
the echoes of the house and neighbourhood. At last, however, I could
hear the noise of a window gently thrust up, and knew that my uncle
had come to his observatory. By what light there was, he would see Alan
standing, like a dark shadow, on the steps; the three witnesses were
hidden quite out of his view; so that there was nothing to alarm an
honest man in his own house. For all that, he studied his visitor awhile
in silence, and when he spoke his voice had a quaver of misgiving.

“What’s this?” says he. “This is nae kind of time of night for decent
folk; and I hae nae trokings* wi’ night-hawks. What brings ye here? I
have a blunderbush.”

     * Dealings.

“Is that yoursel’, Mr. Balfour?” returned Alan, stepping back and
looking up into the darkness. “Have a care of that blunderbuss; they’re
nasty things to burst.”

“What brings ye here? and whae are ye?” says my uncle, angrily.

“I have no manner of inclination to rowt out my name to the
country-side,” said Alan; “but what brings me here is another story,
being more of your affair than mine; and if ye’re sure it’s what ye
would like, I’ll set it to a tune and sing it to you.”

“And what is’t?” asked my uncle.

“David,” says Alan.

“What was that?” cried my uncle, in a mighty changed voice.

“Shall I give ye the rest of the name, then?” said Alan.

There was a pause; and then, “I’m thinking I’ll better let ye in,” says
my uncle, doubtfully.

“I dare say that,” said Alan; “but the point is, Would I go? Now I will
tell you what I am thinking. I am thinking that it is here upon this
doorstep that we must confer upon this business; and it shall be here or
nowhere at all whatever; for I would have you to understand that I am as
stiffnecked as yoursel’, and a gentleman of better family.”

This change of note disconcerted Ebenezer; he was a little while
digesting it, and then says he, “Weel, weel, what must be must,” and
shut the window. But it took him a long time to get down-stairs, and a
still longer to undo the fastenings, repenting (I dare say) and taken
with fresh claps of fear at every second step and every bolt and bar. At
last, however, we heard the creak of the hinges, and it seems my uncle
slipped gingerly out and (seeing that Alan had stepped back a pace or
two) sate him down on the top doorstep with the blunderbuss ready in his
hands.

“And, now” says he, “mind I have my blunderbush, and if ye take a step
nearer ye’re as good as deid.”

“And a very civil speech,” says Alan, “to be sure.”

“Na,” says my uncle, “but this is no a very chanty kind of a proceeding,
and I’m bound to be prepared. And now that we understand each other,
ye’ll can name your business.”

“Why,” says Alan, “you that are a man of so much understanding, will
doubtless have perceived that I am a Hieland gentleman. My name has nae
business in my story; but the county of my friends is no very far from
the Isle of Mull, of which ye will have heard. It seems there was a
ship lost in those parts; and the next day a gentleman of my family was
seeking wreck-wood for his fire along the sands, when he came upon a lad
that was half drowned. Well, he brought him to; and he and some other
gentleman took and clapped him in an auld, ruined castle, where from
that day to this he has been a great expense to my friends. My friends
are a wee wild-like, and not so particular about the law as some that
I could name; and finding that the lad owned some decent folk, and was
your born nephew, Mr. Balfour, they asked me to give ye a bit call and
confer upon the matter. And I may tell ye at the off-go, unless we can
agree upon some terms, ye are little likely to set eyes upon him. For my
friends,” added Alan, simply, “are no very well off.”

My uncle cleared his throat. “I’m no very caring,” says he. “He wasnae a
good lad at the best of it, and I’ve nae call to interfere.”

“Ay, ay,” said Alan, “I see what ye would be at: pretending ye don’t
care, to make the ransom smaller.”

“Na,” said my uncle, “it’s the mere truth. I take nae manner of interest
in the lad, and I’ll pay nae ransome, and ye can make a kirk and a mill
of him for what I care.”

“Hoot, sir,” says Alan. “Blood’s thicker than water, in the deil’s name!
Ye cannae desert your brother’s son for the fair shame of it; and if
ye did, and it came to be kennt, ye wouldnae be very popular in your
country-side, or I’m the more deceived.”

“I’m no just very popular the way it is,” returned Ebenezer; “and I
dinnae see how it would come to be kennt. No by me, onyway; nor yet by
you or your friends. So that’s idle talk, my buckie,” says he.

“Then it’ll have to be David that tells it,” said Alan.

“How that?” says my uncle, sharply.

“Ou, just this way,” says Alan. “My friends would doubtless keep your
nephew as long as there was any likelihood of siller to be made of it,
but if there was nane, I am clearly of opinion they would let him gang
where he pleased, and be damned to him!”

“Ay, but I’m no very caring about that either,” said my uncle. “I
wouldnae be muckle made up with that.”

“I was thinking that,” said Alan.

“And what for why?” asked Ebenezer.

“Why, Mr. Balfour,” replied Alan, “by all that I could hear, there were
two ways of it: either ye liked David and would pay to get him back; or
else ye had very good reasons for not wanting him, and would pay for us
to keep him. It seems it’s not the first; well then, it’s the second;
and blythe am I to ken it, for it should be a pretty penny in my pocket
and the pockets of my friends.”

“I dinnae follow ye there,” said my uncle.

“No?” said Alan. “Well, see here: you dinnae want the lad back; well,
what do ye want done with him, and how much will ye pay?”

My uncle made no answer, but shifted uneasily on his seat.

“Come, sir,” cried Alan. “I would have you to ken that I am a gentleman;
I bear a king’s name; I am nae rider to kick my shanks at your hall
door. Either give me an answer in civility, and that out of hand; or by
the top of Glencoe, I will ram three feet of iron through your vitals.”

“Eh, man,” cried my uncle, scrambling to his feet, “give me a meenit!
What’s like wrong with ye? I’m just a plain man and nae dancing master;
and I’m tryin to be as ceevil as it’s morally possible. As for that wild
talk, it’s fair disrepitable. Vitals, says you! And where would I be
with my blunderbush?” he snarled.

“Powder and your auld hands are but as the snail to the swallow against
the bright steel in the hands of Alan,” said the other. “Before your
jottering finger could find the trigger, the hilt would dirl on your
breast-bane.”

“Eh, man, whae’s denying it?” said my uncle. “Pit it as ye please, hae’t
your ain way; I’ll do naething to cross ye. Just tell me what like ye’ll
be wanting, and ye’ll see that we’ll can agree fine.”

“Troth, sir,” said Alan, “I ask for nothing but plain dealing. In two
words: do ye want the lad killed or kept?”

“O, sirs!” cried Ebenezer. “O, sirs, me! that’s no kind of language!”

“Killed or kept!” repeated Alan.

“O, keepit, keepit!” wailed my uncle. “We’ll have nae bloodshed, if you
please.”

“Well,” says Alan, “as ye please; that’ll be the dearer.”

“The dearer?” cries Ebenezer. “Would ye fyle your hands wi’ crime?”

“Hoot!” said Alan, “they’re baith crime, whatever! And the killing’s
easier, and quicker, and surer. Keeping the lad’ll be a fashious* job, a
fashious, kittle business.”

     * Troublesome.

“I’ll have him keepit, though,” returned my uncle. “I never had naething
to do with onything morally wrong; and I’m no gaun to begin to pleasure
a wild Hielandman.”

“Ye’re unco scrupulous,” sneered Alan.

“I’m a man o’ principle,” said Ebenezer, simply; “and if I have to pay
for it, I’ll have to pay for it. And besides,” says he, “ye forget the
lad’s my brother’s son.”

“Well, well,” said Alan, “and now about the price. It’s no very easy for
me to set a name upon it; I would first have to ken some small matters.
I would have to ken, for instance, what ye gave Hoseason at the first
off-go?”

“Hoseason!” cries my uncle, struck aback. “What for?”

“For kidnapping David,” says Alan.

“It’s a lee, it’s a black lee!” cried my uncle. “He was never kidnapped.
He leed in his throat that tauld ye that. Kidnapped? He never was!”

“That’s no fault of mine nor yet of yours,” said Alan; “nor yet of
Hoseason’s, if he’s a man that can be trusted.”

“What do ye mean?” cried Ebenezer. “Did Hoseason tell ye?”

“Why, ye donnered auld runt, how else would I ken?” cried Alan.
“Hoseason and me are partners; we gang shares; so ye can see for
yoursel’ what good ye can do leeing. And I must plainly say ye drove a
fool’s bargain when ye let a man like the sailor-man so far forward in
your private matters. But that’s past praying for; and ye must lie on
your bed the way ye made it. And the point in hand is just this: what
did ye pay him?”

“Has he tauld ye himsel’?” asked my uncle.

“That’s my concern,” said Alan.

“Weel,” said my uncle, “I dinnae care what he said, he leed, and the
solemn God’s truth is this, that I gave him twenty pound. But I’ll be
perfec’ly honest with ye: forby that, he was to have the selling of the
lad in Caroliny, whilk would be as muckle mair, but no from my pocket,
ye see.”

“Thank you, Mr. Thomson. That will do excellently well,” said the
lawyer, stepping forward; and then mighty civilly, “Good-evening, Mr.
Balfour,” said he.

And, “Good-evening, Uncle Ebenezer,” said I.

And, “It’s a braw nicht, Mr. Balfour,” added Torrance.

Never a word said my uncle, neither black nor white; but just sat where
he was on the top door-step and stared upon us like a man turned to
stone. Alan filched away his blunderbuss; and the lawyer, taking him
by the arm, plucked him up from the doorstep, led him into the kitchen,
whither we all followed, and set him down in a chair beside the hearth,
where the fire was out and only a rush-light burning.

There we all looked upon him for a while, exulting greatly in our
success, but yet with a sort of pity for the man’s shame.

“Come, come, Mr. Ebenezer,” said the lawyer, “you must not be
down-hearted, for I promise you we shall make easy terms. In the
meanwhile give us the cellar key, and Torrance shall draw us a bottle
of your father’s wine in honour of the event.” Then, turning to me and
taking me by the hand, “Mr. David,” says he, “I wish you all joy in your
good fortune, which I believe to be deserved.” And then to Alan, with
a spice of drollery, “Mr. Thomson, I pay you my compliment; it was
most artfully conducted; but in one point you somewhat outran my
comprehension. Do I understand your name to be James? or Charles? or is
it George, perhaps?”

“And why should it be any of the three, sir?” quoth Alan, drawing
himself up, like one who smelt an offence.

“Only, sir, that you mentioned a king’s name,” replied Rankeillor; “and
as there has never yet been a King Thomson, or his fame at least has
never come my way, I judged you must refer to that you had in baptism.”

This was just the stab that Alan would feel keenest, and I am free to
confess he took it very ill. Not a word would he answer, but stepped off
to the far end of the kitchen, and sat down and sulked; and it was not
till I stepped after him, and gave him my hand, and thanked him by title
as the chief spring of my success, that he began to smile a bit, and was
at last prevailed upon to join our party.

By that time we had the fire lighted, and a bottle of wine uncorked; a
good supper came out of the basket, to which Torrance and I and Alan
set ourselves down; while the lawyer and my uncle passed into the next
chamber to consult. They stayed there closeted about an hour; at the end
of which period they had come to a good understanding, and my uncle and
I set our hands to the agreement in a formal manner. By the terms
of this, my uncle bound himself to satisfy Rankeillor as to his
intromissions, and to pay me two clear thirds of the yearly income of
Shaws.

So the beggar in the ballad had come home; and when I lay down that
night on the kitchen chests, I was a man of means and had a name in the
country. Alan and Torrance and Rankeillor slept and snored on their hard
beds; but for me who had lain out under heaven and upon dirt and stones,
so many days and nights, and often with an empty belly, and in fear
of death, this good change in my case unmanned me more than any of the
former evil ones; and I lay till dawn, looking at the fire on the roof
and planning the future.




CHAPTER XXX

GOOD-BYE

So far as I was concerned myself, I had come to port; but I had still
Alan, to whom I was so much beholden, on my hands; and I felt besides a
heavy charge in the matter of the murder and James of the Glens. On both
these heads I unbosomed to Rankeillor the next morning, walking to and
fro about six of the clock before the house of Shaws, and with nothing
in view but the fields and woods that had been my ancestors’ and were
now mine. Even as I spoke on these grave subjects, my eye would take a
glad bit of a run over the prospect, and my heart jump with pride.

About my clear duty to my friend, the lawyer had no doubt. I must help
him out of the county at whatever risk; but in the case of James, he was
of a different mind.

“Mr. Thomson,” says he, “is one thing, Mr. Thomson’s kinsman quite
another. I know little of the facts, but I gather that a great noble
(whom we will call, if you like, the D. of A.)* has some concern and
is even supposed to feel some animosity in the matter. The D. of A. is
doubtless an excellent nobleman; but, Mr. David, timeo qui nocuere deos.
If you interfere to balk his vengeance, you should remember there is
one way to shut your testimony out; and that is to put you in the dock.
There, you would be in the same pickle as Mr. Thomson’s kinsman. You
will object that you are innocent; well, but so is he. And to be tried
for your life before a Highland jury, on a Highland quarrel and with
a Highland Judge upon the bench, would be a brief transition to the
gallows.”

     * The Duke of Argyle.

Now I had made all these reasonings before and found no very good reply
to them; so I put on all the simplicity I could. “In that case, sir,”
 said I, “I would just have to be hanged--would I not?”

“My dear boy,” cries he, “go in God’s name, and do what you think is
right. It is a poor thought that at my time of life I should be advising
you to choose the safe and shameful; and I take it back with an apology.
Go and do your duty; and be hanged, if you must, like a gentleman. There
are worse things in the world than to be hanged.”

“Not many, sir,” said I, smiling.

“Why, yes, sir,” he cried, “very many. And it would be ten times better
for your uncle (to go no farther afield) if he were dangling decently
upon a gibbet.”

Thereupon he turned into the house (still in a great fervour of mind,
so that I saw I had pleased him heartily) and there he wrote me two
letters, making his comments on them as he wrote.

“This,” says he, “is to my bankers, the British Linen Company, placing a
credit to your name. Consult Mr. Thomson, he will know of ways; and
you, with this credit, can supply the means. I trust you will be a good
husband of your money; but in the affair of a friend like Mr. Thomson,
I would be even prodigal. Then for his kinsman, there is no better way
than that you should seek the Advocate, tell him your tale, and offer
testimony; whether he may take it or not, is quite another matter, and
will turn on the D. of A. Now, that you may reach the Lord Advocate well
recommended, I give you here a letter to a namesake of your own, the
learned Mr. Balfour of Pilrig, a man whom I esteem. It will look better
that you should be presented by one of your own name; and the laird of
Pilrig is much looked up to in the Faculty and stands well with Lord
Advocate Grant. I would not trouble him, if I were you, with any
particulars; and (do you know?) I think it would be needless to refer to
Mr. Thomson. Form yourself upon the laird, he is a good model; when you
deal with the Advocate, be discreet; and in all these matters, may the
Lord guide you, Mr. David!”

Thereupon he took his farewell, and set out with Torrance for the Ferry,
while Alan and I turned our faces for the city of Edinburgh. As we went
by the footpath and beside the gateposts and the unfinished lodge, we
kept looking back at the house of my fathers. It stood there, bare and
great and smokeless, like a place not lived in; only in one of the top
windows, there was the peak of a nightcap bobbing up and down and back
and forward, like the head of a rabbit from a burrow. I had little
welcome when I came, and less kindness while I stayed; but at least I
was watched as I went away.

Alan and I went slowly forward upon our way, having little heart either
to walk or speak. The same thought was uppermost in both, that we were
near the time of our parting; and remembrance of all the bygone days
sate upon us sorely. We talked indeed of what should be done; and it
was resolved that Alan should keep to the county, biding now here, now
there, but coming once in the day to a particular place where I might be
able to communicate with him, either in my own person or by messenger.
In the meanwhile, I was to seek out a lawyer, who was an Appin Stewart,
and a man therefore to be wholly trusted; and it should be his part to
find a ship and to arrange for Alan’s safe embarkation. No sooner was
this business done, than the words seemed to leave us; and though I
would seek to jest with Alan under the name of Mr. Thomson, and he with
me on my new clothes and my estate, you could feel very well that we
were nearer tears than laughter.

We came the by-way over the hill of Corstorphine; and when we got
near to the place called Rest-and-be-Thankful, and looked down on
Corstorphine bogs and over to the city and the castle on the hill, we
both stopped, for we both knew without a word said that we had come to
where our ways parted. Here he repeated to me once again what had been
agreed upon between us: the address of the lawyer, the daily hour at
which Alan might be found, and the signals that were to be made by any
that came seeking him. Then I gave what money I had (a guinea or two of
Rankeillor’s) so that he should not starve in the meanwhile; and then we
stood a space, and looked over at Edinburgh in silence.

“Well, good-bye,” said Alan, and held out his left hand.

“Good-bye,” said I, and gave the hand a little grasp, and went off down
hill.

Neither one of us looked the other in the face, nor so long as he was in
my view did I take one back glance at the friend I was leaving. But as
I went on my way to the city, I felt so lost and lonesome, that I could
have found it in my heart to sit down by the dyke, and cry and weep like
any baby.

It was coming near noon when I passed in by the West Kirk and the
Grassmarket into the streets of the capital. The huge height of the
buildings, running up to ten and fifteen storeys, the narrow arched
entries that continually vomited passengers, the wares of the merchants
in their windows, the hubbub and endless stir, the foul smells and the
fine clothes, and a hundred other particulars too small to mention,
struck me into a kind of stupor of surprise, so that I let the crowd
carry me to and fro; and yet all the time what I was thinking of was
Alan at Rest-and-be-Thankful; and all the time (although you would think
I would not choose but be delighted with these braws and novelties)
there was a cold gnawing in my inside like a remorse for something
wrong.

The hand of Providence brought me in my drifting to the very doors of
the British Linen Company’s bank.
",kidnapped,Robert Louis Stevenson
"﻿A BEGGAR ON HORSEBACK


The 25th day of August, 1751, about two in the afternoon, I, David
Balfour, came forth of the British Linen Company, a porter attending me
with a bag of money, and some of the chief of these merchants bowing me
from their doors. Two days before, and even so late as yestermorning, I
was like a beggar-man by the wayside, clad in rags, brought down to my
last shillings, my companion a condemned traitor, a price set on my own
head for a crime with the news of which the country rang. To-day I was
served heir to my position in life, a landed laird, a bank porter by me
carrying my gold, recommendations in my pocket, and (in the words of
the saying) the ball directly at my foot.

There were two circumstances that served me as ballast to so much sail.
The first was the very difficult and deadly business I had still to
handle; the second, the place that I was in. The tall, black city, and
the numbers and movement and noise of so many folk, made a new world
for me, after the moorland braes, the sea-sands and the still
country-sides that I had frequented up to then. The throng of the
citizens in particular abashed me. Rankeillor’s son was short and small
in the girth; his clothes scarce held on me; and it was plain I was ill
qualified to strut in the front of a bank-porter. It was plain, if I
did so, I should but set folk laughing, and (what was worse in my case)
set them asking questions. So that I behooved to come by some clothes
of my own, and in the meanwhile to walk by the porter’s side, and put
my hand on his arm as though we were a pair of friends.

At a merchant’s in the Luckenbooths I had myself fitted out: none too
fine, for I had no idea to appear like a beggar on horseback; but
comely and responsible, so that servants should respect me. Thence to
an armourer’s, where I got a plain sword, to suit with my degree in
life. I felt safer with the weapon, though (for one so ignorant of
defence) it might be called an added danger. The porter, who was
naturally a man of some experience, judged my accoutrement to be well
chosen.

“Naething kenspeckle,”[1] said he; “plain, dacent claes. As for the
rapier, nae doubt it sits wi’ your degree; but an I had been you, I
would has waired my siller better-gates than that.” And he proposed I
should buy winter-hosen from a wife in the Cowgate-back, that was a
cousin of his own, and made them “extraordinar endurable.”

But I had other matters on my hand more pressing. Here I was in this
old, black city, which was for all the world like a rabbit-warren, not
only by the number of its indwellers, but the complication of its
passages and holes. It was, indeed, a place where no stranger had a
chance to find a friend, let be another stranger. Suppose him even to
hit on the right close, people dwelt so thronged in these tall houses,
he might very well seek a day before he chanced on the right door. The
ordinary course was to hire a lad they called a _caddie_, who was like
a guide or pilot, led you where you had occasion, and (your errands
being done) brought you again where you were lodging. But these
caddies, being always employed in the same sort of services, and having
it for obligation to be well informed of every house and person in the
city, had grown to form a brotherhood of spies; and I knew from tales
of Mr. Campbell’s how they communicated one with another, what a rage
of curiosity they conceived as to their employer’s business, and how
they were like eyes and fingers to the police. It would be a piece of
little wisdom, the way I was now placed, to take such a ferret to my
tails. I had three visits to make, all immediately needful: to my
kinsman Mr. Balfour of Pilrig, to Stewart the Writer that was Appin’s
agent, and to William Grant Esquire of Prestongrange, Lord Advocate of
Scotland. Mr. Balfour’s was a non-committal visit; and besides (Pilrig
being in the country) I made bold to find the way to it myself, with
the help of my two legs and a Scots tongue. But the rest were in a
different case. Not only was the visit to Appin’s agent, in the midst
of the cry about the Appin murder, dangerous in itself, but it was
highly inconsistent with the other. I was like to have a bad enough
time of it with my Lord Advocate Grant, the best of ways; but to go to
him hot-foot from Appin’s agent, was little likely to mend my own
affairs, and might prove the mere ruin of friend Alan’s. The whole
thing, besides, gave me a look of running with the hare and hunting
with the hounds that was little to my fancy. I determined, therefore,
to be done at once with Mr. Stewart and the whole Jacobitical side of
my business, and to profit for that purpose by the guidance of the
porter at my side. But it chanced I had scarce given him the address,
when there came a sprinkle of rain—nothing to hurt, only for my new
clothes—and we took shelter under a pend at the head of a close or
alley.

Being strange to what I saw, I stepped a little farther in. The narrow
paved way descended swiftly. Prodigious tall houses sprang upon each
side and bulged out, one storey beyond another, as they rose. At the
top only a ribbon of sky showed in. By what I could spy in the windows,
and by the respectable persons that passed out and in, I saw the houses
to be very well occupied; and the whole appearance of the place
interested me like a tale.

I was still gazing, when there came a sudden brisk tramp of feet in
time and clash of steel behind me. Turning quickly, I was aware of a
party of armed soldiers, and, in their midst, a tall man in a great
coat. He walked with a stoop that was like a piece of courtesy, genteel
and insinuating: he waved his hands plausibly as he went, and his face
was sly and handsome. I thought his eye took me in, but could not meet
it. This procession went by to a door in the close, which a serving-man
in a fine livery set open; and two of the soldier-lads carried the
prisoner within, the rest lingering with their firelocks by the door.

There can nothing pass in the streets of a city without some following
of idle folk and children. It was so now; but the more part melted away
incontinent until but three were left. One was a girl; she was dressed
like a lady, and had a screen of the Drummond colours on her head; but
her comrades or (I should say) followers were ragged gillies, such as I
had seen the matches of by the dozen in my Highland journey. They all
spoke together earnestly in Gaelic, the sound of which was pleasant in
my ears for the sake of Alan; and, though the rain was by again, and my
porter plucked at me to be going, I even drew nearer where they were,
to listen. The lady scolded sharply, the others making apologies and
cringeing before her, so that I made sure she was come of a chief’s
house. All the while the three of them sought in their pockets, and by
what I could make out, they had the matter of half a farthing among the
party; which made me smile a little to see all Highland folk alike for
fine obeisances and empty sporrans.

It chanced the girl turned suddenly about, so that I saw her face for
the first time. There is no greater wonder than the way the face of a
young woman fits in a man’s mind, and stays there, and he could never
tell you why; it just seems it was the thing he wanted. She had
wonderful bright eyes like stars, and I daresay the eyes had a part in
it; but what I remember the most clearly was the way her lips were a
trifle open as she turned. And, whatever was the cause, I stood there
staring like a fool. On her side, as she had not known there was anyone
so near, she looked at me a little longer, and perhaps with more
surprise, than was entirely civil.

It went through my country head she might be wondering at my new
clothes; with that, I blushed to my hair, and at the sight of my
colouring it is to be supposed she drew her own conclusions, for she
moved her gillies farther down the close, and they fell again to this
dispute, where I could hear no more of it.

I had often admired a lassie before then, if scarce so sudden and
strong; and it was rather my disposition to withdraw than to come
forward, for I was much in fear of mockery from the womenkind. You
would have thought I had now all the more reason to pursue my common
practice, since I had met this young lady in the city street, seemingly
following a prisoner, and accompanied with two very ragged
indecent-like Highlandmen. But there was here a different ingredient;
it was plain the girl thought I had been prying in her secrets; and
with my new clothes and sword, and at the top of my new fortunes, this
was more than I could swallow. The beggar on horseback could not bear
to be thrust down so low, or, at least of it, not by this young lady.

I followed, accordingly, and took off my new hat to her the best that I
was able.

“Madam,” said I, “I think it only fair to myself to let you understand
I have no Gaelic. It is true I was listening, for I have friends of my
own across the Highland line, and the sound of that tongue comes
friendly; but for your private affairs, if you had spoken Greek, I
might have had more guess at them.”

She made me a little, distant curtsey. “There is no harm done,” said
she, with a pretty accent, most like the English (but more agreeable).
“A cat may look at a king.”

“I do not mean to offend,” said I. “I have no skill of city manners; I
never before this day set foot inside the doors of Edinburgh. Take me
for a country lad—it’s what I am; and I would rather I told you than
you found it out.”

“Indeed, it will be a very unusual thing for strangers to be speaking
to each other on the causeway,” she replied. “But if you are landward
[2] bred it will be different. I am as landward as yourself; I am
Highland, as you see, and think myself the farther from my home.”

“It is not yet a week since I passed the line,” said I. “Less than a
week ago I was on the braes of Balwhidder.”

“Balwhither?” she cries. “Come ye from Balwhither! The name of it makes
all there is of me rejoice. You will not have been long there, and not
known some of our friends or family?”

“I lived with a very honest, kind man called Duncan Dhu Maclaren,” I
replied.

“Well, I know Duncan, and you give him the true name!” she said; “and
if he is an honest man, his wife is honest indeed.”

“Ay,” said I, “they are fine people, and the place is a bonny place.”

“Where in the great world is such another!” she cries; “I am loving the
smell of that place and the roots that grow there.”

I was infinitely taken with the spirit of the maid. “I could be wishing
I had brought you a spray of that heather,” says I. “And, though I did
ill to speak with you at the first, now it seems we have common
acquaintance, I make it my petition you will not forget me. David
Balfour is the name I am known by. This is my lucky day, when I have
just come into a landed estate, and am not very long out of a deadly
peril. I wish you would keep my name in mind for the sake of
Balwhidder,” said I, “and I will yours for the sake of my lucky day.”

“My name is not spoken,” she replied, with a great deal of haughtiness.
“More than a hundred years it has not gone upon men’s tongues, save for
a blink. I am nameless, like the Folk of Peace. [3] Catriona Drummond
is the one I use.”

Now indeed I knew where I was standing. In all broad Scotland there was
but the one name proscribed, and that was the name of the Macgregors.
Yet so far from fleeing this undesirable acquaintancy, I plunged the
deeper in.

“I have been sitting with one who was in the same case with yourself,”
said I, “and I think he will be one of your friends. They called him
Robin Oig.”

“Did ye so?” cries she. “Ye met Rob?”

“I passed the night with him,” said I.

“He is a fowl of the night,” said she.

“There was a set of pipes there,” I went on, “so you may judge if the
time passed.”

“You should be no enemy, at all events,” said she. “That was his
brother there a moment since, with the red soldiers round him. It is
him that I call father.”

“Is it so?” cried I. “Are you a daughter of James More’s?”

“All the daughter that he has,” says she: “the daughter of a prisoner;
that I should forget it so, even for one hour, to talk with strangers!”

Here one of the gillies addressed her in what he had of English, to
know what “she” (meaning by that himself) was to do about “ta
sneeshin.” I took some note of him for a short, bandy-legged,
red-haired, big-headed man, that I was to know more of to my cost.

“There can be none the day, Neil,” she replied. “How will you get
‘sneeshin,’ wanting siller! It will teach you another time to be more
careful; and I think James More will not be very well pleased with Neil
of the Tom.”

“Miss Drummond,” I said, “I told you I was in my lucky day. Here I am,
and a bank-porter at my tail. And remember I have had the hospitality
of your own country of Balwhidder.”

“It was not one of my people gave it,” said she.

“Ah, well,” said I, “but I am owing your uncle at least for some
springs upon the pipes. Besides which, I have offered myself to be your
friend, and you have been so forgetful that you did not refuse me in
the proper time.”

“If it had been a great sum, it might have done you honour,” said she;
“but I will tell you what this is. James More lies shackled in prison;
but this time past they will be bringing him down here daily to the
Advocate’s. . . .”

“The Advocate’s!” I cried. “Is that . . . ?”

“It is the house of the Lord Advocate Grant of Prestongrange,” said
she. “There they bring my father one time and another, for what purpose
I have no thought in my mind; but it seems there is some hope dawned
for him. All this same time they will not let me be seeing him, nor yet
him write; and we wait upon the King’s street to catch him; and now we
give him his snuff as he goes by, and now something else. And here is
this son of trouble, Neil, son of Duncan, has lost my four-penny piece
that was to buy that snuff, and James More must go wanting, and will
think his daughter has forgotten him.”

I took sixpence from my pocket, gave it to Neil, and bade him go about
his errand. Then to her, “That sixpence came with me by Balwhidder,”
said I.

“Ah!” she said, “you are a friend to the Gregara!”

“I would not like to deceive you, either,” said I. “I know very little
of the Gregara and less of James More and his doings, but since the
while I have been standing in this close, I seem to know something of
yourself; and if you will just say ‘a friend to Miss Catriona’ I will
see you are the less cheated.”

“The one cannot be without the other,” said she.

“I will even try,” said I.

“And what will you be thinking of myself!” she cried, “to be holding my
hand to the first stranger!”

“I am thinking nothing but that you are a good daughter,” said I.

“I must not be without repaying it,” she said; “where is it you stop!”

“To tell the truth, I am stopping nowhere yet,” said I, “being not full
three hours in the city; but if you will give me your direction, I will
be so bold as come seeking my sixpence for myself.”

“Will I can trust you for that?” she asked.

“You need have little fear,” said I.

“James More could not bear it else,” said she. “I stop beyond the
village of Dean, on the north side of the water, with Mrs.
Drummond-Ogilvy of Allardyce, who is my near friend and will be glad to
thank you.”

“You are to see me, then, so soon as what I have to do permits,” said
I; and, the remembrance of Alan rolling in again upon my mind, I made
haste to say farewell.

I could not but think, even as I did so, that we had made extraordinary
free upon short acquaintance, and that a really wise young lady would
have shown herself more backward. I think it was the bank-porter that
put me from this ungallant train of thought.

“I thoucht ye had been a lad of some kind o’ sense,” he began, shooting
out his lips. “Ye’re no likely to gang far this gate. A fule and his
siller’s shune parted. Eh, but ye’re a green callant!” he cried, “an’ a
veecious, tae! Cleikin’ up wi’ baubeejoes!”

“If you dare to speak of the young lady. . . ” I began.

“Leddy!” he cried. “Haud us and safe us, whatten leddy? Ca’ _thon_ a
leddy? The toun’s fu’ o’ them. Leddies! Man, its weel seen ye’re no
very acquant in Embro!”

A clap of anger took me.

“Here,” said I, “lead me where I told you, and keep your foul mouth
shut!”

He did not wholly obey me, for, though he no more addressed me
directly, he very impudent sang at me as he went in a manner of
innuendo, and with an exceedingly ill voice and ear—

“As Mally Lee cam doun the street, her capuchin did flee,
She cuist a look ahint her to see her negligee.
And we’re a’ gaun east and wast, we’re a’ gann ajee,
We’re a’ gaun east and wast courtin’ Mally Lee.”




CHAPTER II.
THE HIGHLAND WRITER


Mr. Charles Stewart the Writer dwelt at the top of the longest stair
ever mason set a hand to; fifteen flights of it, no less; and when I
had come to his door, and a clerk had opened it, and told me his master
was within, I had scarce breath enough to send my porter packing.

“Awa’ east and west wi’ ye!” said I, took the money bag out of his
hands, and followed the clerk in.

The outer room was an office with the clerk’s chair at a table spread
with law papers. In the inner chamber, which opened from it, a little
brisk man sat poring on a deed, from which he scarce raised his eyes on
my entrance; indeed, he still kept his finger in the place, as though
prepared to show me out and fall again to his studies. This pleased me
little enough; and what pleased me less, I thought the clerk was in a
good posture to overhear what should pass between us.

I asked if he was Mr. Charles Stewart the Writer.

“The same,” says he; “and, if the question is equally fair, who may you
be yourself?”

“You never heard tell of my name nor of me either,” said I, “but I
bring you a token from a friend that you know well. That you know
well,” I repeated, lowering my voice, “but maybe are not just so keen
to hear from at this present being. And the bits of business that I
have to propone to you are rather in the nature of being confidential.
In short, I would like to think we were quite private.”

He rose without more words, casting down his paper like a man
ill-pleased, sent forth his clerk of an errand, and shut to the
house-door behind him.

“Now, sir,” said he, returning, “speak out your mind and fear nothing;
though before you begin,” he cries out, “I tell you mine misgives me! I
tell you beforehand, ye’re either a Stewart or a Stewart sent ye. A
good name it is, and one it would ill-become my father’s son to
lightly. But I begin to grue at the sound of it.”

“My name is called Balfour,” said I, “David Balfour of Shaws. As for
him that sent me, I will let his token speak.” And I showed the silver
button.

“Put it in your pocket, sir!” cries he. “Ye need name no names. The
deevil’s buckie, I ken the button of him! And de’il hae’t! Where is he
now!”

I told him I knew not where Alan was, but he had some sure place (or
thought he had) about the north side, where he was to lie until a ship
was found for him; and how and where he had appointed to be spoken
with.

“It’s been always my opinion that I would hang in a tow for this family
of mine,” he cried, “and, dod! I believe the day’s come now! Get a ship
for him, quot’ he! And who’s to pay for it? The man’s daft!”

“That is my part of the affair, Mr. Stewart,” said I. “Here is a bag of
good money, and if more be wanted, more is to be had where it came
from.”

“I needn’t ask your politics,” said he.

“Ye need not,” said I, smiling, “for I’m as big a Whig as grows.”

“Stop a bit, stop a bit,” says Mr. Stewart. “What’s all this? A Whig?
Then why are you here with Alan’s button? and what kind of a black-foot
traffic is this that I find ye out in, Mr. Whig? Here is a forfeited
rebel and an accused murderer, with two hundred pounds on his life, and
ye ask me to meddle in his business, and then tell me ye’re a Whig! I
have no mind of any such Whigs before, though I’ve kent plenty of
them.”

“He’s a forfeited rebel, the more’s the pity,” said I, “for the man’s
my friend. I can only wish he had been better guided. And an accused
murderer, that he is too, for his misfortune; but wrongfully accused.”

“I hear you say so,” said Stewart.

“More than you are to hear me say so, before long,” said I. “Alan Breck
is innocent, and so is James.”

“Oh!” says he, “the two cases hang together. If Alan is out, James can
never be in.”

Hereupon I told him briefly of my acquaintance with Alan, of the
accident that brought me present at the Appin murder, and the various
passages of our escape among the heather, and my recovery of my estate.
“So, sir, you have now the whole train of these events,” I went on,
“and can see for yourself how I come to be so much mingled up with the
affairs of your family and friends, which (for all of our sakes) I wish
had been plainer and less bloody. You can see for yourself, too, that I
have certain pieces of business depending, which were scarcely fit to
lay before a lawyer chosen at random. No more remains, but to ask if
you will undertake my service?”

“I have no great mind to it; but coming as you do with Alan’s button,
the choice is scarcely left me,” said he. “What are your instructions?”
he added, and took up his pen.

“The first point is to smuggle Alan forth of this country,” said I,
“but I need not be repeating that.”

“I am little likely to forget it,” said Stewart.

“The next thing is the bit money I am owing to Cluny,” I went on. “It
would be ill for me to find a conveyance, but that should be no stick
to you. It was two pounds five shillings and three-halfpence farthing
sterling.”

He noted it.

“Then,” said I, “there’s a Mr. Henderland, a licensed preacher and
missionary in Ardgour, that I would like well to get some snuff into
the hands of; and, as I daresay you keep touch with your friends in
Appin (so near by), it’s a job you could doubtless overtake with the
other.”

“How much snuff are we to say?” he asked.

“I was thinking of two pounds,” said I.

“Two,” said he.

“Then there’s the lass Alison Hastie, in Lime Kilns,” said I. “Her that
helped Alan and me across the Forth. I was thinking if I could get her
a good Sunday gown, such as she could wear with decency in her degree,
it would be an ease to my conscience; for the mere truth is, we owe her
our two lives.”

“I am glad so see you are thrifty, Mr. Balfour,” says he, making his
notes.

“I would think shame to be otherwise the first day of my fortune,” said
I. “And now, if you will compute the outlay and your own proper
charges, I would be glad to know if I could get some spending-money
back. It’s not that I grudge the whole of it to get Alan safe; it’s not
that I lack more; but having drawn so much the one day, I think it
would have a very ill appearance if I was back again seeking, the next.
Only be sure you have enough,” I added, “for I am very undesirous to
meet with you again.”

“Well, and I’m pleased to see you’re cautious, too,” said the Writer.
“But I think ye take a risk to lay so considerable a sum at my
discretion.”

He said this with a plain sneer.

“I’ll have to run the hazard,” I replied. “O, and there’s another
service I would ask, and that’s to direct me to a lodging, for I have
no roof to my head. But it must be a lodging I may seem to have hit
upon by accident, for it would never do if the Lord Advocate were to
get any jealousy of our acquaintance.”

“Ye may set your weary spirit at rest,” said he. “I will never name
your name, sir; and it’s my belief the Advocate is still so much to be
sympathised with that he doesnae ken of your existence.”

I saw I had got to the wrong side of the man.

“There’s a braw day coming for him, then,” said I, “for he’ll have to
learn of it on the deaf side of his head no later than to-morrow, when
I call on him.”

“When ye _call_ on him!” repeated Mr. Stewart. “Am I daft, or are you!
What takes ye near the Advocate!”

“O, just to give myself up,” said I.

“Mr. Balfour,” he cried, “are ye making a mock of me?”

“No, sir,” said I, “though I think you have allowed yourself some such
freedom with myself. But I give you to understand once and for all that
I am in no jesting spirit.”

“Nor yet me,” says Stewart. “And I give yon to understand (if that’s to
be the word) that I like the looks of your behaviour less and less. You
come here to me with all sorts of propositions, which will put me in a
train of very doubtful acts and bring me among very undesirable persons
this many a day to come. And then you tell me you’re going straight out
of my office to make your peace with the Advocate! Alan’s button here
or Alan’s button there, the four quarters of Alan wouldnae bribe me
further in.”

“I would take it with a little more temper,” said I, “and perhaps we
can avoid what you object to. I can see no way for it but to give
myself up, but perhaps you can see another; and if you could, I could
never deny but what I would be rather relieved. For I think my traffic
with his lordship is little likely to agree with my health. There’s
just the one thing clear, that I have to give my evidence; for I hope
it’ll save Alan’s character (what’s left of it), and James’s neck,
which is the more immediate.”

He was silent for a breathing-space, and then, “My man,” said he,
“you’ll never be allowed to give such evidence.”

“We’ll have to see about that,” said I; “I’m stiff-necked when I like.”

“Ye muckle ass!” cried Stewart, “it’s James they want; James has got to
hang—Alan, too, if they could catch him—but James whatever! Go near the
Advocate with any such business, and you’ll see! he’ll find a way to
muzzle, ye.”

“I think better of the Advocate than that,” said I.

“The Advocate be dammed!” cries he. “It’s the Campbells, man! You’ll
have the whole clanjamfry of them on your back; and so will the
Advocate too, poor body! It’s extraordinar ye cannot see where ye
stand! If there’s no fair way to stop your gab, there’s a foul one
gaping. They can put ye in the dock, do ye no see that?” he cried, and
stabbed me with one finger in the leg.

“Ay,” said I, “I was told that same no further back than this morning
by another lawyer.”

“And who was he?” asked Stewart, “He spoke sense at least.”

I told I must be excused from naming him, for he was a decent stout old
Whig, and had little mind to be mixed up in such affairs.

“I think all the world seems to be mixed up in it!” cries Stewart. “But
what said you?”

“I told him what had passed between Rankeillor and myself before the
house of Shaws.

“Well, and so ye will hang!” said he. “Ye’ll hang beside James Stewart.
There’s your fortune told.”

“I hope better of it yet than that,” said I; “but I could never deny
there was a risk.”

“Risk!” says he, and then sat silent again. “I ought to thank you for
your staunchness to my friends, to whom you show a very good spirit,”
he says, “if you have the strength to stand by it. But I warn you that
you’re wading deep. I wouldn’t put myself in your place (me that’s a
Stewart born!) for all the Stewarts that ever there were since Noah.
Risk? ay, I take over-many; but to be tried in court before a Campbell
jury and a Campbell judge, and that in a Campbell country and upon a
Campbell quarrel—think what you like of me, Balfour, it’s beyond me.”

“It’s a different way of thinking, I suppose,” said I; “I was brought
up to this one by my father before me.”

“Glory to his bones! he has left a decent son to his name,” says he.
“Yet I would not have you judge me over-sorely. My case is dooms hard.
See, sir, ye tell me ye’re a Whig: I wonder what I am. No Whig to be
sure; I couldnae be just that. But—laigh in your ear, man—I’m maybe no
very keen on the other side.”

“Is that a fact?” cried I. “It’s what I would think of a man of your
intelligence.”

“Hut! none of your whillywhas!” [4] cries he. “There’s intelligence
upon both sides. But for my private part I have no particular desire to
harm King George; and as for King James, God bless him! he does very
well for me across the water. I’m a lawyer, ye see: fond of my books
and my bottle, a good plea, a well-drawn deed, a crack in the
Parliament House with other lawyer bodies, and perhaps a turn at the
golf on a Saturday at e’en. Where do ye come in with your Hieland
plaids and claymores?”

“Well,” said I, “it’s a fact ye have little of the wild Highlandman.”

“Little?” quoth he. “Nothing, man! And yet I’m Hieland born, and when
the clan pipes, who but me has to dance! The clan and the name, that
goes by all. It’s just what you said yourself; my father learned it to
me, and a bonny trade I have of it. Treason and traitors, and the
smuggling of them out and in; and the French recruiting, weary fall it!
and the smuggling through of the recruits; and their pleas—a sorrow of
their pleas! Here have I been moving one for young Ardsheil, my cousin;
claimed the estate under the marriage contract—a forfeited estate! I
told them it was nonsense: muckle they cared! And there was I cocking
behind a yadvocate that liked the business as little as myself, for it
was fair ruin to the pair of us—a black mark, _disaffected_, branded on
our hurdies, like folk’s names upon their kye! And what can I do? I’m a
Stewart, ye see, and must fend for my clan and family. Then no later by
than yesterday there was one of our Stewart lads carried to the Castle.
What for? I ken fine: Act of 1736: recruiting for King Lewie. And
you’ll see, he’ll whistle me in to be his lawyer, and there’ll be
another black mark on my chara’ter! I tell you fair: if I but kent the
heid of a Hebrew word from the hurdies of it, be dammed but I would
fling the whole thing up and turn minister!”

“It’s rather a hard position,” said I.

“Dooms hard!” cries he. “And that’s what makes me think so much of
ye—you that’s no Stewart—to stick your head so deep in Stewart
business. And for what, I do not know: unless it was the sense of
duty.”

“I hope it will be that,” said I.

“Well,” says he, “it’s a grand quality. But here is my clerk back; and,
by your leave, we’ll pick a bit of dinner, all the three of us. When
that’s done, I’ll give you the direction of a very decent man, that’ll
be very fain to have you for a lodger. And I’ll fill your pockets to
ye, forbye, out of your ain bag. For this business’ll not be near as
dear as ye suppose—not even the ship part of it.”

I made him a sign that his clerk was within hearing.

“Hoot, ye neednae mind for Robbie,” cries he. “A Stewart, too, puir
deevil! and has smuggled out more French recruits and trafficking
Papists than what he has hairs upon his face. Why, it’s Robin that
manages that branch of my affairs. Who will we have now, Rob, for
across the water!”

“There’ll be Andie Scougal, in the _Thristle_,” replied Rob. “I saw
Hoseason the other day, but it seems he’s wanting the ship. Then
there’ll be Tam Stobo; but I’m none so sure of Tam. I’ve seen him
colloguing with some gey queer acquaintances; and if was anybody
important, I would give Tam the go-by.”

“The head’s worth two hundred pounds, Robin,” said Stewart.

“Gosh, that’ll no be Alan Breck!” cried the clerk.

“Just Alan,” said his master.

“Weary winds! that’s sayrious,” cried Robin. “I’ll try Andie, then;
Andie’ll be the best.”

“It seems it’s quite a big business,” I observed.

“Mr. Balfour, there’s no end to it,” said Stewart.

“There was a name your clerk mentioned,” I went on: “Hoseason. That
must be my man, I think: Hoseason, of the brig _Covenant_. Would you
set your trust on him?”

“He didnae behave very well to you and Alan,” said Mr. Stewart; “but my
mind of the man in general is rather otherwise. If he had taken Alan on
board his ship on an agreement, it’s my notion he would have proved a
just dealer. How say ye, Rob?”

“No more honest skipper in the trade than Eli,” said the clerk. “I
would lippen to [5] Eli’s word—ay, if it was the Chevalier, or Appin
himsel’,” he added.

“And it was him that brought the doctor, wasnae’t?” asked the master.

“He was the very man,” said the clerk.

“And I think he took the doctor back?” says Stewart.

“Ay, with his sporran full!” cried Robin. “And Eli kent of that!” [6]

“Well, it seems it’s hard to ken folk rightly,” said I.

“That was just what I forgot when ye came in, Mr. Balfour!” says the
Writer.




CHAPTER III.
I GO TO PILRIG


The next morning, I was no sooner awake in my new lodging than I was up
and into my new clothes; and no sooner the breakfast swallowed, than I
was forth on my adventurers. Alan, I could hope, was fended for; James
was like to be a more difficult affair, and I could not but think that
enterprise might cost me dear, even as everybody said to whom I had
opened my opinion. It seemed I was come to the top of the mountain only
to cast myself down; that I had clambered up, through so many and hard
trials, to be rich, to be recognised, to wear city clothes and a sword
to my side, all to commit mere suicide at the last end of it, and the
worst kind of suicide, besides, which is to get hanged at the King’s
charges.

What was I doing it for? I asked, as I went down the high Street and
out north by Leith Wynd. First I said it was to save James Stewart; and
no doubt the memory of his distress, and his wife’s cries, and a word
or so I had let drop on that occasion worked upon me strongly. At the
same time I reflected that it was (or ought to be) the most indifferent
matter to my father’s son, whether James died in his bed or from a
scaffold. He was Alan’s cousin, to be sure; but so far as regarded
Alan, the best thing would be to lie low, and let the King, and his
Grace of Argyll, and the corbie crows, pick the bones of his kinsman
their own way. Nor could I forget that, while we were all in the pot
together, James had shown no such particular anxiety whether for Alan
or me.

Next it came upon me I was acting for the sake of justice: and I
thought that a fine word, and reasoned it out that (since we dwelt in
polities, at some discomfort to each one of us) the main thing of all
must still be justice, and the death of any innocent man a wound upon
the whole community. Next, again, it was the Accuser of the Brethren
that gave me a turn of his argument; bade me think shame for pretending
myself concerned in these high matters, and told me I was but a prating
vain child, who had spoken big words to Rankeillor and to Stewart, and
held myself bound upon my vanity to make good that boastfulness. Nay,
and he hit me with the other end of the stick; for he accused me of a
kind of artful cowardice, going about at the expense of a little risk
to purchase greater safety. No doubt, until I had declared and cleared
myself, I might any day encounter Mungo Campbell or the sheriff’s
officer, and be recognised, and dragged into the Appin murder by the
heels; and, no doubt, in case I could manage my declaration with
success, I should breathe more free for ever after. But when I looked
this argument full in the face I could see nothing to be ashamed of. As
for the rest, “Here are the two roads,” I thought, “and both go to the
same place. It’s unjust that James should hang if I can save him; and
it would be ridiculous in me to have talked so much and then do
nothing. It’s lucky for James of the Glens that I have boasted
beforehand; and none so unlucky for myself, because now I’m committed
to do right. I have the name of a gentleman and the means of one; it
would be a poor duty that I was wanting in the essence.” And then I
thought this was a Pagan spirit, and said a prayer in to myself, asking
for what courage I might lack, and that I might go straight to my duty
like a soldier to battle, and come off again scatheless, as so many do.

This train of reasoning brought me to a more resolved complexion;
though it was far from closing up my sense of the dangers that
surrounded me, nor of how very apt I was (if I went on) to stumble on
the ladder of the gallows. It was a plain, fair morning, but the wind
in the east. The little chill of it sang in my blood, and gave me a
feeling of the autumn, and the dead leaves, and dead folks’ bodies in
their graves. It seemed the devil was in it, if I was to die in that
tide of my fortunes and for other folks’ affairs. On the top of the
Calton Hill, though it was not the customary time of year for that
diversion, some children were crying and running with their kites.
These toys appeared very plain against the sky; I remarked a great one
soar on the wind to a high altitude and then plump among the whins; and
I thought to myself at sight of it, “There goes Davie.”

My way lay over Mouter’s Hill, and through an end of a clachan on the
braeside among fields. There was a whirr of looms in it went from house
to house; bees bummed in the gardens; the neighbours that I saw at the
doorsteps talked in a strange tongue; and I found out later that this
was Picardy, a village where the French weavers wrought for the Linen
Company. Here I got a fresh direction for Pilrig, my destination; and a
little beyond, on the wayside, came by a gibbet and two men hanged in
chains. They were dipped in tar, as the manner is; the wind span them,
the chains clattered, and the birds hung about the uncanny
jumping-jacks and cried. The sight coming on me suddenly, like an
illustration of my fears, I could scarce be done with examining it and
drinking in discomfort. And, as I thus turned and turned about the
gibbet, what should I strike on, but a weird old wife, that sat behind
a leg of it, and nodded, and talked aloud to herself with becks and
courtesies.

“Who are these two, mother?” I asked, and pointed to the corpses.

“A blessing on your precious face!” she cried. “Twa joes [7] o’mine:
just two o’ my old joes, my hinny dear.”

“What did they suffer for?” I asked.

“Ou, just for the guid cause,” said she. “Aften I spaed to them the way
that it would end. Twa shillin’ Scots: no pickle mair; and there are
twa bonny callants hingin’ for ’t! They took it frae a wean [8]
belanged to Brouchton.”

“Ay!” said I to myself, and not to the daft limmer, “and did they come
to such a figure for so poor a business? This is to lose all indeed.”

“Gie’s your loof, [9] hinny,” says she, “and let me spae your weird to
ye.”

“No, mother,” said I, “I see far enough the way I am. It’s an unco
thing to see too far in front.”

“I read it in your bree,” she said. “There’s a bonnie lassie that has
bricht een, and there’s a wee man in a braw coat, and a big man in a
pouthered wig, and there’s the shadow of the wuddy, [10] joe, that lies
braid across your path. Gie’s your loof, hinny, and let Auld Merren
spae it to ye bonny.”

The two chance shots that seemed to point at Alan and the daughter of
James More struck me hard; and I fled from the eldritch creature,
casting her a baubee, which she continued to sit and play with under
the moving shadows of the hanged.

My way down the causeway of Leith Walk would have been more pleasant to
me but for this encounter. The old rampart ran among fields, the like
of them I had never seen for artfulness of agriculture; I was pleased,
besides, to be so far in the still countryside; but the shackles of the
gibbet clattered in my head; and the mope and mows of the old witch,
and the thought of the dead men, hag-rode my spirits. To hang on a
gallows, that seemed a hard case; and whether a man came to hang there
for two shillings Scots, or (as Mr. Stewart had it) from the sense of
duty, once he was tarred and shackled and hung up, the difference
seemed small. There might David Balfour hang, and other lads pass on
their errands and think light of him; and old daft limmers sit at a
leg-foot and spae their fortunes; and the clean genty maids go by, and
look to the other aide, and hold a nose. I saw them plain, and they had
grey eyes, and their screens upon their heads were of the Drummed
colours.

I was thus in the poorest of spirits, though still pretty resolved,
when I came in view of Pilrig, a pleasant gabled house set by the
walkside among some brave young woods. The laird’s horse was standing
saddled at the door as I came up, but himself was in the study, where
he received me in the midst of learned works and musical instruments,
for he was not only a deep philosopher but much of a musician. He
greeted me at first pretty well, and when he had read Rankeillor’s
letter, placed himself obligingly at my disposal.

“And what is it, cousin David!” said he—“since it appears that we are
cousins—what is this that I can do for you! A word to Prestongrange!
Doubtless that is easily given. But what should be the word?”

“Mr. Balfour,” said I, “if I were to tell you my whole story the way it
fell out, it’s my opinion (and it was Rankeillor’s before me) that you
would be very little made up with it.”

“I am sorry to hear this of you, kinsman,” says he.

“I must not take that at your hands, Mr. Balfour,” said I; “I have
nothing to my charge to make me sorry, or you for me, but just the
common infirmities of mankind. ‘The guilt of Adam’s first sin, the want
of original righteousness, and the corruption of my whole nature,’ so
much I must answer for, and I hope I have been taught where to look for
help,” I said; for I judged from the look of the man he would think the
better of me if I knew my questions. [11] “But in the way of worldly
honour I have no great stumble to reproach myself with; and my
difficulties have befallen me very much against my will and (by all
that I can see) without my fault. My trouble is to have become dipped
in a political complication, which it is judged you would be blythe to
avoid a knowledge of.”

“Why, very well, Mr. David,” he replied, “I am pleased to see you are
all that Rankeillor represented. And for what you say of political
complications, you do me no more than justice. It is my study to be
beyond suspicion, and indeed outside the field of it. The question is,”
says he, “how, if I am to know nothing of the matter, I can very well
assist you?”

“Why sir,” said I, “I propose you should write to his lordship, that I
am a young man of reasonable good family and of good means: both of
which I believe to be the case.”

“I have Rankeillor’s word for it,” said Mr. Balfour, “and I count that
a warran-dice against all deadly.”

“To which you might add (if you will take my word for so much) that I
am a good churchman, loyal to King George, and so brought up,” I went
on.

“None of which will do you any harm,” said Mr. Balfour.

“Then you might go on to say that I sought his lordship on a matter of
great moment, connected with His Majesty’s service and the
administration of justice,” I suggested.

“As I am not to hear the matter,” says the laird, “I will not take upon
myself to qualify its weight. ‘Great moment’ therefore falls, and
‘moment’ along with it. For the rest I might express myself much as you
propose.”

“And then, sir,” said I, and rubbed my neck a little with my thumb,
“then I would be very desirous if you could slip in a word that might
perhaps tell for my protection.”

“Protection?” says he, “for your protection! Here is a phrase that
somewhat dampens me. If the matter be so dangerous, I own I would be a
little loath to move in it blindfold.”

“I believe I could indicate in two words where the thing sticks,” said
I.

“Perhaps that would be the best,” said he.

“Well, it’s the Appin murder,” said I.

He held up both his hands. “Sirs! sirs!” cried he.

I thought by the expression of his face and voice that I had lost my
helper.

“Let me explain. . .” I began.

“I thank you kindly, I will hear no more of it,” says he. “I decline
_in toto_ to hear more of it. For your name’s sake and Rankeillor’s,
and perhaps a little for your own, I will do what I can to help you;
but I will hear no more upon the facts. And it is my first clear duty
to warn you. These are deep waters, Mr. David, and you are a young man.
Be cautious and think twice.”

“It is to be supposed I will have thought oftener than that, Mr.
Balfour,” said I, “and I will direct your attention again to
Rankeillor’s letter, where (I hope and believe) he has registered his
approval of that which I design.”

“Well, well,” said he; and then again, “Well, well! I will do what I
can for you.” There with he took a pen and paper, sat a while in
thought, and began to write with much consideration. “I understand that
Rankeillor approved of what you have in mind?” he asked presently.

“After some discussion, sir, he bade me to go forward in God’s name,”
said I.

“That is the name to go in,” said Mr. Balfour, and resumed his writing.
Presently, he signed, re-read what he had written, and addressed me
again. “Now here, Mr. David,” said he, “is a letter of introduction,
which I will seal without closing, and give into your hands open, as
the form requires. But, since I am acting in the dark, I will just read
it to you, so that you may see if it will secure your end—

“Pilrig, _August_ 26th, 1751.


“My Lord,—This is to bring to your notice my namesake and cousin, David
Balfour Esquire of Shaws, a young gentleman of unblemished descent and
good estate. He has enjoyed, besides, the more valuable advantages of a
godly training, and his political principles are all that your lordship
can desire. I am not in Mr. Balfour’s confidence, but I understand him
to have a matter to declare, touching His Majesty’s service and the
administration of justice; purposes for which your Lordship’s zeal is
known. I should add that the young gentleman’s intention is known to
and approved by some of his friends, who will watch with hopeful
anxiety the event of his success or failure.


“Whereupon,” continued Mr. Balfour, “I have subscribed myself with the
usual compliments. You observe I have said ‘some of your friends’; I
hope you can justify my plural?”

“Perfectly, sir; my purpose is known and approved by more than one,”
said I. “And your letter, which I take a pleasure to thank you for, is
all I could have hoped.”

“It was all I could squeeze out,” said he; “and from what I know of the
matter you design to meddle in, I can only pray God that it may prove
sufficient.”




CHAPTER IV.
LORD ADVOCATE PRESTONGRANGE


My kinsman kept me to a meal, “for the honour of the roof,” he said;
and I believe I made the better speed on my return. I had no thought
but to be done with the next stage, and have myself fully committed; to
a person circumstanced as I was, the appearance of closing a door on
hesitation and temptation was itself extremely tempting; and I was the
more disappointed, when I came to Prestongrange’s house, to be informed
he was abroad. I believe it was true at the moment, and for some hours
after; and then I have no doubt the Advocate came home again, and
enjoyed himself in a neighbouring chamber among friends, while perhaps
the very fact of my arrival was forgotten. I would have gone away a
dozen times, only for this strong drawing to have done with my
declaration out of hand and be able to lay me down to sleep with a free
conscience. At first I read, for the little cabinet where I was left
contained a variety of books. But I fear I read with little profit; and
the weather falling cloudy, the dusk coming up earlier than usual, and
my cabinet being lighted with but a loophole of a window, I was at last
obliged to desist from this diversion (such as it was), and pass the
rest of my time of waiting in a very burthensome vacuity. The sound of
people talking in a near chamber, the pleasant note of a harpsichord,
and once the voice of a lady singing, bore me a kind of company.

I do not know the hour, but the darkness was long come, when the door
of the cabinet opened, and I was aware, by the light behind him, of a
tall figure of a man upon the threshold. I rose at once.

“Is anybody there?” he asked. “Who in that?”

“I am bearer of a letter from the laird of Pilrig to the Lord
Advocate,” said I.

“Have you been here long?” he asked.

“I would not like to hazard an estimate of how many hours,” said I.

“It is the first I hear of it,” he replied, with a chuckle. “The lads
must have forgotten you. But you are in the bit at last, for I am
Prestongrange.”

So saying, he passed before me into the next room, whither (upon his
sign) I followed him, and where he lit a candle and took his place
before a business-table. It was a long room, of a good proportion,
wholly lined with books. That small spark of light in a corner struck
out the man’s handsome person and strong face. He was flushed, his eye
watered and sparkled, and before he sat down I observed him to sway
back and forth. No doubt, he had been supping liberally; but his mind
and tongue were under full control.

“Well, sir, sit ye down,” said he, “and let us see Pilrig’s letter.”

He glanced it through in the beginning carelessly, looking up and
bowing when he came to my name; but at the last words I thought I
observed his attention to redouble, and I made sure he read them twice.
All this while you are to suppose my heart was beating, for I had now
crossed my Rubicon and was come fairly on the field of battle.

“I am pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Balfour,” he said, when he
had done. “Let me offer you a glass of claret.”

“Under your favour, my lord, I think it would scarce be fair on me,”
said I. “I have come here, as the letter will have mentioned, on a
business of some gravity to myself; and, as I am little used with wine,
I might be the sooner affected.”

“You shall be the judge,” said he. “But if you will permit, I believe I
will even have the bottle in myself.”

He touched a bell, and a footman came, as at a signal, bringing wine
and glasses.

“You are sure you will not join me?” asked the Advocate. “Well, here is
to our better acquaintance! In what way can I serve you?”

“I should, perhaps, begin by telling you, my lord, that I am here at
your own pressing invitation,” said I.

“You have the advantage of me somewhere,” said he, “for I profess I
think I never heard of you before this evening.”

“Right, my lord; the name is, indeed, new to you,” said I. “And yet you
have been for some time extremely wishful to make my acquaintance, and
have declared the same in public.”

“I wish you would afford me a clue,” says he. “I am no Daniel.”

“It will perhaps serve for such,” said I, “that if I was in a jesting
humour—which is far from the case—I believe I might lay a claim on your
lordship for two hundred pounds.”

“In what sense?” he inquired.

“In the sense of rewards offered for my person,” said I.

He thrust away his glass once and for all, and sat straight up in the
chair where he had been previously lolling. “What am I to understand?”
said he.

“_A tall strong lad of about eighteen_,” I quoted, “_speaks like a
Lowlander and has no beard_.”

“I recognise those words,” said he, “which, if you have come here with
any ill-judged intention of amusing yourself, are like to prove
extremely prejudicial to your safety.”

“My purpose in this,” I replied, “is just entirely as serious as life
and death, and you have understood me perfectly. I am the boy who was
speaking with Glenure when he was shot.”

“I can only suppose (seeing you here) that you claim to be innocent,”
said he.

“The inference is clear,” I said. “I am a very loyal subject to King
George, but if I had anything to reproach myself with, I would have had
more discretion than to walk into your den.”

“I am glad of that,” said he. “This horrid crime, Mr. Balfour, is of a
dye which cannot permit any clemency. Blood has been barbarously shed.
It has been shed in direct opposition to his Majesty and our whole
frame of laws, by those who are their known and public oppugnants. I
take a very high sense of this. I will not deny that I consider the
crime as directly personal to his Majesty.”

“And unfortunately, my lord,” I added, a little drily, “directly
personal to another great personage who may be nameless.”

“If you mean anything by those words, I must tell you I consider them
unfit for a good subject; and were they spoke publicly I should make it
my business to take note of them,” said he. “You do not appear to me to
recognise the gravity of your situation, or you would be more careful
not to pejorate the same by words which glance upon the purity of
justice. Justice, in this country, and in my poor hands, is no
respecter of persons.”

“You give me too great a share in my own speech, my lord,” said I. “I
did but repeat the common talk of the country, which I have heard
everywhere, and from men of all opinions as I came along.”

“When you are come to more discretion you will understand such talk in
not to be listened to, how much less repeated,” says the Advocate. “But
I acquit you of an ill intention. That nobleman, whom we all honour,
and who has indeed been wounded in a near place by the late barbarity,
sits too high to be reached by these aspersions. The Duke of Argyle—you
see that I deal plainly with you—takes it to heart as I do, and as we
are both bound to do by our judicial functions and the service of his
Majesty; and I could wish that all hands, in this ill age, were equally
clean of family rancour. But from the accident that this is a Campbell
who has fallen martyr to his duty—as who else but the Campbells have
ever put themselves foremost on that path?—I may say it, who am no
Campbell—and that the chief of that great house happens (for all our
advantages) to be the present head of the College of Justice, small
minds and disaffected tongues are set agog in every changehouse in the
country; and I find a young gentleman like Mr. Balfour so ill-advised
as to make himself their echo.” So much he spoke with a very oratorical
delivery, as if in court, and then declined again upon the manner of a
gentleman. “All this apart,” said he. “It now remains that I should
learn what I am to do with you.”

“I had thought it was rather I that should learn the same from your
lordship,” said I.

“Ay, true,” says the Advocate. “But, you see, you come to me well
recommended. There is a good honest Whig name to this letter,” says he,
picking it up a moment from the table. “And—extra-judicially, Mr.
Balfour—there is always the possibility of some arrangement, I tell
you, and I tell you beforehand that you may be the more upon your
guard, your fate lies with me singly. In such a matter (be it said with
reverence) I am more powerful than the King’s Majesty; and should you
please me—and of course satisfy my conscience—in what remains to be
held of our interview, I tell you it may remain between ourselves.”

“Meaning how?” I asked.

“Why, I mean it thus, Mr. Balfour,” said he, “that if you give
satisfaction, no soul need know so much as that you visited my house;
and you may observe that I do not even call my clerk.”

I saw what way he was driving. “I suppose it is needless anyone should
be informed upon my visit,” said I, “though the precise nature of my
gains by that I cannot see. I am not at all ashamed of coming here.”

“And have no cause to be,” says he, encouragingly. “Nor yet (if you are
careful) to fear the consequences.”

“My lord,” said I, “speaking under your correction, I am not very easy
to be frightened.”

“And I am sure I do not seek to frighten you,” says he. “But to the
interrogation; and let me warn you to volunteer nothing beyond the
questions I shall ask you. It may consist very immediately with your
safety. I have a great discretion, it is true, but there are bounds to
it.”

“I shall try to follow your lordship’s advice,” said I.

He spread a sheet of paper on the table and wrote a heading. “It
appears you were present, by the way, in the wood of Lettermore at the
moment of the fatal shot,” he began. “Was this by accident?”

“By accident,” said I.

“How came you in speech with Colin Campbell?” he asked.

“I was inquiring my way of him to Aucharn,” I replied.

I observed he did not write this answer down.

“H’m, true,” said he, “I had forgotten that. And do you know, Mr.
Balfour, I would dwell, if I were you, as little as might be on your
relations with these Stewarts. It might be found to complicate our
business. I am not yet inclined to regard these matters as essential.”

“I had thought, my lord, that all points of fact were equally material
in such a case,” said I.

“You forget we are now trying these Stewarts,” he replied, with great
significance. “If we should ever come to be trying you, it will be very
different; and I shall press these very questions that I am now willing
to glide upon. But to resume: I have it here in Mr. Mungo Campbell’s
precognition that you ran immediately up the brae. How came that?”

“Not immediately, my lord, and the cause was my seeing of the
murderer.”

“You saw him, then?”

“As plain as I see your lordship, though not so near hand.”

“You know him?”

“I should know him again.”

“In your pursuit you were not so fortunate, then, as to overtake him?”

“I was not.”

“Was he alone?”

“He was alone.”

“There was no one else in that neighbourhood?”

“Alan Breck Stewart was not far off, in a piece of a wood.”

The Advocate laid his pen down. “I think we are playing at cross
purposes,” said he, “which you will find to prove a very ill amusement
for yourself.”

“I content myself with following your lordship’s advice, and answering
what I am asked,” said I.

“Be so wise as to bethink yourself in time,” said he, “I use you with
the most anxious tenderness, which you scarce seem to appreciate, and
which (unless you be more careful) may prove to be in vain.”

“I do appreciate your tenderness, but conceive it to be mistaken,” I
replied, with something of a falter, for I saw we were come to grips at
last. “I am here to lay before you certain information, by which I
shall convince you Alan had no hand whatever in the killing of
Glenure.”

The Advocate appeared for a moment at a stick, sitting with pursed
lips, and blinking his eyes upon me like an angry cat. “Mr. Balfour,”
he said at last, “I tell you pointedly you go an ill way for your own
interests.”

“My lord,” I said, “I am as free of the charge of considering my own
interests in this matter as your lordship. As God judges me, I have but
the one design, and that is to see justice executed and the innocent go
clear. If in pursuit of that I come to fall under your lordship’s
displeasure, I must bear it as I may.”

At this he rose from his chair, lit a second candle, and for a while
gazed upon me steadily. I was surprised to see a great change of
gravity fallen upon his face, and I could have almost thought he was a
little pale.

“You are either very simple, or extremely the reverse, and I see that I
must deal with you more confidentially,” says he. “This is a political
case—ah, yes, Mr. Balfour! whether we like it or no, the case is
political—and I tremble when I think what issues may depend from it. To
a political case, I need scarce tell a young man of your education, we
approach with very different thoughts from one which is criminal only.
_Salus populi suprema lex_ is a maxim susceptible of great abuse, but
it has that force which we find elsewhere only in the laws of nature: I
mean it has the force of necessity. I will open this out to you, if you
will allow me, at more length. You would have me believe—”

“Under your pardon, my lord, I would have you to believe nothing but
that which I can prove,” said I.

“Tut! tut; young gentleman,” says he, “be not so pragmatical, and
suffer a man who might be your father (if it was nothing more) to
employ his own imperfect language, and express his own poor thoughts,
even when they have the misfortune not to coincide with Mr. Balfour’s.
You would have me to believe Breck innocent. I would think this of
little account, the more so as we cannot catch our man. But the matter
of Breck’s innocence shoots beyond itself. Once admitted, it would
destroy the whole presumptions of our case against another and a very
different criminal; a man grown old in treason, already twice in arms
against his king and already twice forgiven; a fomentor of discontent,
and (whoever may have fired the shot) the unmistakable original of the
deed in question. I need not tell you that I mean James Stewart.”

“And I can just say plainly that the innocence of Alan and of James is
what I am here to declare in private to your lordship, and what I am
prepared to establish at the trial by my testimony,” said I.

“To which I can only answer by an equal plainness, Mr. Balfour,” said
he, “that (in that case) your testimony will not be called by me, and I
desire you to withhold it altogether.”

“You are at the head of Justice in this country,” I cried, “and you
propose to me a crime!”

“I am a man nursing with both hands the interests of this country,” he
replied, “and I press on you a political necessity. Patriotism is not
always moral in the formal sense. You might be glad of it, I think: it
is your own protection; the facts are heavy against you; and if I am
still trying to except you from a very dangerous place, it is in part
of course because I am not insensible to your honesty in coming here;
in part because of Pilrig’s letter; but in part, and in chief part,
because I regard in this matter my political duty first and my judicial
duty only second. For the same reason—I repeat it to you in the same
frank words—I do not want your testimony.”

“I desire not to be thought to make a repartee, when I express only the
plain sense of our position,” said I. “But if your lordship has no need
of my testimony, I believe the other side would be extremely blythe to
get it.”

Prestongrange arose and began to pace to and fro in the room. “You are
not so young,” he said, “but what you must remember very clearly the
year ’45 and the shock that went about the country. I read in Pilrig’s
letter that you are sound in Kirk and State. Who saved them in that
fatal year? I do not refer to His Royal Highness and his ramrods, which
were extremely useful in their day; but the country had been saved and
the field won before ever Cumberland came upon Drummossie. Who saved
it? I repeat; who saved the Protestant religion and the whole frame of
our civil institutions? The late Lord President Culloden, for one; he
played a man’s part, and small thanks he got for it—even as I, whom you
see before you, straining every nerve in the same service, look for no
reward beyond the conscience of my duties done. After the President,
who else? You know the answer as well as I do; ’tis partly a scandal,
and you glanced at it yourself, and I reproved you for it, when you
first came in. It was the Duke and the great clan of Campbell. Now here
is a Campbell foully murdered, and that in the King’s service. The Duke
and I are Highlanders. But we are Highlanders civilised, and it is not
so with the great mass of our clans and families. They have still
savage virtues and defects. They are still barbarians, like these
Stewarts; only the Campbells were barbarians on the right side, and the
Stewarts were barbarians on the wrong. Now be you the judge. The
Campbells expect vengeance. If they do not get it—if this man James
escape—there will be trouble with the Campbells. That means disturbance
in the Highlands, which are uneasy and very far from being disarmed:
the disarming is a farce. . .”

“I can bear you out in that,” said I.

“Disturbance in the Highlands makes the hour of our old watchful
enemy,” pursued his lordship, holding out a finger as he paced; “and I
give you my word we may have a ’45 again with the Campbells on the
other side. To protect the life of this man Stewart—which is forfeit
already on half-a-dozen different counts if not on this—do you propose
to plunge your country in war, to jeopardise the faith of your fathers,
and to expose the lives and fortunes of how many thousand innocent
persons? . . . These are considerations that weigh with me, and that I
hope will weigh no less with yourself, Mr. Balfour, as a lover of your
country, good government, and religious truth.”

“You deal with me very frankly, and I thank you for it,” said I. “I
will try on my side to be no less honest. I believe your policy to be
sound. I believe these deep duties may lie upon your lordship; I
believe you may have laid them on your conscience when you took the
oath of the high office which you hold. But for me, who am just a plain
man—or scarce a man yet—the plain duties must suffice. I can think but
of two things, of a poor soul in the immediate and unjust danger of a
shameful death, and of the cries and tears of his wife that still
tingle in my head. I cannot see beyond, my lord. It’s the way that I am
made. If the country has to fall, it has to fall. And I pray God, if
this be wilful blindness, that He may enlighten me before too late.”

He had heard me motionless, and stood so a while longer.

“This is an unexpected obstacle,” says he, aloud, but to himself.

“And how is your lordship to dispose of me?” I asked.

“If I wished,” said he, “you know that you might sleep in gaol?”

“My lord,” said I, “I have slept in worse places.”

“Well, my boy,” said he, “there is one thing appears very plainly from
our interview, that I may rely on your pledged word. Give me your
honour that you will be wholly secret, not only on what has passed
to-night, but in the matter of the Appin case, and I let you go free.”

“I will give it till to-morrow or any other near day that you may
please to set,” said I. “I would not be thought too wily; but if I gave
the promise without qualification your lordship would have attained his
end.”

“I had no thought to entrap you,” said he.

“I am sure of that,” said I.

“Let me see,” he continued. “To-morrow is the Sabbath. Come to me on
Monday by eight in the morning, and give me your promise until then.”

“Freely given, my lord,” said I. “And with regard to what has fallen
from yourself, I will give it for an long as it shall please God to
spare your days.”

“You will observe,” he said next, “that I have made no employment of
menaces.”

“It was like your lordship’s nobility,” said I. “Yet I am not
altogether so dull but what I can perceive the nature of those you have
not uttered.”

“Well,” said he, “good-night to you. May you sleep well, for I think it
is more than I am like to do.”

With that he sighed, took up a candle, and gave me his conveyance as
far as the street door.




CHAPTER V.
IN THE ADVOCATE’S HOUSE


The next day, Sabbath, August 27th, I had the occasion I had long
looked forward to, to hear some of the famous Edinburgh preachers, all
well known to me already by the report of Mr Campbell. Alas! and I
might just as well have been at Essendean, and sitting under Mr.
Campbell’s worthy self! the turmoil of my thoughts, which dwelt
continually on the interview with Prestongrange, inhibiting me from all
attention. I was indeed much less impressed by the reasoning of the
divines than by the spectacle of the thronged congregation in the
churches, like what I imagined of a theatre or (in my then disposition)
of an assize of trial; above all at the West Kirk, with its three tiers
of galleries, where I went in the vain hope that I might see Miss
Drummond.

On the Monday I betook me for the first time to a barber’s, and was
very well pleased with the result. Thence to the Advocate’s, where the
red coats of the soldiers showed again about his door, making a bright
place in the close. I looked about for the young lady and her gillies:
there was never a sign of them. But I was no sooner shown into the
cabinet or antechamber where I had spent so wearyful a time upon the
Saturday, than I was aware of the tall figure of James More in a
corner. He seemed a prey to a painful uneasiness, reaching forth his
feet and hands, and his eyes speeding here and there without rest about
the walls of the small chamber, which recalled to me with a sense of
pity the man’s wretched situation. I suppose it was partly this, and
partly my strong continuing interest in his daughter, that moved me to
accost him.

“Give you a good-morning, sir,” said I.

“And a good-morning to you, sir,” said he.

“You bide tryst with Prestongrange?” I asked.

“I do, sir, and I pray your business with that gentleman be more
agreeable than mine,” was his reply.

“I hope at least that yours will be brief, for I suppose you pass
before me,” said I.

“All pass before me,” he said, with a shrug and a gesture upward of the
open hands. “It was not always so, sir, but times change. It was not so
when the sword was in the scale, young gentleman, and the virtues of
the soldier might sustain themselves.”

There came a kind of Highland snuffle out of the man that raised my
dander strangely.

“Well, Mr. Macgregor,” said I, “I understand the main thing for a
soldier is to be silent, and the first of his virtues never to
complain.”

“You have my name, I perceive”—he bowed to me with his arms
crossed—“though it’s one I must not use myself. Well, there is a
publicity—I have shown my face and told my name too often in the beards
of my enemies. I must not wonder if both should be known to many that I
know not.”

“That you know not in the least, sir,” said I, “nor yet anybody else;
but the name I am called, if you care to hear it, is Balfour.”

“It is a good name,” he replied, civilly; “there are many decent folk
that use it. And now that I call to mind, there was a young gentleman,
your namesake, that marched surgeon in the year ’45 with my battalion.”

“I believe that would be a brother to Balfour of Baith,” said I, for I
was ready for the surgeon now.

“The same, sir,” said James More. “And since I have been fellow-soldier
with your kinsman, you must suffer me to grasp your hand.”

He shook hands with me long and tenderly, beaming on me the while as
though he had found a brother.

“Ah!” says he, “these are changed days since your cousin and I heard
the balls whistle in our lugs.”

“I think he was a very far-away cousin,” said I, drily, “and I ought to
tell you that I never clapped eyes upon the man.”

“Well, well,” said he, “it makes no change. And you—I do not think you
were out yourself, sir—I have no clear mind of your face, which is one
not probable to be forgotten.”

“In the year you refer to, Mr. Macgregor, I was getting skelped in the
parish school,” said I.

“So young!” cries he. “Ah, then, you will never be able to think what
this meeting is to me. In the hour of my adversity, and here in the
house of my enemy, to meet in with the blood of an old
brother-in-arms—it heartens me, Mr. Balfour, like the skirling of the
highland pipes! Sir, this is a sad look back that many of us have to
make: some with falling tears. I have lived in my own country like a
king; my sword, my mountains, and the faith of my friends and kinsmen
sufficed for me. Now I lie in a stinking dungeon; and do you know, Mr.
Balfour,” he went on, taking my arm and beginning to lead me about, “do
you know, sir, that I lack mere ne_cess_aries? The malice of my foes
has quite sequestered my resources. I lie, as you know, sir, on a
trumped-up charge, of which I am as innocent as yourself. They dare not
bring me to my trial, and in the meanwhile I am held naked in my
prison. I could have wished it was your cousin I had met, or his
brother Baith himself. Either would, I know, have been rejoiced to help
me; while a comparative stranger like yourself—”

I would be ashamed to set down all he poured out to me in this beggarly
vein, or the very short and grudging answers that I made to him. There
were times when I was tempted to stop his mouth with some small change;
but whether it was from shame or pride—whether it was for my own sake
or Catriona’s—whether it was because I thought him no fit father for
his daughter, or because I resented that grossness of immediate falsity
that clung about the man himself—the thing was clean beyond me. And I
was still being wheedled and preached to, and still being marched to
and fro, three steps and a turn, in that small chamber, and had
already, by some very short replies, highly incensed, although not
finally discouraged, my beggar, when Prestongrange appeared in the
doorway and bade me eagerly into his big chamber.

“I have a moment’s engagements,” said he; “and that you may not sit
empty-handed I am going to present you to my three braw daughters, of
whom perhaps you may have heard, for I think they are more famous than
papa. This way.”

He led me into another long room above, where a dry old lady sat at a
frame of embroidery, and the three handsomest young women (I suppose)
in Scotland stood together by a window.

“This is my new friend, Mr Balfour,” said he, presenting me by the arm,
“David, here is my sister, Miss Grant, who is so good as keep my house
for me, and will be very pleased if she can help you. And here,” says
he, turning to the three younger ladies, “here are my _three braw
dauchters_. A fair question to ye, Mr. Davie: which of the three is the
best favoured? And I wager he will never have the impudence to propound
honest Alan Ramsay’s answer!”

Hereupon all three, and the old Miss Grant as well, cried out against
this sally, which (as I was acquainted with the verses he referred to)
brought shame into my own check. It seemed to me a citation
unpardonable in a father, and I was amazed that these ladies could
laugh even while they reproved, or made believe to.

Under cover of this mirth, Prestongrange got forth of the chamber, and
I was left, like a fish upon dry land, in that very unsuitable society.
I could never deny, in looking back upon what followed, that I was
eminently stockish; and I must say the ladies were well drilled to have
so long a patience with me. The aunt indeed sat close at her
embroidery, only looking now and again and smiling; but the misses, and
especially the eldest, who was besides the most handsome, paid me a
score of attentions which I was very ill able to repay. It was all in
vain to tell myself I was a young follow of some worth as well as a
good estate, and had no call to feel abashed before these lasses, the
eldest not so much older than myself, and no one of them by any
probability half as learned. Reasoning would not change the fact; and
there were times when the colour came into my face to think I was
shaved that day for the first time.

The talk going, with all their endeavours, very heavily, the eldest
took pity on my awkwardness, sat down to her instrument, of which she
was a passed mistress, and entertained me for a while with playing and
singing, both in the Scots and in the Italian manners; this put me more
at my ease, and being reminded of Alan’s air that he had taught me in
the hole near Carriden, I made so bold as to whistle a bar or two, and
ask if she knew that.

She shook her head. “I never heard a note of it,” said she. “Whistle it
all through. And now once again,” she added, after I had done so.

Then she picked it out upon the keyboard, and (to my surprise)
instantly enriched the same with well-sounding chords, and sang, as she
played, with a very droll expression and broad accent—

“Haenae I got just the lilt of it?
Isnae this the tune that ye whustled?”


“You see,” she says, “I can do the poetry too, only it won’t rhyme. And
then again:

“I am Miss Grant, sib to the Advocate:
You, I believe, are Dauvit Balfour.”


I told her how much astonished I was by her genius.

“And what do you call the name of it?” she asked.

“I do not know the real name,” said I. “I just call it _Alan’s air_.”

She looked at me directly in the face. “I shall call it _David’s air_,”
said she; “though if it’s the least like what your namesake of Israel
played to Saul I would never wonder that the king got little good by
it, for it’s but melancholy music. Your other name I do not like; so if
you was ever wishing to hear your tune again you are to ask for it by
mine.”

This was said with a significance that gave my heart a jog. “Why that,
Miss Grant?” I asked.

“Why,” says she, “if ever you should come to get hanged, I will set
your last dying speech and confession to that tune and sing it.”

This put it beyond a doubt that she was partly informed of my story and
peril. How, or just how much, it was more difficult to guess. It was
plain she knew there was something of danger in the name of Alan, and
thus warned me to leave it out of reference; and plain she knew that I
stood under some criminal suspicion. I judged besides that the
harshness of her last speech (which besides she had followed up
immediately with a very noisy piece of music) was to put an end to the
present conversation. I stood beside her, affecting to listen and
admire, but truly whirled away by my own thoughts. I have always found
this young lady to be a lover of the mysterious; and certainly this
first interview made a mystery that was beyond my plummet. One thing I
learned long after, the hours of the Sunday had been well employed, the
bank porter had been found and examined, my visit to Charles Stewart
was discovered, and the deduction made that I was pretty deep with
James and Alan, and most likely in a continued correspondence with the
last. Hence this broad hint that was given me across the harpsichord.

In the midst of the piece of music, one of the younger misses, who was
at a window over the close, cried on her sisters to come quick, for
there was “_Grey eyes_ again.” The whole family trooped there at once,
and crowded one another for a look. The window whither they ran was in
an odd corner of that room, gave above the entrance door, and flanked
up the close.

“Come, Mr. Balfour,” they cried, “come and see. She is the most
beautiful creature! She hangs round the close-head these last days,
always with some wretched-like gillies, and yet seems quite a lady.”

I had no need to look; neither did I look twice, or long. I was afraid
she might have seen me there, looking down upon her from that chamber
of music, and she without, and her father in the same house, perhaps
begging for his life with tears, and myself come but newly from
rejecting his petitions. But even that glance set me in a better
conceit of myself and much less awe of the young ladies. They were
beautiful, that was beyond question, but Catriona was beautiful too,
and had a kind of brightness in her like a coal of fire. As much as the
others cast me down, she lifted me up. I remembered I had talked easily
with her. If I could make no hand of it with these fine maids, it was
perhaps something their own fault. My embarrassment began to be a
little mingled and lightened with a sense of fun; and when the aunt
smiled at me from her embroidery, and the three daughters unbent to me
like a baby, all with “papa’s orders” written on their faces, there
were times when I could have found it in my heart to smile myself.

Presently papa returned, the same kind, happy-like, pleasant-spoken
man.

“Now, girls,” said he, “I must take Mr. Balfour away again; but I hope
you have been able to persuade him to return where I shall be always
gratified to find him.”

So they each made me a little farthing compliment, and I was led away.

If this visit to the family had been meant to soften my resistance, it
was the worst of failures. I was no such ass but what I understood how
poor a figure I had made, and that the girls would be yawning their
jaws off as soon as my stiff back was turned. I felt I had shown how
little I had in me of what was soft and graceful; and I longed for a
chance to prove that I had something of the other stuff, the stern and
dangerous.

Well, I was to be served to my desire, for the scene to which he was
conducting me was of a different character.




CHAPTER VI.
UMQUILE THE MASTER OF LOVAT


There was a man waiting us in Prestongrange’s study, whom I distasted
at the first look, as we distaste a ferret or an earwig. He was bitter
ugly, but seemed very much of a gentleman; had still manners, but
capable of sudden leaps and violences; and a small voice, which could
ring out shrill and dangerous when he so desired.

The Advocate presented us in a familiar, friendly way.

“Here, Fraser,” said he, “here is Mr. Balfour whom we talked about. Mr.
David, this is Mr. Simon Fraser, whom we used to call by another title,
but that is an old song. Mr. Fraser has an errand to you.”

With that he stepped aside to his book-shelves, and made believe to
consult a quarto volume in the far end.

I was thus left (in a sense) alone with perhaps the last person in the
world I had expected. There was no doubt upon the terms of
introduction; this could be no other than the forfeited Master of Lovat
and chief of the great clan Fraser. I knew he had led his men in the
Rebellion; I knew his father’s head—my old lord’s, that grey fox of the
mountains—to have fallen on the block for that offence, the lands of
the family to have been seized, and their nobility attainted. I could
not conceive what he should be doing in Grant’s house; I could not
conceive that he had been called to the bar, had eaten all his
principles, and was now currying favour with the Government even to the
extent of acting Advocate-Depute in the Appin murder.

“Well, Mr. Balfour,” said he, “what is all this I hear of ye?”

“It would not become me to prejudge,” said I, “but if the Advocate was
your authority he is fully possessed of my opinions.”

“I may tell you I am engaged in the Appin case,” he went on; “I am to
appear under Prestongrange; and from my study of the precognitions I
can assure you your opinions are erroneous. The guilt of Breck is
manifest; and your testimony, in which you admit you saw him on the
hill at the very moment, will certify his hanging.”

“It will be rather ill to hang him till you catch him,” I observed.
“And for other matters I very willingly leave you to your own
impressions.”

“The Duke has been informed,” he went on. “I have just come from his
Grace, and he expressed himself before me with an honest freedom like
the great nobleman he is. He spoke of you by name, Mr. Balfour, and
declared his gratitude beforehand in case you would be led by those who
understand your own interests and those of the country so much better
than yourself. Gratitude is no empty expression in that mouth:
_experto-crede_. I daresay you know something of my name and clan, and
the damnable example and lamented end of my late father, to say nothing
of my own errata. Well, I have made my peace with that good Duke; he
has intervened for me with our friend Prestongrange; and here I am with
my foot in the stirrup again and some of the responsibility shared into
my hand of prosecuting King George’s enemies and avenging the late
daring and barefaced insult to his Majesty.”

“Doubtless a proud position for your father’s son,” says I.

He wagged his bald eyebrows at me. “You are pleased to make experiments
in the ironical, I think,” said he. “But I am here upon duty, I am here
to discharge my errand in good faith, it is in vain you think to divert
me. And let me tell you, for a young fellow of spirit and ambition like
yourself, a good shove in the beginning will do more than ten years’
drudgery. The shove is now at your command; choose what you will to be
advanced in, the Duke will watch upon you with the affectionate
disposition of a father.”

“I am thinking that I lack the docility of the son,” says I.

“And do you really suppose, sir, that the whole policy of this country
is to be suffered to trip up and tumble down for an ill-mannered colt
of a boy?” he cried. “This has been made a test case, all who would
prosper in the future must put a shoulder to the wheel. Look at me! Do
you suppose it is for my pleasure that I put myself in the highly
invidious position of persecuting a man that I have drawn the sword
alongside of? The choice is not left me.”

“But I think, sir, that you forfeited your choice when you mixed in
with that unnatural rebellion,” I remarked. “My case is happily
otherwise; I am a true man, and can look either the Duke or King George
in the face without concern.”

“Is it so the wind sits?” says he. “I protest you are fallen in the
worst sort of error. Prestongrange has been hitherto so civil (he tells
me) as not to combat your allegations; but you must not think they are
not looked upon with strong suspicion. You say you are innocent. My
dear sir, the facts declare you guilty.”

“I was waiting for you there,” said I.

“The evidence of Mungo Campbell; your flight after the completion of
the murder; your long course of secresy—my good young man!” said Mr.
Simon, “here is enough evidence to hang a bullock, let be a David
Balfour! I shall be upon that trial; my voice shall be raised; I shall
then speak much otherwise from what I do to-day, and far less to your
gratification, little as you like it now! Ah, you look white!” cries
he. “I have found the key of your impudent heart. You look pale, your
eyes waver, Mr. David! You see the grave and the gallows nearer by than
you had fancied.”

“I own to a natural weakness,” said I. “I think no shame for that.
Shame. . .” I was going on.

“Shame waits for you on the gibbet,” he broke in.

“Where I shall but be even’d with my lord your father,” said I.

“Aha, but not so!” he cried, “and you do not yet see to the bottom of
this business. My father suffered in a great cause, and for dealing in
the affairs of kings. You are to hang for a dirty murder about
boddle-pieces. Your personal part in it, the treacherous one of holding
the poor wretch in talk, your accomplices a pack of ragged Highland
gillies. And it can be shown, my great Mr. Balfour—it can be shown, and
it _will_ be shown, trust _me_ that has a finger in the pie—it can be
shown, and shall be shown, that you were paid to do it. I think I can
see the looks go round the court when I adduce my evidence, and it
shall appear that you, a young man of education, let yourself be
corrupted to this shocking act for a suit of cast clothes, a bottle of
Highland spirits, and three-and-fivepence-halfpenny in copper money.”

There was a touch of the truth in these words that knocked me like a
blow: clothes, a bottle of _usquebaugh_, and
three-and-fivepence-halfpenny in change made up, indeed, the most of
what Alan and I had carried from Auchurn; and I saw that some of
James’s people had been blabbing in their dungeons.

“You see I know more than you fancied,” he resumed in triumph. “And as
for giving it this turn, great Mr. David, you must not suppose the
Government of Great Britain and Ireland will ever be stuck for want of
evidence. We have men here in prison who will swear out their lives as
we direct them; as I direct, if you prefer the phrase. So now you are
to guess your part of glory if you choose to die. On the one hand,
life, wine, women, and a duke to be your handgun: on the other, a rope
to your craig, and a gibbet to clatter your bones on, and the lousiest,
lowest story to hand down to your namesakes in the future that was ever
told about a hired assassin. And see here!” he cried, with a formidable
shrill voice, “see this paper that I pull out of my pocket. Look at the
name there: it is the name of the great David, I believe, the ink
scarce dry yet. Can you guess its nature? It is the warrant for your
arrest, which I have but to touch this bell beside me to have executed
on the spot. Once in the Tolbooth upon this paper, may God help you,
for the die is cast!”

I must never deny that I was greatly horrified by so much baseness, and
much unmanned by the immediacy and ugliness of my danger. Mr. Simon had
already gloried in the changes of my hue; I make no doubt I was now no
ruddier than my shirt; my speech besides trembled.

“There is a gentleman in this room,” cried I. “I appeal to him. I put
my life and credit in his hands.”

Prestongrange shut his book with a snap. “I told you so, Simon,” said
he; “you have played your hand for all it was worth, and you have lost.
Mr. David,” he went on, “I wish you to believe it was by no choice of
mine you were subjected to this proof. I wish you could understand how
glad I am you should come forth from it with so much credit. You may
not quite see how, but it is a little of a service to myself. For had
our friend here been more successful than I was last night, it might
have appeared that he was a better judge of men than I; it might have
appeared we were altogether in the wrong situations, Mr. Simon and
myself. And I know our friend Simon to be ambitious,” says he, striking
lightly on Fraser’s shoulder. “As for this stage play, it is over; my
sentiments are very much engaged in your behalf; and whatever issue we
can find to this unfortunate affair, I shall make it my business to see
it is adopted with tenderness to you.”

These were very good words, and I could see besides that there was
little love, and perhaps a spice of genuine ill-will, between these two
who were opposed to me. For all that, it was unmistakable this
interview had been designed, perhaps rehearsed, with the consent of
both; it was plain my adversaries were in earnest to try me by all
methods; and now (persuasion, flattery, and menaces having been tried
in vain) I could not but wonder what would be their next expedient. My
eyes besides were still troubled, and my knees loose under me, with the
distress of the late ordeal; and I could do no more than stammer the
same form of words: “I put my life and credit in your hands.”

“Well, well,” said he, “we must try to save them. And in the meanwhile
let us return to gentler methods. You must not bear any grudge upon my
friend, Mr. Simon, who did but speak by his brief. And even if you did
conceive some malice against myself, who stood by and seemed rather to
hold a candle, I must not let that extend to innocent members of my
family. These are greatly engaged to see more of you, and I cannot
consent to have my young womenfolk disappointed. To-morrow they will be
going to Hope Park, where I think it very proper you should make your
bow. Call for me first, when I may possibly have something for your
private hearing; then you shall be turned abroad again under the
conduct of my misses; and until that time repeat to me your promise of
secrecy.”

I had done better to have instantly refused, but in truth I was beside
the power of reasoning; did as I was bid; took my leave I know not how;
and when I was forth again in the close, and the door had shut behind
me, was glad to lean on a house wall and wipe my face. That horrid
apparition (as I may call it) of Mr. Simon rang in my memory, as a
sudden noise rings after it is over in the ear. Tales of the man’s
father, of his falseness, of his manifold perpetual treacheries, rose
before me from all that I had heard and read, and joined on with what I
had just experienced of himself. Each time it occurred to me, the
ingenious foulness of that calumny he had proposed to nail upon my
character startled me afresh. The case of the man upon the gibbet by
Leith Walk appeared scarce distinguishable from that I was now to
consider as my own. To rob a child of so little more than nothing was
certainly a paltry enterprise for two grown men; but my own tale, as it
was to be represented in a court by Simon Fraser, appeared a fair
second in every possible point of view of sordidness and cowardice.

The voices of two of Prestongrange’s liveried men upon his doorstep
recalled me to myself.

“Ha’e,” said the one, “this billet as fast as ye can link to the
captain.”

“Is that for the cateran back again?” asked the other.

“It would seem sae,” returned the first. “Him and Simon are seeking
him.”

“I think Prestongrange is gane gyte,” says the second. “He’ll have
James More in bed with him next.”

“Weel, it’s neither your affair nor mine’s,” said the first.

And they parted, the one upon his errand, and the other back into the
house.

This looked as ill as possible. I was scarce gone and they were sending
already for James More, to whom I thought Mr. Simon must have pointed
when he spoke of men in prison and ready to redeem their lives by all
extremities. My scalp curdled among my hair, and the next moment the
blood leaped in me to remember Catriona. Poor lass! her father stood to
be hanged for pretty indefensible misconduct. What was yet more
unpalatable, it now seemed he was prepared to save his four quarters by
the worst of shame and the most foul of cowardly murders—murder by the
false oath; and to complete our misfortunes, it seemed myself was
picked out to be the victim.

I began to walk swiftly and at random, conscious only of a desire for
movement, air, and the open country.




CHAPTER VII.
I MAKE A FAULT IN HONOUR


I came forth, I vow I know not how, on the _Lang Dykes_ [12]. This is a
rural road which runs on the north side over against the city. Thence I
could see the whole black length of it tail down, from where the castle
stands upon its crags above the loch in a long line of spires and gable
ends, and smoking chimneys, and at the sight my heart swelled in my
bosom. My youth, as I have told, was already inured to dangers; but
such danger as I had seen the face of but that morning, in the midst of
what they call the safety of a town, shook me beyond experience. Peril
of slavery, peril of shipwreck, peril of sword and shot, I had stood
all of these without discredit; but the peril there was in the sharp
voice and the fat face of Simon, properly Lord Lovat, daunted me
wholly.

I sat by the lake side in a place where the rushes went down into the
water, and there steeped my wrists and laved my temples. If I could
have done so with any remains of self-esteem, I would now have fled
from my foolhardy enterprise. But (call it courage or cowardice, and I
believe it was both the one and the other) I decided I was ventured out
beyond the possibility of a retreat. I had out-faced these men, I would
continue to out-face them; come what might, I would stand by the word
spoken.

The sense of my own constancy somewhat uplifted my spirits, but not
much. At the best of it there was an icy place about my heart, and life
seemed a black business to be at all engaged in. For two souls in
particular my pity flowed. The one was myself, to be so friendless and
lost among dangers. The other was the girl, the daughter of James More.
I had seen but little of her; yet my view was taken and my judgment
made. I thought her a lass of a clean honour, like a man’s; I thought
her one to die of a disgrace; and now I believed her father to be at
that moment bargaining his vile life for mine. It made a bond in my
thoughts betwixt the girl and me. I had seen her before only as a
wayside appearance, though one that pleased me strangely; I saw her now
in a sudden nearness of relation, as the daughter of my blood foe, and
I might say, my murderer. I reflected it was hard I should be so
plagued and persecuted all my days for other folks’ affairs, and have
no manner of pleasure myself. I got meals and a bed to sleep in when my
concerns would suffer it; beyond that my wealth was of no help to me.
If I was to hang, my days were like to be short; if I was not to hang
but to escape out of this trouble, they might yet seem long to me ere I
was done with them. Of a sudden her face appeared in my memory, the way
I had first seen it, with the parted lips; at that, weakness came in my
bosom and strength into my legs; and I set resolutely forward on the
way to Dean. If I was to hang to-morrow, and it was sure enough I might
very likely sleep that night in a dungeon, I determined I should hear
and speak once more with Catriona.

The exercise of walking and the thought of my destination braced me yet
more, so that I began to pluck up a kind of spirit. In the village of
Dean, where it sits in the bottom of a glen beside the river, I
inquired my way of a miller’s man, who sent me up the hill upon the
farther side by a plain path, and so to a decent-like small house in a
garden of lawns and apple-trees. My heart beat high as I stepped inside
the garden hedge, but it fell low indeed when I came face to face with
a grim and fierce old lady, walking there in a white mutch with a man’s
hat strapped upon the top of it.

“What do ye come seeking here?” she asked.

I told her I was after Miss Drummond.

“And what may be your business with Miss Drummond?” says she.

I told her I had met her on Saturday last, had been so fortunate as to
render her a trifling service, and was come now on the young lady’s
invitation.

“O, so you’re Saxpence!” she cried, with a very sneering manner. “A
braw gift, a bonny gentleman. And hae ye ony ither name and
designation, or were ye bapteesed Saxpence?” she asked.

I told my name.

“Preserve me!” she cried. “Has Ebenezer gotten a son?”

“No, ma’am,” said I. “I am a son of Alexander’s. It’s I that am the
Laird of Shaws.”

“Ye’ll find your work cut out for ye to establish that,” quoth she.

“I perceive you know my uncle,” said I; “and I daresay you may be the
better pleased to hear that business is arranged.”

“And what brings ye here after Miss Drummond?” she pursued.

“I’m come after my saxpence, mem,” said I. “It’s to be thought, being
my uncle’s nephew, I would be found a careful lad.”

“So ye have a spark of sleeness in ye?” observed the old lady, with
some approval. “I thought ye had just been a cuif—you and your
saxpence, and your _lucky day_ and your _sake of Balwhidder_”—from
which I was gratified to learn that Catriona had not forgotten some of
our talk. “But all this is by the purpose,” she resumed. “Am I to
understand that ye come here keeping company?”

“This is surely rather an early question,” said I. “The maid is young,
so am I, worse fortune. I have but seen her the once. I’ll not deny,” I
added, making up my mind to try her with some frankness, “I’ll not deny
but she has run in my head a good deal since I met in with her. That is
one thing; but it would be quite another, and I think I would look very
like a fool, to commit myself.”

“You can speak out of your mouth, I see,” said the old lady. “Praise
God, and so can I! I was fool enough to take charge of this rogue’s
daughter: a fine charge I have gotten; but it’s mine, and I’ll carry it
the way I want to. Do ye mean to tell me, Mr. Balfour of Shaws, that
you would marry James More’s daughter, and him hanged! Well, then,
where there’s no possible marriage there shall be no manner of
carryings on, and take that for said. Lasses are bruckle things,” she
added, with a nod; “and though ye would never think it by my wrunkled
chafts, I was a lassie mysel’, and a bonny one.”

“Lady Allardyce,” said I, “for that I suppose to be your name, you seem
to do the two sides of the talking, which is a very poor manner to come
to an agreement. You give me rather a home thrust when you ask if I
would marry, at the gallow’s foot, a young lady whom I have seen but
once. I have told you already I would never be so untenty as to commit
myself. And yet I’ll go some way with you. If I continue to like the
lass as well as I have reason to expect, it will be something more than
her father, or the gallows either, that keeps the two of us apart. As
for my family, I found it by the wayside like a lost bawbee! I owe less
than nothing to my uncle and if ever I marry, it will be to please one
person: that’s myself.”

“I have heard this kind of talk before ye were born,” said Mrs. Ogilvy,
“which is perhaps the reason that I think of it so little. There’s much
to be considered. This James More is a kinsman of mine, to my shame be
it spoken. But the better the family, the mair men hanged or headed,
that’s always been poor Scotland’s story. And if it was just the
hanging! For my part I think I would be best pleased with James upon
the gallows, which would be at least an end to him. Catrine’s a good
lass enough, and a good-hearted, and lets herself be deaved all day
with a runt of an auld wife like me. But, ye see, there’s the weak bit.
She’s daft about that long, false, fleeching beggar of a father of
hers, and red-mad about the Gregara, and proscribed names, and King
James, and a wheen blethers. And you might think ye could guide her, ye
would find yourself sore mista’en. Ye say ye’ve seen her but the once.
. .”

“Spoke with her but the once, I should have said,” I interrupted. “I
saw her again this morning from a window at Prestongrange’s.”

This I daresay I put in because it sounded well; but I was properly
paid for my ostentation on the return.

“What’s this of it?” cries the old lady, with a sudden pucker of her
face. “I think it was at the Advocate’s door-cheek that ye met her
first.”

I told her that was so.

“H’m,” she said; and then suddenly, upon rather a scolding tone, “I
have your bare word for it,” she cries, “as to who and what you are. By
your way of it, you’re Balfour of the Shaws; but for what I ken you may
be Balfour of the Deevil’s oxter. It’s possible ye may come here for
what ye say, and it’s equally possible ye may come here for deil care
what! I’m good enough Whig to sit quiet, and to have keepit all my
men-folk’s heads upon their shoulders. But I’m not just a good enough
Whig to be made a fool of neither. And I tell you fairly, there’s too
much Advocate’s door and Advocate’s window here for a man that comes
taigling after a Macgregor’s daughter. Ye can tell that to the Advocate
that sent ye, with my fond love. And I kiss my loof to ye, Mr.
Balfour,” says she, suiting the action to the word; “and a braw journey
to ye back to where ye cam frae.”

“If you think me a spy,” I broke out, and speech stuck in my throat. I
stood and looked murder at the old lady for a space, then bowed and
turned away.

“Here! Hoots! The callant’s in a creel!” she cried. “Think ye a spy?
what else would I think ye—me that kens naething by ye? But I see that
I was wrong; and as I cannot fight, I’ll have to apologise. A bonny
figure I would be with a broadsword. Ay! ay!” she went on, “you’re none
such a bad lad in your way; I think ye’ll have some redeeming vices.
But, O! Davit Balfour, ye’re damned countryfeed. Ye’ll have to win over
that, lad; ye’ll have to soople your back-bone, and think a wee pickle
less of your dainty self; and ye’ll have to try to find out that
women-folk are nae grenadiers. But that can never be. To your last day
you’ll ken no more of women-folk than what I do of sow-gelding.”

I had never been used with such expressions from a lady’s tongue, the
only two ladies I had known, Mrs. Campbell and my mother, being most
devout and most particular women; and I suppose my amazement must have
been depicted in my countenance, for Mrs. Ogilvy burst forth suddenly
in a fit of laughter.

“Keep me!” she cried, struggling with her mirth, “you have the finest
timber face—and you to marry the daughter of a Hieland cateran! Davie,
my dear, I think we’ll have to make a match of it—if it was just to see
the weans. And now,” she went on, “there’s no manner of service in your
daidling here, for the young woman is from home, and it’s my fear that
the old woman is no suitable companion for your father’s son. Forbye
that I have nobody but myself to look after my reputation, and have
been long enough alone with a sedooctive youth. And come back another
day for your saxpence!” she cried after me as I left.

My skirmish with this disconcerting lady gave my thoughts a boldness
they had otherwise wanted. For two days the image of Catriona had mixed
in all my meditations; she made their background, so that I scarce
enjoyed my own company without a glint of her in a corner of my mind.
But now she came immediately near; I seemed to touch her, whom I had
never touched but the once; I let myself flow out to her in a happy
weakness, and looking all about, and before and behind, saw the world
like an undesirable desert, where men go as soldiers on a march,
following their duty with what constancy they have, and Catriona alone
there to offer me some pleasure of my days. I wondered at myself that I
could dwell on such considerations in that time of my peril and
disgrace; and when I remembered my youth I was ashamed. I had my
studies to complete: I had to be called into some useful business; I
had yet to take my part of service in a place where all must serve; I
had yet to learn, and know, and prove myself a man; and I had so much
sense as blush that I should be already tempted with these further-on
and holier delights and duties. My education spoke home to me sharply;
I was never brought up on sugar biscuits but on the hard food of the
truth. I knew that he was quite unfit to be a husband who was not
prepared to be a father also; and for a boy like me to play the father
was a mere derision.

When I was in the midst of these thoughts and about half-way back to
town I saw a figure coming to meet me, and the trouble of my heart was
heightened. It seemed I had everything in the world to say to her, but
nothing to say first; and remembering how tongue-tied I had been that
morning at the Advocate’s I made sure that I would find myself struck
dumb. But when she came up my fears fled away; not even the
consciousness of what I had been privately thinking disconcerted me the
least; and I found I could talk with her as easily and rationally as I
might with Alan.

“O!” she cried, “you have been seeking your sixpence; did you get it?”

I told her no; but now I had met with her my walk was not in vain.
“Though I have seen you to-day already,” said I, and told her where and
when.

“I did not see you,” she said. “My eyes are big, but there are better
than mine at seeing far. Only I heard singing in the house.”

“That was Miss Grant,” said I, “the eldest and the bonniest.”

“They say they are all beautiful,” said she.

“They think the same of you, Miss Drummond,” I replied, “and were all
crowding to the window to observe you.”

“It is a pity about my being so blind,” said she, “or I might have seen
them too. And you were in the house? You must have been having the fine
time with the fine music and the pretty ladies.”

“There is just where you are wrong,” said I; “for I was as uncouth as a
sea-fish upon the brae of a mountain. The truth is that I am better
fitted to go about with rudas men than pretty ladies.”

“Well, I would think so too, at all events!” said she, at which we both
of us laughed.

“It is a strange thing, now,” said I. “I am not the least afraid with
you, yet I could have run from the Miss Grants. And I was afraid of
your cousin too.”

“O, I think any man will be afraid of her,” she cried. “My father is
afraid of her himself.”

The name of her father brought me to a stop. I looked at her as she
walked by my side; I recalled the man, and the little I knew and the
much I guessed of him; and comparing the one with the other, felt like
a traitor to be silent.

“Speaking of which,” said I, “I met your father no later than this
morning.”

“Did you?” she cried, with a voice of joy that seemed to mock at me.
“You saw James More? You will have spoken with him then?”

“I did even that,” said I.

Then I think things went the worst way for me that was humanly
possible. She gave me a look of mere gratitude. “Ah, thank you for
that!” says she.

“You thank me for very little,” said I, and then stopped. But it seemed
when I was holding back so much, something at least had to come out. “I
spoke rather ill to him,” said I; “I did no like him very much; I spoke
him rather ill, and he was angry.”

“I think you had little to do then, and less to tell it to his
daughter!” she cried out. “But those that do not love and cherish him I
will not know.”

“I will take the freedom of a word yet,” said I, beginning to tremble.
“Perhaps neither your father nor I are in the best of spirits at
Prestongrange’s. I daresay we both have anxious business there, for
it’s a dangerous house. I was sorry for him too, and spoke to him the
first, if I could but have spoken the wiser. And for one thing, in my
opinion, you will soon find that his affairs are mending.”

“It will not be through your friendship, I am thinking,” said she; “and
he is much made up to you for your sorrow.”

“Miss Drummond,” cried I, “I am alone in this world.”

“And I am not wondering at that,” said she.

“O, let me speak!” said I. “I will speak but the once, and then leave
you, if you will, for ever. I came this day in the hopes of a kind word
that I am sore in want of. I know that what I said must hurt you, and I
knew it then. It would have been easy to have spoken smooth, easy to
lie to you; can you not think how I was tempted to the same? Cannot you
see the truth of my heart shine out?”

“I think here is a great deal of work, Mr. Balfour,” said she. “I think
we will have met but the once, and will can part like gentle folk.”

“O, let me have one to believe in me!” I pleaded, “I cannae bear it
else. The whole world is clanned against me. How am I to go through
with my dreadful fate? If there’s to be none to believe in me I cannot
do it. The man must just die, for I cannot do it.”

She had still looked straight in front of her, head in air; but at my
words or the tone of my voice she came to a stop. “What is this you
say?” she asked. “What are you talking of?”

“It is my testimony which may save an innocent life,” said I, “and they
will not suffer me to bear it. What would you do yourself? You know
what this is, whose father lies in danger. Would you desert the poor
soul? They have tried all ways with me. They have sought to bribe me;
they offered me hills and valleys. And to-day that sleuth-hound told me
how I stood, and to what a length he would go to butcher and disgrace
me. I am to be brought in a party to the murder; I am to have held
Glenure in talk for money and old clothes; I am to be killed and
shamed. If this is the way I am to fall, and me scarce a man—if this is
the story to be told of me in all Scotland—if you are to believe it
too, and my name is to be nothing but a by-word—Catriona, how can I go
through with it? The thing’s not possible; it’s more than a man has in
his heart.”

I poured my words out in a whirl, one upon the other; and when I
stopped I found her gazing on me with a startled face.

“Glenure! It is the Appin murder,” she said softly, but with a very
deep surprise.

I had turned back to bear her company, and we were now come near the
head of the brae above Dean village. At this word I stepped in front of
her like one suddenly distracted.

“For God’s sake!” I cried, “for God’s sake, what is this that I have
done?” and carried my fists to my temples. “What made me do it? Sure, I
am bewitched to say these things!”

“In the name of heaven, what ails you now!” she cried.

“I gave my honour,” I groaned, “I gave my honour and now I have broke
it. O, Catriona!”

“I am asking you what it is,” she said; “was it these things you should
not have spoken? And do you think I have no honour, then? or that I am
one that would betray a friend? I hold up my right hand to you and
swear.”

“O, I knew you would be true!” said I. “It’s me—it’s here. I that stood
but this morning and out-faced them, that risked rather to die
disgraced upon the gallows than do wrong—and a few hours after I throw
my honour away by the roadside in common talk! ‘There is one thing
clear upon our interview,’ says he, ‘that I can rely on your pledged
word.’ Where is my word now? Who could believe me now? You could not
believe me. I am clean fallen down; I had best die!” All this I said
with a weeping voice, but I had no tears in my body.

“My heart is sore for you,” said she, “but be sure you are too nice. I
would not believe you, do you say? I would trust you with anything. And
these men? I would not be thinking of them! Men who go about to entrap
and to destroy you! Fy! this is no time to crouch. Look up! Do you not
think I will be admiring you like a great hero of the good—and you a
boy not much older than myself? And because you said a word too much in
a friend’s ear, that would die ere she betrayed you—to make such a
matter! It is one thing that we must both forget.”

“Catriona,” said I, looking at her, hang-dog, “is this true of it?
Would ye trust me yet?”

“Will you not believe the tears upon my face?” she cried. “It is the
world I am thinking of you, Mr. David Balfour. Let them hang you; I
will never forget, I will grow old and still remember you. I think it
is great to die so: I will envy you that gallows.”

“And maybe all this while I am but a child frighted with bogles,” said
I. “Maybe they but make a mock of me.”

“It is what I must know,” she said. “I must hear the whole. The harm is
done at all events, and I must hear the whole.”

I had sat down on the wayside, where she took a place beside me, and I
told her all that matter much as I have written it, my thoughts about
her father’s dealings being alone omitted.

“Well,” she said, when I had finished, “you are a hero, surely, and I
never would have thought that same! And I think you are in peril, too.
O, Simon Fraser! to think upon that man! For his life and the dirty
money, to be dealing in such traffic!” And just then she called out
aloud with a queer word that was common with her, and belongs, I
believe, to her own language. “My torture!” says she, “look at the
sun!”

Indeed, it was already dipping towards the mountains.

She bid me come again soon, gave me her hand, and left me in a turmoil
of glad spirits. I delayed to go home to my lodging, for I had a terror
of immediate arrest; but got some supper at a change house, and the
better part of that night walked by myself in the barley-fields, and
had such a sense of Catriona’s presence that I seemed to bear her in my
arms.




CHAPTER VIII.
THE BRAVO


The next day, August 29th, I kept my appointment at the Advocate’s in a
coat that I had made to my own measure, and was but newly ready.

“Aha,” says Prestongrange, “you are very fine to-day; my misses are to
have a fine cavalier. Come, I take that kind of you. I take that kind
of you, Mr. David. O, we shall do very well yet, and I believe your
troubles are nearly at an end.”

“You have news for me?” cried I.

“Beyond anticipation,” he replied. “Your testimony is after all to be
received; and you may go, if you will, in my company to the trial,
which in to be held at Inverary, Thursday, 21st _proximo_.”

I was too much amazed to find words.

“In the meanwhile,” he continued, “though I will not ask you to renew
your pledge, I must caution you strictly to be reticent. To-morrow your
precognition must be taken; and outside of that, do you know, I think
least said will be soonest mended.”

“I shall try to go discreetly,” said I. “I believe it is yourself that
I must thank for this crowning mercy, and I do thank you gratefully.
After yesterday, my lord, this is like the doors of Heaven. I cannot
find it in my heart to get the thing believed.”

“Ah, but you must try and manage, you must try and manage to believe
it,” says he, soothing-like, “and I am very glad to hear your
acknowledgment of obligation, for I think you may be able to repay me
very shortly”—he coughed—“or even now. The matter is much changed. Your
testimony, which I shall not trouble you for to-day, will doubtless
alter the complexion of the case for all concerned, and this makes it
less delicate for me to enter with you on a side issue.”

“My Lord,” I interrupted, “excuse me for interrupting you, but how has
this been brought about? The obstacles you told me of on Saturday
appeared even to me to be quite insurmountable; how has it been
contrived?”

“My dear Mr. David,” said he, “it would never do for me to divulge
(even to you, as you say) the councils of the Government; and you must
content yourself, if you please, with the gross fact.”

He smiled upon me like a father as he spoke, playing the while with a
new pen; methought it was impossible there could be any shadow of
deception in the man: yet when he drew to him a sheet of paper, dipped
his pen among the ink, and began again to address me, I was somehow not
so certain, and fell instinctively into an attitude of guard.

“There is a point I wish to touch upon,” he began. “I purposely left it
before upon one side, which need be now no longer necessary. This is
not, of course, a part of your examination, which is to follow by
another hand; this is a private interest of my own. You say you
encountered Alan Breck upon the hill?”

“I did, my lord,” said I.

“This was immediately after the murder?”

“It was.”

“Did you speak to him?”

“I did.”

“You had known him before, I think?” says my lord, carelessly.

“I cannot guess your reason for so thinking, my lord,” I replied, “but
such in the fact.”

“And when did you part with him again?” said he.

“I reserve my answer,” said I. “The question will be put to me at the
assize.”

“Mr. Balfour,” said he, “will you not understand that all this is
without prejudice to yourself? I have promised you life and honour;
and, believe me, I can keep my word. You are therefore clear of all
anxiety. Alan, it appears, you suppose you can protect; and you talk to
me of your gratitude, which I think (if you push me) is not
ill-deserved. There are a great many different considerations all
pointing the same way; and I will never be persuaded that you could not
help us (if you chose) to put salt on Alan’s tail.”

“My lord,” said I, “I give you my word I do not so much as guess where
Alan is.”

He paused a breath. “Nor how he might be found?” he asked.

I sat before him like a log of wood.

“And so much for your gratitude, Mr. David!” he observed. Again there
was a piece of silence. “Well,” said he, rising, “I am not fortunate,
and we are a couple at cross purposes. Let us speak of it no more; you
will receive notice when, where, and by whom, we are to take your
precognition. And in the meantime, my misses must be waiting you. They
will never forgive me if I detain their cavalier.”

Into the hands of these Graces I was accordingly offered up, and found
them dressed beyond what I had thought possible, and looking fair as a
posy.

As we went forth from the doors a small circumstance occurred which
came afterwards to look extremely big. I heard a whistle sound loud and
brief like a signal, and looking all about, spied for one moment the
red head of Neil of the Tom, the son of Duncan. The next moment he was
gone again, nor could I see so much as the skirt-tail of Catriona, upon
whom I naturally supposed him to be then attending.

My three keepers led me out by Bristo and the Bruntsfield Links; whence
a path carried us to Hope Park, a beautiful pleasance, laid with
gravel-walks, furnished with seats and summer-sheds, and warded by a
keeper. The way there was a little longsome; the two younger misses
affected an air of genteel weariness that damped me cruelly, the eldest
considered me with something that at times appeared like mirth; and
though I thought I did myself more justice than the day before, it was
not without some effort. Upon our reaching the park I was launched on a
bevy of eight or ten young gentlemen (some of them cockaded officers,
the rest chiefly advocates) who crowded to attend upon these beauties;
and though I was presented to all of them in very good words, it seemed
I was by all immediately forgotten. Young folk in a company are like to
savage animals: they fall upon or scorn a stranger without civility, or
I may say, humanity; and I am sure, if I had been among baboons, they
would have shown me quite as much of both. Some of the advocates set up
to be wits, and some of the soldiers to be rattles; and I could not
tell which of these extremes annoyed me most. All had a manner of
handling their swords and coat-skirts, for the which (in mere black
envy) I could have kicked them from the park. I daresay, upon their
side, they grudged me extremely the fine company in which I had
arrived; and altogether I had soon fallen behind, and stepped stiffly
in the rear of all that merriment with my own thoughts.

From these I was recalled by one of the officers, Lieutenant Hector
Duncansby, a gawky, leering Highland boy, asking if my name was not
“Palfour.”

I told him it was, not very kindly, for his manner was scant civil.

“Ha, Palfour,” says he, and then, repeating it, “Palfour, Palfour!”

“I am afraid you do not like my name, sir,” says I, annoyed with myself
to be annoyed with such a rustical fellow.

“No,” says he, “but I wass thinking.”

“I would not advise you to make a practice of that, sir,” says I. “I
feel sure you would not find it to agree with you.”

“Tit you effer hear where Alan Grigor fand the tangs?” said he.

I asked him what he could possibly mean, and he answered, with a
heckling laugh, that he thought I must have found the poker in the same
place and swallowed it.

There could be no mistake about this, and my cheek burned.

“Before I went about to put affronts on gentlemen,” said I, “I think I
would learn the English language first.”

He took me by the sleeve with a nod and a wink and led me quietly
outside Hope Park. But no sooner were we beyond the view of the
promenaders, than the fashion of his countenance changed. “You tam
lowland scoon’rel!” cries he, and hit me a buffet on the jaw with his
closed fist.

I paid him as good or better on the return; whereupon he stepped a
little back and took off his hat to me decorously.

“Enough plows I think,” says he. “I will be the offended shentleman,
for who effer heard of such suffeeciency as tell a shentlemans that is
the king’s officer he cannae speak Cot’s English? We have swords at our
hurdles, and here is the King’s Park at hand. Will ye walk first, or
let me show ye the way?”

I returned his bow, told him to go first, and followed him. As he went
I heard him grumble to himself about _Cot’s English_ and the _King’s
coat_, so that I might have supposed him to be seriously offended. But
his manner at the beginning of our interview was there to belie him. It
was manifest he had come prepared to fasten a quarrel on me, right or
wrong; manifest that I was taken in a fresh contrivance of my enemies;
and to me (conscious as I was of my deficiencies) manifest enough that
I should be the one to fall in our encounter.

As we came into that rough rocky desert of the King’s Park I was
tempted half-a-dozen times to take to my heels and run for it, so loath
was I to show my ignorance in fencing, and so much averse to die or
even to be wounded. But I considered if their malice went as far as
this, it would likely stick at nothing; and that to fall by the sword,
however ungracefully, was still an improvement on the gallows. I
considered besides that by the unguarded pertness of my words and the
quickness of my blow I had put myself quite out of court; and that even
if I ran, my adversary would probably pursue and catch me, which would
add disgrace to my misfortune. So that, taking all in all, I continued
marching behind him, much as a man follows the hangman, and certainly
with no more hope.

We went about the end of the long craigs, and came into the Hunter’s
Bog. Here, on a piece of fair turf, my adversary drew. There was nobody
there to see us but some birds; and no resource for me but to follow
his example, and stand on guard with the best face I could display. It
seems it was not good enough for Mr. Dancansby, who spied some flaw in
my manœuvres, paused, looked upon me sharply, and came off and on, and
menaced me with his blade in the air. As I had seen no such proceedings
from Alan, and was besides a good deal affected with the proximity of
death, I grew quite bewildered, stood helpless, and could have longed
to run away.

“Fat deil ails her?” cries the lieutenant.

And suddenly engaging, he twitched the sword out of my grasp and sent
it flying far among the rushes.

Twice was this manœuvre repeated; and the third time when I brought
back my humiliated weapon, I found he had returned his own to the
scabbard, and stood awaiting me with a face of some anger, and his
hands clasped under his skirt.

“Pe tamned if I touch you!” he cried, and asked me bitterly what right
I had to stand up before “shentlemans” when I did not know the back of
a sword from the front of it.

I answered that was the fault of my upbringing; and would he do me the
justice to say I had given him all the satisfaction it was
unfortunately in my power to offer, and had stood up like a man?

“And that is the truth,” said he. “I am fery prave myself, and pold as
a lions. But to stand up there—and you ken naething of fence!—the way
that you did, I declare it was peyond me. And I am sorry for the plow;
though I declare I pelief your own was the elder brother, and my heid
still sings with it. And I declare if I had kent what way it wass, I
would not put a hand to such a piece of pusiness.”

“That is handsomely said,” I replied, “and I am sure you will not stand
up a second time to be the actor for my private enemies.”

“Indeed, no, Palfour,” said he; “and I think I was used extremely
suffeeciently myself to be set up to fecht with an auld wife, or all
the same as a bairn whateffer! And I will tell the Master so, and fecht
him, by Cot, himself!”

“And if you knew the nature of Mr. Simon’s quarrel with me,” said I,
“you would be yet the more affronted to be mingled up with such
affairs.”

He swore he could well believe it; that all the Lovats were made of the
same meal and the devil was the miller that ground that; then suddenly
shaking me by the hand, he vowed I was a pretty enough fellow after
all, that it was a thousand pities I had been neglected, and that if he
could find the time, he would give an eye himself to have me educated.

“You can do me a better service than even what you propose,” said I;
and when he had asked its nature—“Come with me to the house of one of
my enemies, and testify how I have carried myself this day,” I told
him. “That will be the true service. For though he has sent me a
gallant adversary for the first, the thought in Mr. Simon’s mind is
merely murder. There will be a second and then a third; and by what you
have seen of my cleverness with the cold steel, you can judge for
yourself what is like to be the upshot.”

“And I would not like it myself, if I was no more of a man than what
you wass!” he cried. “But I will do you right, Palfour. Lead on!”

If I had walked slowly on the way into that accursed park my heels were
light enough on the way out. They kept time to a very good old air,
that is as ancient as the Bible, and the words of it are: “_Surely the
bitterness of death is passed_.” I mind that I was extremely thirsty,
and had a drink at Saint Margaret’s well on the road down, and the
sweetness of that water passed belief. We went through the sanctuary,
up the Canongate, in by the Netherbow, and straight to Prestongrange’s
door, talking as we came and arranging the details of our affair. The
footman owned his master was at home, but declared him engaged with
other gentlemen on very private business, and his door forbidden.

“My business is but for three minutes, and it cannot wait,” said I.
“You may say it is by no means private, and I shall be even glad to
have some witnesses.”

As the man departed unwillingly enough upon this errand, we made so
bold as to follow him to the ante-chamber, whence I could hear for a
while the murmuring of several voices in the room within. The truth is,
they were three at the one table—Prestongrange, Simon Fraser, and Mr.
Erskine, Sheriff of Perth; and as they were met in consultation on the
very business of the Appin murder, they were a little disturbed at my
appearance, but decided to receive me.

“Well, well, Mr. Balfour, and what brings you here again? and who is
this you bring with you?” says Prestongrange.

As for Fraser, he looked before him on the table.

“He is here to bear a little testimony in my favour, my lord, which I
think it very needful you should hear,” said I, and turned to
Duncansby.

“I have only to say this,” said the lieutenant, “that I stood up this
day with Palfour in the Hunter’s Pog, which I am now fery sorry for,
and he behaved himself as pretty as a shentlemans could ask it. And I
have creat respects for Palfour,” he added.

“I thank you for your honest expressions,” said I.

Whereupon Duncansby made his bow to the company, and left the chamber,
as we had agreed upon before.

“What have I to do with this?” says Prestongrange.

“I will tell your lordship in two words,” said I. “I have brought this
gentleman, a King’s officer, to do me so much justice. Now I think my
character is covered, and until a certain date, which your lordship can
very well supply, it will be quite in vain to despatch against me any
more officers. I will not consent to fight my way through the garrison
of the castle.”

The veins swelled on Prestongrange’s brow, and he regarded me with
fury.

“I think the devil uncoupled this dog of a lad between my legs!” he
cried; and then, turning fiercely on his neighbour, “This is some of
your work, Simon,” he said. “I spy your hand in the business, and, let
me tell you, I resent it. It is disloyal, when we are agreed upon one
expedient, to follow another in the dark. You are disloyal to me. What!
you let me send this lad to the place with my very daughters! And
because I let drop a word to you..... Fy, sir, keep your dishonours to
yourself!”

Simon was deadly pale. “I will be a kick-ball between you and the Duke
no longer,” he exclaimed. “Either come to an agreement, or come to a
differ, and have it out among yourselves. But I will no longer fetch
and carry, and get your contrary instructions, and be blamed by both.
For if I were to tell you what I think of all your Hanover business it
would make your head sing.”

But Sheriff Erskine had preserved his temper, and now intervened
smoothly. “And in the meantime,” says he, “I think we should tell Mr.
Balfour that his character for valour is quite established. He may
sleep in peace. Until the date he was so good as to refer to it shall
be put to the proof no more.”

His coolness brought the others to their prudence; and they made haste,
with a somewhat distracted civility, to pack me from the house.




CHAPTER IX.
THE HEATHER ON FIRE


When I left Prestongrange that afternoon I was for the first time
angry. The Advocate had made a mock of me. He had pretended my
testimony was to be received and myself respected; and in that very
hour, not only was Simon practising against my life by the hands of the
Highland soldier, but (as appeared from his own language) Prestongrange
himself had some design in operation. I counted my enemies;
Prestongrange with all the King’s authority behind him; and the Duke
with the power of the West Highlands; and the Lovat interest by their
side to help them with so great a force in the north, and the whole
clan of old Jacobite spies and traffickers. And when I remembered James
More, and the red head of Neil the son of Duncan, I thought there was
perhaps a fourth in the confederacy, and what remained of Rob Roy’s old
desperate sept of caterans would be banded against me with the others.
One thing was requisite—some strong friend or wise adviser. The country
must be full of such, both able and eager to support me, or Lovat and
the Duke and Prestongrange had not been nosing for expedients; and it
made me rage to think that I might brush against my champions in the
street and be no wiser.

And just then (like an answer) a gentleman brushed against me going by,
gave me a meaning look, and turned into a close. I knew him with the
tail of my eye—it was Stewart the Writer; and, blessing my good
fortune, turned in to follow him. As soon as I had entered the close I
saw him standing in the mouth of a stair, where he made me a signal and
immediately vanished. Seven storeys up, there he was again in a house
door, the which he looked behind us after we had entered. The house was
quite dismantled, with not a stick of furniture; indeed, it was one of
which Stewart had the letting in his hands.

“We’ll have to sit upon the floor,” said he; “but we’re safe here for
the time being, and I’ve been wearying to see ye, Mr. Balfour.”

“How’s it with Alan?” I asked.

“Brawly,” said he. “Andie picks him up at Gillane sands to-morrow,
Wednesday. He was keen to say good-bye to ye, but the way that things
were going, I was feared the pair of ye was maybe best apart. And that
brings me to the essential: how does your business speed?”

“Why,” said I, “I was told only this morning that my testimony was
accepted, and I was to travel to Inverary with the Advocate, no less.”

“Hout awa!” cried Stewart. “I’ll never believe that.”

“I have maybe a suspicion of my own,” says I, “but I would like fine to
hear your reasons.”

“Well, I tell ye fairly, I’m horn-mad,” cries Stewart. “If my one hand
could pull their Government down I would pluck it like a rotten apple.
I’m doer for Appin and for James of the Glens; and, of course, it’s my
duty to defend my kinsman for his life. Hear how it goes with me, and
I’ll leave the judgment of it to yourself. The first thing they have to
do is to get rid of Alan. They cannae bring in James as art and part
until they’ve brought in Alan first as principal; that’s sound law:
they could never put the cart before the horse.”

“And how are they to bring in Alan till they can catch him?” says I.

“Ah, but there is a way to evite that arrestment,” said he. “Sound law,
too. It would be a bonny thing if, by the escape of one ill-doer
another was to go scatheless, and the remeid is to summon the principal
and put him to outlawry for the non-compearance. Now there’s four
places where a person can be summoned: at his dwelling-house; at a
place where he has resided forty days; at the head burgh of the shire
where he ordinarily resorts; or lastly (if there be ground to think him
forth of Scotland) _at the cross of Edinburgh_, _and the pier and shore
of Leith_, _for sixty days_. The purpose of which last provision is
evident upon its face: being that outgoing ships may have time to carry
news of the transaction, and the summonsing be something other than a
form. Now take the case of Alan. He has no dwelling-house that ever I
could hear of; I would be obliged if anyone would show me where he has
lived forty days together since the ’45; there is no shire where he
resorts whether ordinarily or extraordinarily; if he has a domicile at
all, which I misdoubt, it must be with his regiment in France; and if
he is not yet forth of Scotland (as we happen to know and they happen
to guess) it must be evident to the most dull it’s what he’s aiming
for. Where, then, and what way should he be summoned? I ask it at
yourself, a layman.”

“You have given the very words,” said I. “Here at the cross, and at the
pier and shore of Leith, for sixty days.”

“Ye’re a sounder Scots lawyer than Prestongrange, then!” cries the
Writer. “He has had Alan summoned once; that was on the twenty-fifth,
the day that we first met. Once, and done with it. And where? Where,
but at the cross of Inverary, the head burgh of the Campbells? A word
in your ear, Mr. Balfour—they’re not seeking Alan.”

“What do you mean?” I cried. “Not seeking him?”

“By the best that I can make of it,” said he. “Not wanting to find him,
in my poor thought. They think perhaps he might set up a fair defence,
upon the back of which James, the man they’re really after, might climb
out. This is not a case, ye see, it’s a conspiracy.”

“Yet I can tell you Prestongrange asked after Alan keenly,” said I;
“though, when I come to think of it, he was something of the easiest
put by.”

“See that!” says he. “But there! I may be right or wrong, that’s
guesswork at the best, and let me get to my facts again. It comes to my
ears that James and the witnesses—the witnesses, Mr. Balfour!—lay in
close dungeons, and shackled forbye, in the military prison at Fort
William; none allowed in to them, nor they to write. The witnesses, Mr.
Balfour; heard ye ever the match of that? I assure ye, no old, crooked
Stewart of the gang ever out-faced the law more impudently. It’s clean
in the two eyes of the Act of Parliament of 1700, anent wrongous
imprisonment. No sooner did I get the news than I petitioned the Lord
Justice Clerk. I have his word to-day. There’s law for ye! here’s
justice!”

He put a paper in my hand, that same mealy-mouthed, false-faced paper
that was printed since in the pamphlet “by a bystander,” for behoof (as
the title says) of James’s “poor widow and five children.”

“See,” said Stewart, “he couldn’t dare to refuse me access to my
client, so he _recommends the commanding officer to let me in_.
Recommends!—the Lord Justice Clerk of Scotland recommends. Is not the
purpose of such language plain? They hope the officer may be so dull,
or so very much the reverse, as to refuse the recommendation. I would
have to make the journey back again betwixt here and Fort William. Then
would follow a fresh delay till I got fresh authority, and they had
disavowed the officer—military man, notoriously ignorant of the law,
and that—I ken the cant of it. Then the journey a third time; and there
we should be on the immediate heels of the trial before I had received
my first instruction. Am I not right to call this a conspiracy?”

“It will bear that colour,” said I.

“And I’ll go on to prove it you outright,” said he. “They have the
right to hold James in prison, yet they cannot deny me to visit him.
They have no right to hold the witnesses; but am I to get a sight of
them, that should be as free as the Lord Justice Clerk himself!
See—read: _For the rest_, _refuses to give any orders to keepers of
prisons who are not accused as having done anything contrary to the
duties of their office_. Anything contrary! Sirs! And the Act of
seventeen hunner? Mr. Balfour, this makes my heart to burst; the
heather is on fire inside my wame.”

“And the plain English of that phrase,” said I, “is that the witnesses
are still to lie in prison and you are not to see them?”

“And I am not to see them until Inverary, when the court is set!” cries
he, “and then to hear Prestongrange upon _the anxious responsibilities
of his office and the great facilities afforded the defence_! But I’ll
begowk them there, Mr. David. I have a plan to waylay the witnesses
upon the road, and see if I cannae get I a little harle of justice out
of the _military man notoriously ignorant of the law_ that shall
command the party.”

It was actually so—it was actually on the wayside near Tynedrum, and by
the connivance of a soldier officer, that Mr. Stewart first saw the
witnesses upon the case.

“There is nothing that would surprise me in this business,” I remarked.

“I’ll surprise you ere I’m done!” cries he. “Do ye see this?”—producing
a print still wet from the press. “This is the libel: see, there’s
Prestongrange’s name to the list of witnesses, and I find no word of
any Balfour. But here is not the question. Who do ye think paid for the
printing of this paper?”

“I suppose it would likely be King George,” said I.

“But it happens it was me!” he cried. “Not but it was printed by and
for themselves, for the Grants and the Erskines, and yon thief of the
black midnight, Simon Fraser. But could _I_ win to get a copy! No! I
was to go blindfold to my defence; I was to hear the charges for the
first time in court alongst the jury.”

“Is not this against the law?” I asked.

“I cannot say so much,” he replied. “It was a favour so natural and so
constantly rendered (till this nonesuch business) that the law has
never looked to it. And now admire the hand of Providence! A stranger
is in Fleming’s printing house, spies a proof on the floor, picks it
up, and carries it to me. Of all things, it was just this libel.
Whereupon I had it set again—printed at the expense of the defence:
_sumptibus moesti rei_; heard ever man the like of it?—and here it is
for anybody, the muckle secret out—all may see it now. But how do you
think I would enjoy this, that has the life of my kinsman on my
conscience?”

“Troth, I think you would enjoy it ill,” said I.

“And now you see how it is,” he concluded, “and why, when you tell me
your evidence is to be let in, I laugh aloud in your face.”

It was now my turn. I laid before him in brief Mr. Simon’s threats and
offers, and the whole incident of the bravo, with the subsequent scene
at Prestongrange’s. Of my first talk, according to promise, I said
nothing, nor indeed was it necessary. All the time I was talking
Stewart nodded his head like a mechanical figure; and no sooner had my
voice ceased, than he opened his mouth and gave me his opinion in two
words, dwelling strong on both of them.

“Disappear yourself,” said he.

“I do not take you,” said I.

“Then I’ll carry you there,” said he. “By my view of it you’re to
disappear whatever. O, that’s outside debate. The Advocate, who is not
without some spunks of a remainder decency, has wrung your life-safe
out of Simon and the Duke. He has refused to put you on your trial, and
refused to have you killed; and there is the clue to their ill words
together, for Simon and the Duke can keep faith with neither friend nor
enemy. Ye’re not to be tried then, and ye’re not to be murdered; but
I’m in bitter error if ye’re not to be kidnapped and carried away like
the Lady Grange. Bet me what ye please—there was their _expedient_!”

“You make me think,” said I, and told him of the whistle and the
red-headed retainer, Neil.

“Wherever James More is there’s one big rogue, never be deceived on
that,” said he. “His father was none so ill a man, though a kenning on
the wrong side of the law, and no friend to my family, that I should
waste my breath to be defending him! But as for James he’s a brock and
a blagyard. I like the appearance of this red-headed Neil as little as
yourself. It looks uncanny: fiegh! it smells bad. It was old Lovat that
managed the Lady Grange affair; if young Lovat is to handle yours,
it’ll be all in the family. What’s James More in prison for? The same
offence: abduction. His men have had practice in the business. He’ll be
to lend them to be Simon’s instruments; and the next thing we’ll be
hearing, James will have made his peace, or else he’ll have escaped;
and you’ll be in Benbecula or Applecross.”

“Ye make a strong case,” I admitted.

“And what I want,” he resumed, “is that you should disappear yourself
ere they can get their hands upon ye. Lie quiet until just before the
trial, and spring upon them at the last of it when they’ll be looking
for you least. This is always supposing Mr. Balfour, that your evidence
is worth so very great a measure of both risk and fash.”

“I will tell you one thing,” said I. “I saw the murderer and it was not
Alan.”

“Then, by God, my cousin’s saved!” cried Stewart. “You have his life
upon your tongue; and there’s neither time, risk, nor money to be
spared to bring you to the trial.” He emptied his pockets on the floor.
“Here is all that I have by me,” he went on, “Take it, ye’ll want it
ere ye’re through. Go straight down this close, there’s a way out by
there to the Lang Dykes, and by my will of it! see no more of Edinburgh
till the clash is over.”

“Where am I to go, then?” I inquired.

“And I wish that I could tell ye!” says he, “but all the places that I
could send ye to, would be just the places they would seek. No, ye must
fend for yourself, and God be your guiding! Five days before the trial,
September the sixteen, get word to me at the _King’s Arms_ in Stirling;
and if ye’ve managed for yourself as long as that, I’ll see that ye
reach Inverary.”

“One thing more,” said I. “Can I no see Alan?”

He seemed boggled. “Hech, I would rather you wouldnae,” said he. “But I
can never deny that Alan is extremely keen of it, and is to lie this
night by Silvermills on purpose. If you’re sure that you’re not
followed, Mr. Balfour—but make sure of that—lie in a good place and
watch your road for a clear hour before ye risk it. It would be a
dreadful business if both you and him was to miscarry!”




CHAPTER X.
THE RED-HEADED MAN


It was about half-past three when I came forth on the Lang Dykes. Dean
was where I wanted to go. Since Catriona dwelled there, and her
kinsfolk the Glengyle Macgregors appeared almost certainly to be
employed against me, it was just one of the few places I should have
kept away from; and being a very young man, and beginning to be very
much in love, I turned my face in that direction without pause. As a
slave to my conscience and common sense, however, I took a measure of
precaution. Coming over the crown of a bit of a rise in the road, I
clapped down suddenly among the barley and lay waiting. After a while,
a man went by that looked to be a Highlandman, but I had never seen him
till that hour. Presently after came Neil of the red head. The next to
go past was a miller’s cart, and after that nothing but manifest
country people. Here was enough to have turned the most foolhardy from
his purpose, but my inclination ran too strong the other way. I argued
it out that if Neil was on that road, it was the right road to find him
in, leading direct to his chief’s daughter; as for the other
Highlandman, if I was to be startled off by every Highlandman I saw, I
would scarce reach anywhere. And having quite satisfied myself with
this disingenuous debate, I made the better speed of it, and came a
little after four to Mrs. Drumond-Ogilvy’s.

Both ladies were within the house; and upon my perceiving them together
by the open door, I plucked off my hat and said, “Here was a lad come
seeking saxpence,” which I thought might please the dowager.

Catriona ran out to greet me heartily, and, to my surprise, the old
lady seemed scarce less forward than herself. I learned long afterwards
that she had despatched a horseman by daylight to Rankeillor at the
Queensferry, whom she knew to be the doer for Shaws, and had then in
her pocket a letter from that good friend of mine, presenting, in the
most favourable view, my character and prospects. But had I read it I
could scarce have seen more clear in her designs. Maybe I was
_countryfeed_; at least, I was not so much so as she thought; and it
was even to my homespun wits, that she was bent to hammer up a match
between her cousin and a beardless boy that was something of a laird in
Lothian.

“Saxpence had better take his broth with us, Catrine,” says she. “Run
and tell the lasses.”

And for the little while we were alone was at a good deal of pains to
flatter me; always cleverly, always with the appearance of a banter,
still calling me Saxpence, but with such a turn that should rather
uplift me in my own opinion. When Catriona returned, the design became
if possible more obvious; and she showed off the girl’s advantages like
a horse-couper with a horse. My face flamed that she should think me so
obtuse. Now I would fancy the girl was being innocently made a show of,
and then I could have beaten the old carline wife with a cudgel; and
now, that perhaps these two had set their heads together to entrap me,
and at that I sat and gloomed betwixt them like the very image of
ill-will. At last the matchmaker had a better device, which was to
leave the pair of us alone. When my suspicions are anyway roused it is
sometimes a little the wrong side of easy to allay them. But though I
knew what breed she was of, and that was a breed of thieves, I could
never look in Catriona’s face and disbelieve her.

“I must not ask?” says she, eagerly, the same moment we were left
alone.

“Ah, but to-day I can talk with a free conscience,” I replied. “I am
lightened of my pledge, and indeed (after what has come and gone since
morning) I would not have renewed it were it asked.”

“Tell me,” she said. “My cousin will not be so long.”

So I told her the tale of the lieutenant from the first step to the
last of it, making it as mirthful as I could, and, indeed, there was
matter of mirth in that absurdity.

“And I think you will be as little fitted for the rudas men as for the
pretty ladies, after all!” says she, when I had done. “But what was
your father that he could not learn you to draw the sword! It is most
ungentle; I have not heard the match of that in anyone.”

“It is most misconvenient at least,” said I; “and I think my father
(honest man!) must have been wool-gathering to learn me Latin in the
place of it. But you see I do the best I can, and just stand up like
Lot’s wife and let them hammer at me.”

“Do you know what makes me smile?” said she. “Well, it is this. I am
made this way, that I should have been a man child. In my own thoughts
it is so I am always; and I go on telling myself about this thing that
is to befall and that. Then it comes to the place of the fighting, and
it comes over me that I am only a girl at all events, and cannot hold a
sword or give one good blow; and then I have to twist my story round
about, so that the fighting is to stop, and yet me have the best of it,
just like you and the lieutenant; and I am the boy that makes the fine
speeches all through, like Mr. David Balfour.”

“You are a bloodthirsty maid,” said I.

“Well, I know it is good to sew and spin, and to make samplers,” she
said, “but if you were to do nothing else in the great world, I think
you will say yourself it is a driech business; and it is not that I
want to kill, I think. Did ever you kill anyone?”

“That I have, as it chances. Two, no less, and me still a lad that
should be at the college,” said I. “But yet, in the look-back, I take
no shame for it.”

“But how did you feel, then—after it?” she asked.

‘”Deed, I sat down and grat like a bairn,” said I.

“I know that, too,” she cried. “I feel where these tears should come
from. And at any rate, I would not wish to kill, only to be Catherine
Douglas that put her arm through the staples of the bolt, where it was
broken. That is my chief hero. Would you not love to die so—for your
king?” she asked.

“Troth,” said I, “my affection for my king, God bless the puggy face of
him, is under more control; and I thought I saw death so near to me
this day already, that I am rather taken up with the notion of living.”

“Right,” she said, “the right mind of a man! Only you must learn arms;
I would not like to have a friend that cannot strike. But it will not
have been with the sword that you killed these two?”

“Indeed, no,” said I, “but with a pair of pistols. And a fortunate
thing it was the men were so near-hand to me, for I am about as clever
with the pistols as I am with the sword.”

So then she drew from me the story of our battle in the brig, which I
had omitted in my first account of my affairs.

“Yes,” said she, “you are brave. And your friend, I admire and love
him.”

“Well, and I think anyone would!” said I. “He has his faults like other
folk; but he is brave and staunch and kind, God bless him! That will be
a strange day when I forget Alan.” And the thought of him, and that it
was within my choice to speak with him that night, had almost overcome
me.

“And where will my head be gone that I have not told my news!” she
cried, and spoke of a letter from her father, bearing that she might
visit him to-morrow in the castle whither he was now transferred, and
that his affairs were mending. “You do not like to hear it,” said she.
“Will you judge my father and not know him?”

“I am a thousand miles from judging,” I replied. “And I give you my
word I do rejoice to know your heart is lightened. If my face fell at
all, as I suppose it must, you will allow this is rather an ill day for
compositions, and the people in power extremely ill persons to be
compounding with. I have Simon Fraser extremely heavy on my stomach
still.”

“Ah!” she cried, “you will not be evening these two; and you should
bear in mind that Prestongrange and James More, my father, are of the
one blood.”

“I never heard tell of that,” said I.

“It is rather singular how little you are acquainted with,” said she.
“One part may call themselves Grant, and one Macgregor, but they are
still of the same clan. They are all the sons of Alpin, from whom, I
think, our country has its name.”

“What country is that?” I asked.

“My country and yours,” said she.

“This is my day for discovering I think,” said I, “for I always thought
the name of it was Scotland.”

“Scotland is the name of what you call Ireland,” she replied. “But the
old ancient true name of this place that we have our foot-soles on, and
that our bones are made of, will be Alban. It was Alban they called it
when our forefathers will be fighting for it against Rome and
Alexander; and it is called so still in your own tongue that you
forget.”

“Troth,” said I, “and that I never learned!” For I lacked heart to take
her up about the Macedonian.

“But your fathers and mothers talked it, one generation with another,”
said she. “And it was sung about the cradles before you or me were ever
dreamed of; and your name remembers it still. Ah, if you could talk
that language you would find me another girl. The heart speaks in that
tongue.”

I had a meal with the two ladies, all very good, served in fine old
plate, and the wine excellent, for it seems that Mrs. Ogilvy was rich.
Our talk, too, was pleasant enough; but as soon as I saw the sun
decline sharply and the shadows to run out long, I rose to take my
leave. For my mind was now made up to say farewell to Alan; and it was
needful I should see the trysting wood, and reconnoitre it, by
daylight. Catriona came with me as far as to the garden gate.

“It is long till I see you now?” she asked.

“It is beyond my judging,” I replied. “It will be long, it may be
never.”

“It may be so,” said she. “And you are sorry?”

I bowed my head, looking upon her.

“So am I, at all events,” said she. “I have seen you but a small time,
but I put you very high. You are true, you are brave; in time I think
you will be more of a man yet. I will be proud to hear of that. If you
should speed worse, if it will come to fall as we are afraid—O well!
think you have the one friend. Long after you are dead and me an old
wife, I will be telling the bairns about David Balfour, and my tears
running. I will be telling how we parted, and what I said to you, and
did to you. _God go with you and guide you_, _prays your little
friend_: so I said—I will be telling them—and here is what I did.”

She took up my hand and kissed it. This so surprised my spirits that I
cried out like one hurt. The colour came strong in her face, and she
looked at me and nodded.

“O yes, Mr. David,” said she, “that is what I think of you. The head
goes with the lips.”

I could read in her face high spirit, and a chivalry like a brave
child’s; not anything besides. She kissed my hand, as she had kissed
Prince Charlie’s, with a higher passion than the common kind of clay
has any sense of. Nothing before had taught me how deep I was her
lover, nor how far I had yet to climb to make her think of me in such a
character. Yet I could tell myself I had advanced some way, and that
her heart had beat and her blood flowed at thoughts of me.

After that honour she had done me I could offer no more trivial
civility. It was even hard for me to speak; a certain lifting in her
voice had knocked directly at the door of my own tears.

“I praise God for your kindness, dear,” said I. “Farewell, my little
friend!” giving her that name which she had given to herself; with
which I bowed and left her.

My way was down the glen of the Leith River, towards Stockbridge and
Silvermills. A path led in the foot of it, the water bickered and sang
in the midst; the sunbeams overhead struck out of the west among long
shadows and (as the valley turned) made like a new scene and a new
world of it at every corner. With Catriona behind and Alan before me, I
was like one lifted up. The place besides, and the hour, and the
talking of the water, infinitely pleased me; and I lingered in my steps
and looked before and behind me as I went. This was the cause, under
Providence, that I spied a little in my rear a red head among some
bushes.

Anger sprang in my heart, and I turned straight about and walked at a
stiff pace to where I came from. The path lay close by the bushes where
I had remarked the head. The cover came to the wayside, and as I passed
I was all strung up to meet and to resist an onfall. No such thing
befell, I went by unmeddled with; and at that fear increased upon me.
It was still day indeed, but the place exceeding solitary. If my
haunters had let slip that fair occasion I could but judge they aimed
at something more than David Balfour. The lives of Alan and James
weighed upon my spirit with the weight of two grown bullocks.

Catriona was yet in the garden walking by herself.

“Catriona,” said I, “you see me back again.”

“With a changed face,” said she.

“I carry two men’s lives besides my own,” said I. “It would be a sin
and shame not to walk carefully. I was doubtful whether I did right to
come here. I would like it ill, if it was by that means we were brought
to harm.”

“I could tell you one that would be liking it less, and will like
little enough to hear you talking at this very same time,” she cried.
“What have I done, at all events?”

“O, you I you are not alone,” I replied. “But since I went off I have
been dogged again, and I can give you the name of him that follows me.
It is Neil, son of Duncan, your man or your father’s.”

“To be sure you are mistaken there,” she said, with a white face. “Neil
is in Edinburgh on errands from my father.”

“It is what I fear,” said I, “the last of it. But for his being in
Edinburgh I think I can show you another of that. For sure you have
some signal, a signal of need, such as would bring him to your help, if
he was anywhere within the reach of ears and legs?”

“Why, how will you know that?” says she.

“By means of a magical talisman God gave to me when I was born, and the
name they call it by is Common-sense,” said I. “Oblige me so far as
make your signal, and I will show you the red head of Neil.”

No doubt but I spoke bitter and sharp. My heart was bitter. I blamed
myself and the girl and hated both of us: her for the vile crew that
she was come of, myself for my wanton folly to have stuck my head in
such a byke of wasps.

Catriona set her fingers to her lips and whistled once, with an
exceeding clear, strong, mounting note, as full as a ploughman’s. A
while we stood silent; and I was about to ask her to repeat the same,
when I heard the sound of some one bursting through the bushes below on
the braeside. I pointed in that direction with a smile, and presently
Neil leaped into the garden. His eyes burned, and he had a black knife
(as they call it on the Highland side) naked in his hand; but, seeing
me beside his mistress, stood like a man struck.

“He has come to your call,” said I; “judge how near he was to
Edinburgh, or what was the nature of your father’s errands. Ask
himself. If I am to lose my life, or the lives of those that hang by
me, through the means of your clan, let me go where I have to go with
my eyes open.”

She addressed him tremulously in the Gaelic. Remembering Alan’s anxious
civility in that particular, I could have laughed out loud for
bitterness; here, sure, in the midst of these suspicions, was the hour
she should have stuck by English.

Twice or thrice they spoke together, and I could make out that Neil
(for all his obsequiousness) was an angry man.

Then she turned to me. “He swears it is not,” she said.

“Catriona,” said I, “do you believe the man yourself?”

She made a gesture like wringing the hands.

“How will I can know?” she cried.

“But I must find some means to know,” said I. “I cannot continue to go
dovering round in the black night with two men’s lives at my girdle!
Catriona, try to put yourself in my place, as I vow to God I try hard
to put myself in yours. This is no kind of talk that should ever have
fallen between me and you; no kind of talk; my heart is sick with it.
See, keep him here till two of the morning, and I care not. Try him
with that.”

They spoke together once more in the Gaelic.

“He says he has James More my father’s errand,” said she. She was
whiter than ever, and her voice faltered as she said it.

“It is pretty plain now,” said I, “and may God forgive the wicked!”

She said never anything to that, but continued gazing at me with the
same white face.

“This is a fine business,” said I again. “Am I to fall, then, and those
two along with me?”

“O, what am I to do?” she cried. “Could I go against my father’s
orders, him in prison, in the danger of his life!”

“But perhaps we go too fast,” said I. “This may be a lie too. He may
have no right orders; all may be contrived by Simon, and your father
knowing nothing.”

She burst out weeping between the pair of us; and my heart smote me
hard, for I thought this girl was in a dreadful situation.

“Here,” said I, “keep him but the one hour; and I’ll chance it, and may
God bless you.”

She put out her hand to me, “I will he needing one good word,” she
sobbed.

“The full hour, then?” said I, keeping her hand in mine. “Three lives
of it, my lass!”

“The full hour!” she said, and cried aloud on her Redeemer to forgive
her.

I thought it no fit place for me, and fled.




CHAPTER XI.
THE WOOD BY SILVERMILLS


I lost no time, but down through the valley and by Stockbridge and
Silvermills as hard as I could stave. It was Alan’s tryst to be every
night between twelve and two “in a bit scrog of wood by east of
Silvermills and by south the south mill-lade.” This I found easy
enough, where it grew on a steep brae, with the mill-lade flowing swift
and deep along the foot of it; and here I began to walk slower and to
reflect more reasonably on my employment. I saw I had made but a fool’s
bargain with Catriona. It was not to be supposed that Neil was sent
alone upon his errand, but perhaps he was the only man belonging to
James More; in which case I should have done all I could to hang
Catriona’s father, and nothing the least material to help myself. To
tell the truth, I fancied neither one of these ideas. Suppose by
holding back Neil, the girl should have helped to hang her father, I
thought she would never forgive herself this side of time. And suppose
there were others pursuing me that moment, what kind of a gift was I
come bringing to Alan? and how would I like that?

I was up with the west end of that wood when these two considerations
struck me like a cudgel. My feet stopped of themselves and my heart
along with them. “What wild game is this that I have been playing?”
thought I; and turned instantly upon my heels to go elsewhere.

This brought my face to Silvermills; the path came past the village
with a crook, but all plainly visible; and, Highland or Lowland, there
was nobody stirring. Here was my advantage, here was just such a
conjuncture as Stewart had counselled me to profit by, and I ran by the
side of the mill-lade, fetched about beyond the east corner of the
wood, threaded through the midst of it, and returned to the west
selvage, whence I could again command the path, and yet be myself
unseen. Again it was all empty, and my heart began to rise.

For more than an hour I sat close in the border of the trees, and no
hare or eagle could have kept a more particular watch. When that hour
began the sun was already set, but the sky still all golden and the
daylight clear; before the hour was done it had fallen to be half mirk,
the images and distances of things were mingled, and observation began
to be difficult. All that time not a foot of man had come east from
Silvermills, and the few that had gone west were honest countryfolk and
their wives upon the road to bed. If I were tracked by the most cunning
spies in Europe, I judged it was beyond the course of nature they could
have any jealousy of where I was: and going a little further home into
the wood I lay down to wait for Alan.

The strain of my attention had been great, for I had watched not the
path only, but every bush and field within my vision. That was now at
an end. The moon, which was in her first quarter, glinted a little in
the wood; all round there was a stillness of the country; and as I lay
there on my back, the next three or four hours, I had a fine occasion
to review my conduct.

Two things became plain to me first: that I had no right to go that day
to Dean, and (having gone there) had now no right to be lying where I
was. This (where Alan was to come) was just the one wood in all broad
Scotland that was, by every proper feeling, closed against me; I
admitted that, and yet stayed on, wondering at myself. I thought of the
measure with which I had meted to Catriona that same night; how I had
prated of the two lives I carried, and had thus forced her to
enjeopardy her father’s; and how I was here exposing them again, it
seemed in wantonness. A good conscience is eight parts of courage. No
sooner had I lost conceit of my behaviour, than I seemed to stand
disarmed amidst a throng of terrors. Of a sudden I sat up. How if I
went now to Prestongrange, caught him (as I still easily might) before
he slept, and made a full submission? Who could blame me? Not Stewart
the Writer; I had but to say that I was followed, despaired of getting
clear, and so gave in. Not Catriona: here, too, I had my answer ready;
that I could not bear she should expose her father. So, in a moment, I
could lay all these troubles by, which were after all and truly none of
mine; swim clear of the Appin Murder; get forth out of hand-stroke of
all the Stewarts and Campbells, all the Whigs and Tories, in the land;
and live henceforth to my own mind, and be able to enjoy and to improve
my fortunes, and devote some hours of my youth to courting Catriona,
which would be surely a more suitable occupation than to hide and run
and be followed like a hunted thief, and begin over again the dreadful
miseries of my escape with Alan.

At first I thought no shame of this capitulation; I was only amazed I
had not thought upon the thing and done it earlier; and began to
inquire into the causes of the change. These I traced to my lowness of
spirits, that back to my late recklessness, and that again to the
common, old, public, disconsidered sin of self-indulgence. Instantly
the text came in my head, “_How can Satan cast out Satan_?” What? (I
thought) I had, by self-indulgence; and the following of pleasant
paths, and the lure of a young maid, cast myself wholly out of conceit
with my own character, and jeopardised the lives of James and Alan? And
I was to seek the way out by the same road as I had entered in? No; the
hurt that had been caused by self-indulgence must be cured by
self-denial; the flesh I had pampered must be crucified. I looked about
me for that course which I least liked to follow: this was to leave the
wood without waiting to see Alan, and go forth again alone, in the dark
and in the midst of my perplexed and dangerous fortunes.

I have been the more careful to narrate this passage of my reflections,
because I think it is of some utility, and may serve as an example to
young men. But there is reason (they say) in planting kale, and even in
ethic and religion, room for common sense. It was already close on
Alan’s hour, and the moon was down. If I left (as I could not very
decently whistle to my spies to follow me) they might miss me in the
dark and tack themselves to Alan by mistake. If I stayed, I could at
the least of it set my friend upon his guard which might prove his mere
salvation. I had adventured other peoples’ safety in a course of
self-indulgence; to have endangered them again, and now on a mere
design of penance, would have been scarce rational. Accordingly, I had
scarce risen from my place ere I sat down again, but already in a
different frame of spirits, and equally marvelling at my past weakness
and rejoicing in my present composure.

Presently after came a crackling in the thicket. Putting my mouth near
down to the ground, I whistled a note or two, of Alan’s air; an answer
came in the like guarded tone, and soon we had knocked together in the
dark.

“Is this you at last, Davie?” he whispered.

“Just myself,” said I.

“God, man, but I’ve been wearying to see ye!” says he. “I’ve had the
longest kind of a time. A’ day, I’ve had my dwelling into the inside of
a stack of hay, where I couldnae see the nebs of my ten fingers; and
then two hours of it waiting here for you, and you never coming! Dod,
and ye’re none too soon the way it is, with me to sail the morn! The
morn? what am I saying?—the day, I mean.”

“Ay, Alan, man, the day, sure enough,” said I. “It’s past twelve now,
surely, and ye sail the day. This’ll be a long road you have before
you.”

“We’ll have a long crack of it first,” said he.

“Well, indeed, and I have a good deal it will be telling you to hear,”
said I.

And I told him what behooved, making rather a jumble of it, but clear
enough when done. He heard me out with very few questions, laughing
here and there like a man delighted: and the sound of his laughing
(above all there, in the dark, where neither one of us could see the
other) was extraordinary friendly to my heart.

“Ay, Davie, ye’re a queer character,” says he, when I had done: “a
queer bitch after a’, and I have no mind of meeting with the like of
ye. As for your story, Prestongrange is a Whig like yoursel’, so I’ll
say the less of him; and, dod! I believe he was the best friend ye had,
if ye could only trust him. But Simon Fraser and James More are my ain
kind of cattle, and I’ll give them the name that they deserve. The
muckle black deil was father to the Frasers, a’body kens that; and as
for the Gregara, I never could abye the reek of them since I could
stotter on two feet. I bloodied the nose of one, I mind, when I was
still so wambly on my legs that I cowped upon the top of him. A proud
man was my father that day, God rest him! and I think he had the cause.
I’ll never can deny but what Robin was something of a piper,” he added;
“but as for James More, the deil guide him for me!”

“One thing we have to consider,” said I. “Was Charles Stewart right or
wrong? Is it only me they’re after, or the pair of us?”

“And what’s your ain opinion, you that’s a man of so much experience?”
said he.

“It passes me,” said I.

“And me too,” says Alan. “Do ye think this lass would keep her word to
ye?” he asked.

“I do that,” said I.

“Well, there’s nae telling,” said he. “And anyway, that’s over and
done: he’ll be joined to the rest of them lang syne.”

“How many would ye think there would be of them?” I asked.

“That depends,” said Alan. “If it was only you, they would likely send
two-three lively, brisk young birkies, and if they thought that I was
to appear in the employ, I daresay ten or twelve,” said he.

It was no use, I gave a little crack of laughter.

“And I think your own two eyes will have seen me drive that number, or
the double of it, nearer hand!” cries he.

“It matters the less,” said I, “because I am well rid of them for this
time.”

“Nae doubt that’s your opinion,” said he; “but I wouldnae be the least
surprised if they were hunkering this wood. Ye see, David man; they’ll
be Hieland folk. There’ll be some Frasers, I’m thinking, and some of
the Gregara; and I would never deny but what the both of them, and the
Gregara in especial, were clever experienced persons. A man kens little
till he’s driven a spreagh of neat cattle (say) ten miles through a
throng lowland country and the black soldiers maybe at his tail. It’s
there that I learned a great part of my penetration. And ye need nae
tell me: it’s better than war; which is the next best, however, though
generally rather a bauchle of a business. Now the Gregara have had
grand practice.”

“No doubt that’s a branch of education that was left out with me,” said
I.

“And I can see the marks of it upon ye constantly,” said Alan. “But
that’s the strange thing about you folk of the college learning: ye’re
ignorat, and ye cannae see ’t. Wae’s me for my Greek and Hebrew; but,
man, I ken that I dinnae ken them—there’s the differ of it. Now, here’s
you. Ye lie on your wame a bittie in the bield of this wood, and ye
tell me that ye’ve cuist off these Frasers and Macgregors. Why?
_Because I couldnae see them_, says you. Ye blockhead, that’s their
livelihood.”

“Take the worst of it,” said I, “and what are we to do?”

“I am thinking of that same,” said he. “We might twine. It wouldnae be
greatly to my taste; and forbye that, I see reasons against it. First,
it’s now unco dark, and it’s just humanly possible we might give them
the clean slip. If we keep together, we make but the ae line of it; if
we gang separate, we make twae of them: the more likelihood to stave in
upon some of these gentry of yours. And then, second, if they keep the
track of us, it may come to a fecht for it yet, Davie; and then, I’ll
confess I would be blythe to have you at my oxter, and I think you
would be none the worse of having me at yours. So, by my way of it, we
should creep out of this wood no further gone than just the inside of
next minute, and hold away east for Gillane, where I’m to find my ship.
It’ll be like old days while it lasts, Davie; and (come the time) we’ll
have to think what you should be doing. I’m wae to leave ye here,
wanting me.”

“Have with ye, then!” says I. “Do ye gang back where you were
stopping?”

“Deil a fear!” said Alan. “They were good folks to me, but I think they
would be a good deal disappointed if they saw my bonny face again. For
(the way times go) I am nae just what ye could call a Walcome Guest.
Which makes me the keener for your company, Mr. David Balfour of the
Shaws, and set ye up! For, leave aside twa cracks here in the wood with
Charlie Stewart, I have scarce said black or white since the day we
parted at Corstorphine.”

With which he rose from his place, and we began to move quietly
eastward through the wood.




CHAPTER XII.
ON THE MARCH AGAIN WITH ALAN


It was likely between one and two; the moon (as I have said) was down;
a strongish wind, carrying a heavy wrack of cloud, had set in suddenly
from the west; and we began our movement in as black a night as ever a
fugitive or a murderer wanted. The whiteness of the path guided us into
the sleeping town of Broughton, thence through Picardy, and beside my
old acquaintance the gibbet of the two thieves. A little beyond we made
a useful beacon, which was a light in an upper window of Lochend.
Steering by this, but a good deal at random, and with some trampling of
the harvest, and stumbling and falling down upon the banks, we made our
way across country, and won forth at last upon the linky, boggy
muirland that they call the Figgate Whins. Here, under a bush of whin,
we lay down the remainder of that night and slumbered.

The day called us about five. A beautiful morning it was, the high
westerly wind still blowing strong, but the clouds all blown away to
Europe. Alan was already sitting up and smiling to himself. It was my
first sight of my friend since we were parted, and I looked upon him
with enjoyment. He had still the same big great-coat on his back; but
(what was new) he had now a pair of knitted boot-hose drawn above the
knee. Doubtless these were intended for disguise; but, as the day
promised to be warm, he made a most unseasonable figure.

“Well, Davie,” said he, “is this no a bonny morning? Here is a day that
looks the way that a day ought to. This is a great change of it from
the belly of my haystack; and while you were there sottering and
sleeping I have done a thing that maybe I do very seldom.”

“And what was that?” said I.

“O, just said my prayers,” said he.

“And where are my gentry, as ye call them?” I asked.

“Gude kens,” says he; “and the short and the long of it is that we must
take our chance of them. Up with your foot-soles, Davie! Forth,
Fortune, once again of it! And a bonny walk we are like to have.”

So we went east by the beach of the sea, towards where the salt-pans
were smoking in by the Esk mouth. No doubt there was a by-ordinary
bonny blink of morning sun on Arthur’s Seat and the green Pentlands;
and the pleasantness of the day appeared to set Alan among nettles.

“I feel like a gomeral,” says he, “to be leaving Scotland on a day like
this. It sticks in my head; I would maybe like it better to stay here
and hing.”

“Ay, but ye wouldnae, Alan,” said I.

“No, but what France is a good place too,” he explained; “but it’s some
way no the same. It’s brawer I believe, but it’s no Scotland. I like it
fine when I’m there, man; yet I kind of weary for Scots divots and the
Scots peat-reek.”

“If that’s all you have to complain of, Alan, it’s no such great
affair,” said I.

“And it sets me ill to be complaining, whatever,” said he, “and me but
new out of yon deil’s haystack.”

“And so you were unco weary of your haystack?” I asked.

“Weary’s nae word for it,” said he. “I’m not just precisely a man
that’s easily cast down; but I do better with caller air and the lift
above my head. I’m like the auld Black Douglas (wasnae’t?) that likit
better to hear the laverock sing than the mouse cheep. And yon place,
ye see, Davie—whilk was a very suitable place to hide in, as I’m free
to own—was pit mirk from dawn to gloaming. There were days (or nights,
for how would I tell one from other?) that seemed to me as long as a
long winter.”

“How did you know the hour to bide your tryst?” I asked.

“The goodman brought me my meat and a drop brandy, and a candle-dowp to
eat it by, about eleeven,” said he. “So, when I had swallowed a bit, it
would he time to be getting to the wood. There I lay and wearied for ye
sore, Davie,” says he, laying his hand on my shoulder “and guessed when
the two hours would be about by—unless Charlie Stewart would come and
tell me on his watch—and then back to the dooms haystack. Na, it was a
driech employ, and praise the Lord that I have warstled through with
it!”

“What did you do with yourself?” I asked.

“Faith,” said he, “the best I could! Whiles I played at the
knucklebones. I’m an extraordinar good hand at the knucklebones, but
it’s a poor piece of business playing with naebody to admire ye. And
whiles I would make songs.”

“What were they about?” says I.

“O, about the deer and the heather,” says he, “and about the ancient
old chiefs that are all by with it lang syne, and just about what songs
are about in general. And then whiles I would make believe I had a set
of pipes and I was playing. I played some grand springs, and I thought
I played them awful bonny; I vow whiles that I could hear the squeal of
them! But the great affair is that it’s done with.”

With that he carried me again to my adventures, which he heard all over
again with more particularity, and extraordinary approval, swearing at
intervals that I was “a queer character of a callant.”

“So ye were frich’ened of Sim Fraser?” he asked once.

“In troth was I!” cried I.

“So would I have been, Davie,” said he. “And that is indeed a driedful
man. But it is only proper to give the deil his due: and I can tell you
he is a most respectable person on the field of war.”

“Is he so brave?” I asked.

“Brave!” said he. “He is as brave as my steel sword.”

The story of my duel set him beside himself.

“To think of that!” he cried. “I showed ye the trick in Corrynakiegh
too. And three times—three times disarmed! It’s a disgrace upon my
character that learned ye! Here, stand up, out with your airn; ye shall
walk no step beyond this place upon the road till ye can do yoursel’
and me mair credit.”

“Alan,” said I, “this is midsummer madness. Here is no time for fencing
lessons.”

“I cannae well say no to that,” he admitted. “But three times, man! And
you standing there like a straw bogle and rinning to fetch your ain
sword like a doggie with a pocket-napkin! David, this man Duncansby
must be something altogether by-ordinar! He maun be extraordinar
skilly. If I had the time, I would gang straight back and try a turn at
him mysel’. The man must be a provost.”

“You silly fellow,” said I, “you forget it was just me.”

“Na,” said he, “but three times!”

“When ye ken yourself that I am fair incompetent,” I cried.

“Well, I never heard tell the equal of it,” said he.

“I promise you the one thing, Alan,” said I. “The next time that we
forgather, I’ll be better learned. You shall not continue to bear the
disgrace of a friend that cannot strike.”

“Ay, the next time!” says he. “And when will that be, I would like to
ken?”

“Well, Alan, I have had some thoughts of that, too,” said I; “and my
plan is this. It’s my opinion to be called an advocate.”

“That’s but a weary trade, Davie,” says Alan, “and rather a blagyard
one forby. Ye would be better in a king’s coat than that.”

“And no doubt that would be the way to have us meet,” cried I. “But as
you’ll be in King Lewie’s coat, and I’ll be in King Geordie’s, we’ll
have a dainty meeting of it.”

“There’s some sense in that,” he admitted.

“An advocate, then, it’ll have to be,” I continued, “and I think it a
more suitable trade for a gentleman that was _three times_ disarmed.
But the beauty of the thing is this: that one of the best colleges for
that kind of learning—and the one where my kinsman, Pilrig, made his
studies—is the college of Leyden in Holland. Now, what say you, Alan?
Could not a cadet of _Royal Ecossais_ get a furlough, slip over the
marches, and call in upon a Leyden student?”

“Well, and I would think he could!” cried he. “Ye see, I stand well in
with my colonel, Count Drummond-Melfort; and, what’s mair to the
purpose I have a cousin of mine lieutenant-colonel in a regiment of the
Scots-Dutch. Naething could be mair proper than what I would get a
leave to see Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart of Halkett’s. And Lord Melfort,
who is a very scienteefic kind of a man, and writes books like Cæsar,
would be doubtless very pleased to have the advantage of my observes.”

“Is Lord Meloort an author, then?” I asked, for much as Alan thought of
soldiers, I thought more of the gentry that write books.

“The very same, Davie,” said he. “One would think a colonel would have
something better to attend to. But what can I say that make songs?”

“Well, then,” said I, “it only remains you should give me an address to
write you at in France; and as soon as I am got to Leyden I will send
you mine.”

“The best will be to write me in the care of my chieftain,” said he,
“Charles Stewart, of Ardsheil, Esquire, at the town of Melons, in the
Isle of France. It might take long, or it might take short, but it
would aye get to my hands at the last of it.”

We had a haddock to our breakfast in Musselburgh, where it amused me
vastly to hear Alan. His great-coat and boot-hose were extremely
remarkable this warm morning, and perhaps some hint of an explanation
had been wise; but Alan went into that matter like a business, or I
should rather say, like a diversion. He engaged the goodwife of the
house with some compliments upon the rizzoring of our haddocks; and the
whole of the rest of our stay held her in talk about a cold he had
taken on his stomach, gravely relating all manner of symptoms and
sufferings, and hearing with a vast show of interest all the old wives’
remedies she could supply him with in return.

We left Musselburgh before the first ninepenny coach was due from
Edinburgh for (as Alan said) that was a rencounter we might very well
avoid. The wind although still high, was very mild, the sun shone
strong, and Alan began to suffer in proportion. From Prestonpans he had
me aside to the field of Gladsmuir, where he exerted himself a great
deal more than needful to describe the stages of the battle. Thence, at
his old round pace, we travelled to Cockenzie. Though they were
building herring-busses there at Mrs. Cadell’s, it seemed a
desert-like, back-going town, about half full of ruined houses; but the
ale-house was clean, and Alan, who was now in a glowing heat, must
indulge himself with a bottle of ale, and carry on to the new luckie
with the old story of the cold upon his stomach, only now the symptoms
were all different.

I sat listening; and it came in my mind that I had scarce ever heard
him address three serious words to any woman, but he was always
drolling and fleering and making a private mock of them, and yet
brought to that business a remarkable degree of energy and interest.
Something to this effect I remarked to him, when the good-wife (as
chanced) was called away.

“What do ye want?” says he. “A man should aye put his best foot forrit
with the womankind; he should aye give them a bit of a story to divert
them, the poor lambs! It’s what ye should learn to attend to, David; ye
should get the principles, it’s like a trade. Now, if this had been a
young lassie, or onyways bonnie, she would never have heard tell of my
stomach, Davie. But aince they’re too old to be seeking joes, they a’
set up to be apotecaries. Why? What do I ken? They’ll be just the way
God made them, I suppose. But I think a man would be a gomeral that
didnae give his attention to the same.”

And here, the luckie coming back, he turned from me as if with
impatience to renew their former conversation. The lady had branched
some while before from Alan’s stomach to the case of a goodbrother of
her own in Aberlady, whose last sickness and demise she was describing
at extraordinary length. Sometimes it was merely dull, sometimes both
dull and awful, for she talked with unction. The upshot was that I fell
in a deep muse, looking forth of the window on the road, and scarce
marking what I saw. Presently had any been looking they might have seen
me to start.

“We pit a fomentation to his feet,” the good-wife was saying, “and a
het stane to his wame, and we gied him hyssop and water of pennyroyal,
and fine, clean balsam of sulphur for the hoast. . . ”

“Sir,” says I, cutting very quietly in, “there’s a friend of mine gone
by the house.”

“Is that e’en sae?” replies Alan, as though it were a thing of small
account. And then, “Ye were saying, mem?” says he; and the wearyful
wife went on.

Presently, however, he paid her with a half-crown piece, and she must
go forth after the change.

“Was it him with the red head?” asked Alan.

“Ye have it,” said I.

“What did I tell you in the wood?” he cried. “And yet it’s strange he
should be here too! Was he his lane?”

“His lee-lane for what I could see,” said I.

“Did he gang by?” he asked.

“Straight by,” said I, “and looked neither to the right nor left.”

“And that’s queerer yet,” said Alan. “It sticks in my mind, Davie, that
we should be stirring. But where to?—deil hae’t! This is like old days
fairly,” cries he.

“There is one big differ, though,” said I, “that now we have money in
our pockets.”

“And another big differ, Mr. Balfour,” says he, “that now we have dogs
at our tail. They’re on the scent; they’re in full cry, David. It’s a
bad business and be damned to it.” And he sat thinking hard with a look
of his that I knew well.

“I’m saying, Luckie,” says he, when the goodwife returned, “have ye a
back road out of this change house?”

She told him there was and where it led to.

“Then, sir,” says he to me, “I think that will be the shortest road for
us. And here’s good-bye to ye, my braw woman; and I’ll no forget thon
of the cinnamon water.”

We went out by way of the woman’s kale yard, and up a lane among
fields. Alan looked sharply to all sides, and seeing we were in a
little hollow place of the country, out of view of men, sat down.

“Now for a council of war, Davie,” said he. “But first of all, a bit
lesson to ye. Suppose that I had been like you, what would yon old wife
have minded of the pair of us! Just that we had gone out by the back
gate. And what does she mind now? A fine, canty, friendly, cracky man,
that suffered with the stomach, poor body! and was real ta’en up about
the goodbrother. O man, David, try and learn to have some kind of
intelligence!”

“I’ll try, Alan,” said I.

“And now for him of the red head,” says he; “was he gaun fast or slow?”

“Betwixt and between,” said I.

“No kind of a hurry about the man?” he asked.

“Never a sign of it,” said I.

“Nhm!” said Alan, “it looks queer. We saw nothing of them this morning
on the Whins; he’s passed us by, he doesnae seem to be looking, and yet
here he is on our road! Dod, Davie, I begin to take a notion. I think
it’s no you they’re seeking, I think it’s me; and I think they ken fine
where they’re gaun.”

“They ken?” I asked.

“I think Andie Scougal’s sold me—him or his mate wha kent some part of
the affair—or else Charlie’s clerk callant, which would be a pity too,”
says Alan; “and if you askit me for just my inward private conviction,
I think there’ll be heads cracked on Gillane sands.”

“Alan,” I cried, “if you’re at all right there’ll be folk there and to
spare. It’ll be small service to crack heads.”

“It would aye be a satisfaction though,” says Alan. “But bide a bit;
bide a bit; I’m thinking—and thanks to this bonny westland wind, I
believe I’ve still a chance of it. It’s this way, Davie. I’m no trysted
with this man Scougal till the gloaming comes. _But_,” says he, “_if I
can get a bit of a wind out of the west I’ll be there long or that_,”
he says, “_and lie-to for ye behind the Isle of Fidra_. Now if your
gentry kens the place, they ken the time forbye. Do ye see me coming,
Davie? Thanks to Johnnie Cope and other red-coat gomerals, I should ken
this country like the back of my hand; and if ye’re ready for another
bit run with Alan Breck, we’ll can cast back inshore, and come to the
seaside again by Dirleton. If the ship’s there, we’ll try and get on
board of her. If she’s no there, I’ll just have to get back to my weary
haystack. But either way of it, I think we will leave your gentry
whistling on their thumbs.”

“I believe there’s some chance in it,” said I. “Have on with ye, Alan!”




CHAPTER XIII.
GILLANE SANDS


I did not profit by Alan’s pilotage as he had done by his marchings
under General Cope; for I can scarce tell what way we went. It is my
excuse that we travelled exceeding fast. Some part we ran, some
trotted, and the rest walked at a vengeance of a pace. Twice, while we
were at top speed, we ran against country-folk; but though we plumped
into the first from round a corner, Alan was as ready as a loaded
musket.

“Has ye seen my horse?” he gasped.

“Na, man, I haenae seen nae horse the day,” replied the countryman.

And Alan spared the time to explain to him that we were travelling
“ride and tie”; that our charger had escaped, and it was feared he had
gone home to Linton. Not only that, but he expended some breath (of
which he had not very much left) to curse his own misfortune and my
stupidity which was said to be its cause.

“Them that cannae tell the truth,” he observed to myself as we went on
again, “should be aye mindful to leave an honest, handy lee behind
them. If folk dinnae ken what ye’re doing, Davie, they’re terrible
taken up with it; but if they think they ken, they care nae mair for it
than what I do for pease porridge.”

As we had first made inland, so our road came in the end to lie very
near due north; the old Kirk of Aberlady for a landmark on the left; on
the right, the top of the Berwick Law; and it was thus we struck the
shore again, not far from Dirleton. From north Berwick west to Gillane
Ness there runs a string of four small islets, Craiglieth, the Lamb,
Fidra, and Eyebrough, notable by their diversity of size and shape.
Fidra is the most particular, being a strange grey islet of two humps,
made the more conspicuous by a piece of ruin; and I mind that (as we
drew closer to it) by some door or window of these ruins the sea peeped
through like a man’s eye. Under the lee of Fidra there is a good
anchorage in westerly winds, and there, from a far way off, we could
see the _Thistle_ riding.

The shore in face of these islets is altogether waste. Here is no
dwelling of man, and scarce any passage, or at most of vagabond
children running at their play. Gillane is a small place on the far
side of the Ness, the folk of Dirleton go to their business in the
inland fields, and those of North Berwick straight to the sea-fishing
from their haven; so that few parts of the coast are lonelier. But I
mind, as we crawled upon our bellies into that multiplicity of heights
and hollows, keeping a bright eye upon all sides, and our hearts
hammering at our ribs, there was such a shining of the sun and the sea,
such a stir of the wind in the bent grass, and such a bustle of
down-popping rabbits and up-flying gulls, that the desert seemed to me,
like a place alive. No doubt it was in all ways well chosen for a
secret embarcation, if the secret had been kept; and even now that it
was out, and the place watched, we were able to creep unperceived to
the front of the sandhills, where they look down immediately on the
beach and sea.

But here Alan came to a full stop.

“Davie,” said he, “this is a kittle passage! As long as we lie here
we’re safe; but I’m nane sae muckle nearer to my ship or the coast of
France. And as soon as we stand up and signal the brig, it’s another
matter. For where will your gentry be, think ye?”

“Maybe they’re no come yet,” said I. “And even if they are, there’s one
clear matter in our favour. They’ll be all arranged to take us, that’s
true. But they’ll have arranged for our coming from the east and here
we are upon their west.”

“Ay,” says Alan, “I wish we were in some force, and this was a battle,
we would have bonnily out-manœuvred them! But it isnae, Davit; and the
way it is, is a wee thing less inspiring to Alan Breck. I swither,
Davie.”

“Time flies, Alan,” said I.

“I ken that,” said Alan. “I ken naething else, as the French folk say.
But this is a dreidful case of heids or tails. O! if I could but ken
where your gentry were!”

“Alan,” said I, “this is no like you. It’s got to be now or never.”

“This is no me, quo’ he,”


sang Alan, with a queer face betwixt shame and drollery.

“Neither you nor me, quo’ he, neither you nor me.
Wow, na, Johnnie man! neither you nor me.”


And then of a sudden he stood straight up where he was, and with a
handkerchief flying in his right hand, marched down upon the beach. I
stood up myself, but lingered behind him, scanning the sand-hills to
the east. His appearance was at first unremarked: Scougal not expecting
him so early, and _my gentry_ watching on the other side. Then they
awoke on board the _Thistle_, and it seemed they had all in readiness,
for there was scarce a second’s bustle on the deck before we saw a
skiff put round her stern and begin to pull lively for the coast.
Almost at the same moment of time, and perhaps half a mile away towards
Gillane Ness, the figure of a man appeared for a blink upon a sandhill,
waving with his arms; and though he was gone again in the same flash,
the gulls in that part continued a little longer to fly wild.

Alan had not seen this, looking straight to seaward at the ship and
skiff.

“It maun be as it will!” said he, when I had told him, “Weel may yon
boatie row, or my craig’ll have to thole a raxing.”

That part of the beach was long and flat, and excellent walking when
the tide was down; a little cressy burn flowed over it in one place to
the sea; and the sandhills ran along the head of it like the rampart of
a town. No eye of ours could spy what was passing behind there in the
bents, no hurry of ours could mend the speed of the boat’s coming: time
stood still with us through that uncanny period of waiting.

“There is one thing I would like to ken,” say Alan. “I would like to
ken these gentry’s orders. We’re worth four hunner pound the pair of
us: how if they took the guns to us, Davie! They would get a bonny shot
from the top of that lang sandy bank.”

“Morally impossible,” said I. “The point is that they can have no guns.
This thing has been gone about too secret; pistols they may have, but
never guns.”

“I believe ye’ll be in the right,” says Alan. “For all which I am
wearing a good deal for yon boat.”

And he snapped his fingers and whistled to it like a dog.

It was now perhaps a third of the way in, and we ourselves already hard
on the margin of the sea, so that the soft sand rose over my shoes.
There was no more to do whatever but to wait, to look as much as we
were able at the creeping nearer of the boat, and as little as we could
manage at the long impenetrable front of the sandhills, over which the
gulls twinkled and behind which our enemies were doubtless marshalling.

“This is a fine, bright, caller place to get shot in,” says Alan
suddenly; “and, man, I wish that I had your courage!”

“Alan!” I cried, “what kind of talk is this of it! You’re just made of
courage; it’s the character of the man, as I could prove myself if
there was nobody else.”

“And you would be the more mistaken,” said he. “What makes the differ
with me is just my great penetration and knowledge of affairs. But for
auld, cauld, dour, deadly courage, I am not fit to hold a candle to
yourself. Look at us two here upon the sands. Here am I, fair hotching
to be off; here’s you (for all that I ken) in two minds of it whether
you’ll no stop. Do you think that I could do that, or would? No me!
Firstly, because I havenae got the courage and wouldnae daur; and
secondly, because I am a man of so much penetration and would see ye
damned first.”

“It’s there ye’re coming, is it?” I cried. “Ah, man Alan, you can wile
your old wives, but you never can wile me.”

Remembrance of my temptation in the wood made me strong as iron.

“I have a tryst to keep,” I continued. “I am trysted with your cousin
Charlie; I have passed my word.”

“Braw trysts that you’ll can keep,” said Alan. “Ye’ll just mistryst
aince and for a’ with the gentry in the bents. And what for?” he went
on with an extreme threatening gravity. “Just tell me that, my mannie!
Are ye to be speerited away like Lady Grange? Are they to drive a dirk
in your inside and bury ye in the bents? Or is it to be the other way,
and are they to bring ye in with James? Are they folk to be trustit?
Would ye stick your head in the mouth of Sim Fraser and the ither
Whigs?” he added with extraordinary bitterness.

“Alan,” cried I, “they’re all rogues and liars, and I’m with ye there.
The more reason there should be one decent man in such a land of
thieves! My word is passed, and I’ll stick to it. I said long syne to
your kinswoman that I would stumble at no risk. Do ye mind of that?—the
night Red Colin fell, it was. No more I will, then. Here I stop.
Prestongrange promised me my life: if he’s to be mansworn, here I’ll
have to die.”

“Aweel aweel,” said Alan.

All this time we had seen or heard no more of our pursuers. In truth we
had caught them unawares; their whole party (as I was to learn
afterwards) had not yet reached the scene; what there was of them was
spread among the bents towards Gillane. It was quite an affair to call
them in and bring them over, and the boat was making speed. They were
besides but cowardly fellows: a mere leash of Highland cattle-thieves,
of several clans, no gentleman there to be the captain and the more
they looked at Alan and me upon the beach, the less (I must suppose)
they liked the look of us.

Whoever had betrayed Alan it was not the captain: he was in the skiff
himself, steering and stirring up his oarsmen, like a man with his
heart in his employ. Already he was near in, and the boat
securing—already Alan’s face had flamed crimson with the excitement of
his deliverance, when our friends in the bents, either in their despair
to see their prey escape them or with some hope of scaring Andie,
raised suddenly a shrill cry of several voices.

This sound, arising from what appeared to be a quite deserted coast,
was really very daunting, and the men in the boat held water instantly.

“What’s this of it?” sings out the captain, for he was come within an
easy hail.

“Freens o’mine,” says Alan, and began immediately to wade forth in the
shallow water towards the boat. “Davie,” he said, pausing, “Davie, are
ye no coming? I am swier to leave ye.”

“Not a hair of me,” said I.

“He stood part of a second where he was to his knees in the salt water,
hesitating.

“He that will to Cupar, maun to Cupar,” said he, and swashing in deeper
than his waist, was hauled into the skiff, which was immediately
directed for the ship.

I stood where he had left me, with my hands behind my back; Alan sat
with his head turned watching me; and the boat drew smoothly away. Of a
sudden I came the nearest hand to shedding tears, and seemed to myself
the most deserted solitary lad in Scotland. With that I turned my back
upon the sea and faced the sandhills. There was no sight or sound of
man; the sun shone on the wet sand and the dry, the wind blew in the
bents, the gulls made a dreary piping. As I passed higher up the beach,
the sand-lice were hopping nimbly about the stranded tangles. The devil
any other sight or sound in that unchancy place. And yet I knew there
were folk there, observing me, upon some secret purpose. They were no
soldiers, or they would have fallen on and taken us ere now; doubtless
they were some common rogues hired for my undoing, perhaps to kidnap,
perhaps to murder me outright. From the position of those engaged, the
first was the more likely; from what I knew of their character and
ardency in this business, I thought the second very possible; and the
blood ran cold about my heart.

I had a mad idea to loosen my sword in the scabbard; for though I was
very unfit to stand up like a gentleman blade to blade, I thought I
could do some scathe in a random combat. But I perceived in time the
folly of resistance. This was no doubt the joint “expedient” on which
Prestongrange and Fraser were agreed. The first, I was very sure, had
done something to secure my life; the second was pretty likely to have
slipped in some contrary hints into the ears of Neil and his
companions; and if I were to show bare steel I might play straight into
the hands of my worst enemy and seal my own doom.

These thoughts brought me to the head of the beach. I cast a look
behind, the boat was nearing the brig, and Alan flew his handkerchief
for a farewell, which I replied to with the waving of my hand. But Alan
himself was shrunk to a small thing in my view, alongside of this pass
that lay in front of me. I set my hat hard on my head, clenched my
teeth, and went right before me up the face of the sand-wreath. It made
a hard climb, being steep, and the sand like water underfoot. But I
caught hold at last by the long bent-grass on the brae-top, and pulled
myself to a good footing. The same moment men stirred and stood up here
and there, six or seven of them, ragged-like knaves, each with a dagger
in his hand. The fair truth is, I shut my eyes and prayed. When I
opened them again, the rogues were crept the least thing nearer without
speech or hurry. Every eye was upon mine, which struck me with a
strange sensation of their brightness, and of the fear with which they
continued to approach me. I held out my hands empty; whereupon one
asked, with a strong Highland brogue, if I surrendered.

“Under protest,” said I, “if ye ken what that means, which I misdoubt.”

At that word, they came all in upon me like a flight of birds upon a
carrion, seized me, took my sword, and all the money from my pockets,
bound me hand and foot with some strong line, and cast me on a tussock
of bent. There they sat about their captive in a part of a circle and
gazed upon him silently like something dangerous, perhaps a lion or a
tiger on the spring. Presently this attention was relaxed. They drew
nearer together, fell to speech in the Gaelic, and very cynically
divided my property before my eyes. It was my diversion in this time
that I could watch from my place the progress of my friend’s escape. I
saw the boat come to the brig and be hoisted in, the sails fill, and
the ship pass out seaward behind the isles and by North Berwick.

In the course of two hours or so, more and more ragged Highlandmen kept
collecting. Neil among the first, until the party must have numbered
near a score. With each new arrival there was a fresh bout of talk,
that sounded like complaints and explanations; but I observed one
thing, none of those who came late had any share in the division of my
spoils. The last discussion was very violent and eager, so that once I
thought they would have quarrelled; on the heels of which their company
parted, the bulk of them returning westward in a troop, and only three,
Neil and two others, remaining sentries on the prisoner.

“I could name one who would be very ill pleased with your day’s work,
Neil Duncanson,” said I, when the rest had moved away.

He assured me in answer I should be tenderly used, for he knew he was
“acquent wi’ the leddy.”

This was all our talk, nor did any other son of man appear upon that
portion of the coast until the sun had gone down among the Highland
mountains, and the gloaming was beginning to grow dark. At which hour I
was aware of a long, lean, bony-like Lothian man of a very swarthy
countenance, that came towards us among the bents on a farm horse.

“Lads,” cried he, “has ye a paper like this?” and held up one in his
hand. Neil produced a second, which the newcomer studied through a pair
of horn spectacles, and saying all was right and we were the folk he
was seeking, immediately dismounted. I was then set in his place, my
feet tied under the horse’s belly, and we set forth under the guidance
of the Lowlander. His path must have been very well chosen, for we met
but one pair—a pair of lovers—the whole way, and these, perhaps taking
us to be free-traders, fled on our approach. We were at one time close
at the foot of Berwick Law on the south side; at another, as we passed
over some open hills, I spied the lights of a clachan and the old tower
of a church among some trees not far off, but too far to cry for help,
if I had dreamed of it. At last we came again within sound of the sea.
There was moonlight, though not much; and by this I could see the three
huge towers and broken battlements of Tantallon, that old chief place
of the Red Douglases. The horse was picketed in the bottom of the ditch
to graze, and I was led within, and forth into the court, and thence
into the tumble-down stone hall. Here my conductors built a brisk fire
in the midst of the pavement, for there was a chill in the night. My
hands were loosed, I was set by the wall in the inner end, and (the
Lowlander having produced provisions) I was given oatmeal bread and a
pitcher of French brandy. This done, I was left once more alone with my
three Highlandmen. They sat close by the fire drinking and talking; the
wind blew in by the breaches, cast about the smoke and flames, and sang
in the tops of the towers; I could hear the sea under the cliffs, and,
my mind being reassured as to my life, and my body and spirits wearied
with the day’s employment, I turned upon one side and slumbered.

I had no means of guessing at what hour I was wakened, only the moon
was down and the fire was low. My feet were now loosed, and I was
carried through the ruins and down the cliff-side by a precipitous path
to where I found a fisher’s boat in a haven of the rocks. This I was
had on board of, and we began to put forth from the shore in a fine
starlight.




CHAPTER XIV.
THE BASS


I had no thought where they were taking me; only looked here and there
for the appearance of a ship; and there ran the while in my head a word
of Ransome’s—the_ twenty-pounders_. If I were to be exposed a second
time to that same former danger of the plantations, I judged it must
turn ill with me; there was no second Alan; and no second shipwreck and
spare yard to be expected now; and I saw myself hoe tobacco under the
whip’s lash. The thought chilled me; the air was sharp upon the water,
the stretchers of the boat drenched with a cold dew: and I shivered in
my place beside the steersman. This was the dark man whom I have called
hitherto the Lowlander; his name was Dale, ordinarily called Black
Andie. Feeling the thrill of my shiver, he very kindly handed me a
rough jacket full of fish-scales, with which I was glad to cover
myself.

“I thank you for this kindness,” said I, “and will make so free as to
repay it with a warning. You take a high responsibility in this affair.
You are not like these ignorant, barbarous Highlanders, but know what
the law is and the risks of those that break it.”

“I am no just exactly what ye would ca’ an extremist for the law,” says
he, “at the best of times; but in this business I act with a good
warranty.”

“What are you going to do with me?” I asked.

“Nae harm,” said he, “nae harm ava’. Ye’ll have strong freens, I’m
thinking. Ye’ll be richt eneuch yet.”

There began to fall a greyness on the face of the sea; little dabs of
pink and red, like coals of slow fire, came in the east; and at the
same time the geese awakened, and began crying about the top of the
Bass. It is just the one crag of rock, as everybody knows, but great
enough to carve a city from. The sea was extremely little, but there
went a hollow plowter round the base of it. With the growing of the
dawn I could see it clearer and clearer; the straight crags painted
with sea-birds’ droppings like a morning frost, the sloping top of it
green with grass, the clan of white geese that cried about the sides,
and the black, broken buildings of the prison sitting close on the
sea’s edge.

At the sight the truth came in upon me in a clap.

“It’s there you’re taking me!” I cried.

“Just to the Bass, mannie,” said he: “Whaur the auld saints were afore
ye, and I misdoubt if ye have come so fairly by your preeson.”

“But none dwells there now,” I cried; “the place is long a ruin.”

“It’ll be the mair pleisand a change for the solan geese, then,” quoth
Andie dryly.

The day coming slowly brighter I observed on the bilge, among the big
stones with which fisherfolk ballast their boats, several kegs and
baskets, and a provision of fuel. All these were discharged upon the
crag. Andie, myself, and my three Highlanders (I call them mine,
although it was the other way about), landed along with them. The sun
was not yet up when the boat moved away again, the noise of the oars on
the thole-pins echoing from the cliffs, and left us in our singular
reclusion:

Andie Dale was the Prefect (as I would jocularly call him) of the Bass,
being at once the shepherd and the gamekeeper of that small and rich
estate. He had to mind the dozen or so of sheep that fed and fattened
on the grass of the sloping part of it, like beasts grazing the roof of
a cathedral. He had charge besides of the solan geese that roosted in
the crags; and from these an extraordinary income is derived. The young
are dainty eating, as much as two shillings a-piece being a common
price, and paid willingly by epicures; even the grown birds are
valuable for their oil and feathers; and a part of the minister’s
stipend of North Berwick is paid to this day in solan geese, which
makes it (in some folks’ eyes) a parish to be coveted. To perform these
several businesses, as well as to protect the geese from poachers,
Andie had frequent occasion to sleep and pass days together on the
crag; and we found the man at home there like a farmer in his steading.
Bidding us all shoulder some of the packages, a matter in which I made
haste to bear a hand, he led us in by a locked gate, which was the only
admission to the island, and through the ruins of the fortress, to the
governor’s house. There we saw by the ashes in the chimney and a
standing bed-place in one corner, that he made his usual occupation.

This bed he now offered me to use, saying he supposed I would set up to
be gentry.

“My gentrice has nothing to do with where I lie,” said I. “I bless God
I have lain hard ere now, and can do the same again with thankfulness.
While I am here, Mr. Andie, if that be your name, I will do my part and
take my place beside the rest of you; and I ask you on the other hand
to spare me your mockery, which I own I like ill.”

He grumbled a little at this speech, but seemed upon reflection to
approve it. Indeed, he was a long-headed, sensible man, and a good Whig
and Presbyterian; read daily in a pocket Bible, and was both able and
eager to converse seriously on religion, leaning more than a little
towards the Cameronian extremes. His morals were of a more doubtful
colour. I found he was deep in the free trade, and used the ruins of
Tantallon for a magazine of smuggled merchandise. As for a gauger, I do
not believe he valued the life of one at half-a-farthing. But that part
of the coast of Lothian is to this day as wild a place, and the commons
there as rough a crew, as any in Scotland.

One incident of my imprisonment is made memorable by a consequence it
had long after. There was a warship at this time stationed in the
Firth, the _Seahorse_, Captain Palliser. It chanced she was cruising in
the month of September, plying between Fife and Lothian, and sounding
for sunk dangers. Early one fine morning she was seen about two miles
to east of us, where she lowered a boat, and seemed to examine the
Wildfire Rocks and Satan’s Bush, famous dangers of that coast. And
presently after having got her boat again, she came before the wind and
was headed directly for the Bass. This was very troublesome to Andie
and the Highlanders; the whole business of my sequestration was
designed for privacy, and here, with a navy captain perhaps blundering
ashore, it looked to become public enough, if it were nothing worse. I
was in a minority of one, I am no Alan to fall upon so many, and I was
far from sure that a warship was the least likely to improve my
condition. All which considered, I gave Andie my parole of good
behaviour and obedience, and was had briskly to the summit of the rock,
where we all lay down, at the cliff’s edge, in different places of
observation and concealment. The _Seahorse_ came straight on till I
thought she would have struck, and we (looking giddily down) could see
the ship’s company at their quarters and hear the leadsman singing at
the lead. Then she suddenly wore and let fly a volley of I know not how
many great guns. The rock was shaken with the thunder of the sound, the
smoke flowed over our heads, and the geese rose in number beyond
computation or belief. To hear their screaming and to see the twinkling
of their wings, made a most inimitable curiosity; and I suppose it was
after this somewhat childish pleasure that Captain Palliser had come so
near the Bass. He was to pay dear for it in time. During his approach I
had the opportunity to make a remark upon the rigging of that ship by
which I ever after knew it miles away; and this was a means (under
Providence) of my averting from a friend a great calamity, and
inflicting on Captain Palliser himself a sensible disappointment.

All the time of my stay on the rock we lived well. We had small ale and
brandy, and oatmeal, of which we made our porridge night and morning.
At times a boat came from the Castleton and brought us a quarter of
mutton, for the sheep upon the rock we must not touch, these being
specially fed to market. The geese were unfortunately out of season,
and we let them be. We fished ourselves, and yet more often made the
geese to fish for us: observing one when he had made a capture and
scaring him from his prey ere he had swallowed it.

The strange nature of this place, and the curiosities with which it
abounded, held me busy and amused. Escape being impossible, I was
allowed my entire liberty, and continually explored the surface of the
isle wherever it might support the foot of man. The old garden of the
prison was still to be observed, with flowers and pot-herbs running
wild, and some ripe cherries on a bush. A little lower stood a chapel
or a hermit’s cell; who built or dwelt in it, none may know, and the
thought of its age made a ground of many meditations. The prison, too,
where I now bivouacked with Highland cattle-thieves, was a place full
of history, both human and divine. I thought it strange so many saints
and martyrs should have gone by there so recently, and left not so much
as a leaf out of their Bibles, or a name carved upon the wall, while
the rough soldier lads that mounted guard upon the battlements had
filled the neighbourhood with their mementoes—broken tobacco-pipes for
the most part, and that in a surprising plenty, but also metal buttons
from their coats. There were times when I thought I could have heard
the pious sound of psalms out of the martyr’s dungeons, and seen the
soldiers tramp the ramparts with their glinting pipes, and the dawn
rising behind them out of the North Sea.

No doubt it was a good deal Andie and his tales that put these fancies
in my head. He was extraordinarily well acquainted with the story of
the rock in all particulars, down to the names of private soldiers, his
father having served there in that same capacity. He was gifted besides
with a natural genius for narration, so that the people seemed to speak
and the things to be done before your face. This gift of his and my
assiduity to listen brought us the more close together. I could not
honestly deny but what I liked him; I soon saw that he liked me; and
indeed, from the first I had set myself out to capture his good-will.
An odd circumstance (to be told presently) effected this beyond my
expectation; but even in early days we made a friendly pair to be a
prisoner and his gaoler.

I should trifle with my conscience if I pretended my stay upon the Bass
was wholly disagreeable. It seemed to me a safe place, as though I was
escaped there out of my troubles. No harm was to be offered me; a
material impossibility, rock and the deep sea, prevented me from fresh
attempts; I felt I had my life safe and my honour safe, and there were
times when I allowed myself to gloat on them like stolen waters. At
other times my thoughts were very different, I recalled how strong I
had expressed myself both to Rankeillor and to Stewart; I reflected
that my captivity upon the Bass, in view of a great part of the coasts
of Fife and Lothian, was a thing I should be thought more likely to
have invented than endured; and in the eyes of these two gentlemen, at
least, I must pass for a boaster and a coward. Now I would take this
lightly enough; tell myself that so long as I stood well with Catriona
Drummond, the opinion of the rest of man was but moonshine and spilled
water; and thence pass off into those meditations of a lover which are
so delightful to himself and must always appear so surprisingly idle to
a reader. But anon the fear would take me otherwise; I would be shaken
with a perfect panic of self-esteem, and these supposed hard judgments
appear an injustice impossible to be supported. With that another train
of thought would he presented, and I had scarce begun to be concerned
about men’s judgments of myself, than I was haunted with the
remembrance of James Stewart in his dungeon and the lamentations of his
wife. Then, indeed, passion began to work in me; I could not forgive
myself to sit there idle: it seemed (if I were a man at all) that I
could fly or swim out of my place of safety; and it was in such humours
and to amuse my self-reproaches that I would set the more particularly
to win the good side of Andie Dale.

At last, when we two were alone on the summit of the rock on a bright
morning, I put in some hint about a bribe. He looked at me, cast back
his head, and laughed out loud.

“Ay, you’re funny, Mr. Dale,” said I, “but perhaps if you’ll glance an
eye upon that paper you may change your note.”

The stupid Highlanders had taken from me at the time of my seizure
nothing but hard money, and the paper I now showed Andie was an
acknowledgment from the British Linen Company for a considerable sum.

He read it. “Troth, and ye’re nane sae ill aff,” said he.

“I thought that would maybe vary your opinions,” said I.

“Hout!” said he. “It shows me ye can bribe; but I’m no to be bribit.”

“We’ll see about that yet a while,” says I. “And first, I’ll show you
that I know what I am talking. You have orders to detain me here till
after Thursday, 21st September.”

“Ye’re no a’thegether wrong either,” says Andie. “I’m to let you gang,
bar orders contrair, on Saturday, the 23rd.”

I could not but feel there was something extremely insidious in this
arrangement. That I was to re-appear precisely in time to be too late
would cast the more discredit on my tale, if I were minded to tell one;
and this screwed me to fighting point.

“Now then, Andie, you that kens the world, listen to me, and think
while ye listen,” said I. “I know there are great folks in the
business, and I make no doubt you have their names to go upon. I have
seen some of them myself since this affair began, and said my say into
their faces too. But what kind of a crime would this be that I had
committed? or what kind of a process is this that I am fallen under? To
be apprehended by some ragged John-Hielandman on August 30th, carried
to a rickle of old stones that is now neither fort nor gaol (whatever
it once was) but just the gamekeeper’s lodge of the Bass Rock, and set
free again, September 23rd, as secretly as I was first arrested—does
that sound like law to you? or does it sound like justice? or does it
not sound honestly like a piece of some low dirty intrigue, of which
the very folk that meddle with it are ashamed?”

“I canna gainsay ye, Shaws. It looks unco underhand,” says Andie. “And
werenae the folk guid sound Whigs and true-blue Presbyterians I would
has seen them ayont Jordan and Jeroozlem or I would have set hand to
it.”

“The Master of Lovat’ll be a braw Whig,” says I, “and a grand
Presbyterian.”

“I ken naething by him,” said he. “I hae nae trokings wi’ Lovats.”

“No, it’ll be Prestongrange that you’ll be dealing with,” said I.

“Ah, but I’ll no tell ye that,” said Andie.

“Little need when I ken,” was my retort.

“There’s just the ae thing ye can be fairly sure of, Shaws,” says
Andie. “And that is that (try as ye please) I’m no dealing wi’
yoursel’; nor yet I amnae goin’ to,” he added.

“Well, Andie, I see I’ll have to be speak out plain with you,” I
replied. And told him so much as I thought needful of the facts.

He heard me out with some serious interest, and when I had done, seemed
to consider a little with himself.

“Shaws,” said he at last, “I’ll deal with the naked hand. It’s a queer
tale, and no very creditable, the way you tell it; and I’m far frae
minting that is other than the way that ye believe it. As for yoursel’,
ye seem to me rather a dacent-like young man. But me, that’s aulder and
mair judeecious, see perhaps a wee bit further forrit in the job than
what ye can dae. And here the maitter clear and plain to ye. There’ll
be nae skaith to yoursel’ if I keep ye here; far free that, I think
ye’ll be a hantle better by it. There’ll be nae skaith to the
kintry—just ae mair Hielantman hangit—Gude kens, a guid riddance! On
the ither hand, it would be considerable skaith to me if I would let
you free. Sae, speakin’ as a guid Whig, an honest freen’ to you, and an
anxious freen’ to my ainsel’, the plain fact is that I think ye’ll just
have to bide here wi’ Andie an’ the solans.”

“Andie,” said I, laying my hand upon his knee, “this Hielantman’s
innocent.”

“Ay, it’s a peety about that,” said he. “But ye see, in this warld, the
way God made it, we cannae just get a’thing that we want.”




CHAPTER XV.
BLACK ANDIE’S TALE OF TOD LAPRAIK


I have yet said little of the Highlanders. They were all three of the
followers of James More, which bound the accusation very tight about
their master’s neck. All understood a word or two of English, but Neil
was the only one who judged he had enough of it for general converse,
in which (when once he got embarked) his company was often tempted to
the contrary opinion. They were tractable, simple creatures; showed
much more courtesy than might have been expected from their raggedness
and their uncouth appearance, and fell spontaneously to be like three
servants for Andie and myself.

Dwelling in that isolated place, in the old falling ruins of a prison,
and among endless strange sounds of the sea and the sea-birds, I
thought I perceived in them early the effects of superstitious fear.
When there was nothing doing they would either lie and sleep, for which
their appetite appeared insatiable, or Neil would entertain the others
with stories which seemed always of a terrifying strain. If neither of
these delights were within reach—if perhaps two were sleeping and the
third could find no means to follow their example—I would see him sit
and listen and look about him in a progression of uneasiness, starting,
his face blenching, his hands clutched, a man strung like a bow. The
nature of these fears I had never an occasion to find out, but the
sight of them was catching, and the nature of the place that we were in
favourable to alarms. I can find no word for it in the English, but
Andie had an expression for it in the Scots from which he never varied.

“Ay,” he would say, “_it’s an unco place_, _the Bass_.”

It is so I always think of it. It was an unco place by night, unco by
day; and these were unco sounds, of the calling of the solans, and the
plash of the sea and the rock echoes, that hung continually in our
ears. It was chiefly so in moderate weather. When the waves were anyway
great they roared about the rock like thunder and the drums of armies,
dreadful but merry to hear; and it was in the calm days that a man
could daunt himself with listening—not a Highlandman only, as I several
times experimented on myself, so many still, hollow noises haunted and
reverberated in the porches of the rock.

This brings me to a story I heard, and a scene I took part in, which
quite changed our terms of living, and had a great effect on my
departure. It chanced one night I fell in a muse beside the fire and
(that little air of Alan’s coming back to my memory) began to whistle.
A hand was laid upon my arm, and the voice of Neil bade me to stop, for
it was not “canny musics.”

“Not canny?” I asked. “How can that be?”

“Na,” said he; “it will be made by a bogle and her wanting ta heid upon
his body.” [13]

“Well,” said I, “there can be no bogles here, Neil; for it’s not likely
they would fash themselves to frighten geese.”

“Ay?” says Andie, “is that what ye think of it! But I’ll can tell ye
there’s been waur nor bogles here.”

“What’s waur than bogles, Andie?” said I.

“Warlocks,” said he. “Or a warlock at the least of it. And that’s a
queer tale, too,” he added. “And if ye would like, I’ll tell it ye.”

To be sure we were all of the one mind, and even the Highlander that
had the least English of the three set himself to listen with all his
might.

The Tale of Tod Lapraik

My faither, Tam Dale, peace to his banes, was a wild, sploring lad in
his young days, wi’ little wisdom and little grace. He was fond of a
lass and fond of a glass, and fond of a ran-dan; but I could never hear
tell that he was muckle use for honest employment. Frae ae thing to
anither, he listed at last for a sodger and was in the garrison of this
fort, which was the first way that ony of the Dales cam to set foot
upon the Bass. Sorrow upon that service! The governor brewed his ain
ale; it seems it was the warst conceivable. The rock was proveesioned
free the shore with vivers, the thing was ill-guided, and there were
whiles when they but to fish and shoot solans for their diet. To crown
a’, thir was the Days of the Persecution. The perishin’ cauld chalmers
were all occupeed wi’ sants and martyrs, the saut of the yearth, of
which it wasnae worthy. And though Tam Dale carried a firelock there, a
single sodger, and liked a lass and a glass, as I was sayin,’ the mind
of the man was mair just than set with his position. He had glints of
the glory of the kirk; there were whiles when his dander rase to see
the Lord’s sants misguided, and shame covered him that he should be
haulding a can’le (or carrying a firelock) in so black a business.
There were nights of it when he was here on sentry, the place a’
wheesht, the frosts o’ winter maybe riving in the wa’s, and he would
hear ane o’ the prisoners strike up a psalm, and the rest join in, and
the blessed sounds rising from the different chalmers—or dungeons, I
would raither say—so that this auld craig in the sea was like a pairt
of Heev’n. Black shame was on his saul; his sins hove up before him
muckle as the Bass, and above a’, that chief sin, that he should have a
hand in hagging and hashing at Christ’s Kirk. But the truth is that he
resisted the spirit. Day cam, there were the rousing compainions, and
his guid resolves depairtit.

In thir days, dwalled upon the Bass a man of God, Peden the Prophet was
his name. Ye’ll have heard tell of Prophet Peden. There was never the
wale of him sinsyne, and it’s a question wi’ mony if there ever was his
like afore. He was wild’s a peat-hag, fearsome to look at, fearsome to
hear, his face like the day of judgment. The voice of him was like a
solan’s and dinnle’d in folks’ lugs, and the words of him like coals of
fire.

Now there was a lass on the rock, and I think she had little to do, for
it was nae place far decent weemen; but it seems she was bonny, and her
and Tam Dale were very well agreed. It befell that Peden was in the
gairden his lane at the praying when Tam and the lass cam by; and what
should the lassie do but mock with laughter at the sant’s devotions? He
rose and lookit at the twa o’ them, and Tam’s knees knoitered thegether
at the look of him. But whan he spak, it was mair in sorrow than in
anger. “Poor thing, poor thing!” says he, and it was the lass he lookit
at, “I hear you skirl and laugh,” he says, “but the Lord has a deid
shot prepared for you, and at that surprising judgment ye shall skirl
but the ae time!” Shortly thereafter she was daundering on the craigs
wi’ twa-three sodgers, and it was a blawy day. There cam a gowst of
wind, claught her by the coats, and awa’ wi’ her bag and baggage. And
it was remarked by the sodgers that she gied but the ae skirl.

Nae doubt this judgment had some weicht upon Tam Dale; but it passed
again and him none the better. Ae day he was flyting wi’ anither
sodger-lad. “Deil hae me!” quo’ Tam, for he was a profane swearer. And
there was Peden glowering at him, gash an’ waefu’; Peden wi’ his lang
chafts an’ luntin’ een, the maud happed about his kist, and the hand of
him held out wi’ the black nails upon the finger-nebs—for he had nae
care of the body. “Fy, fy, poor man!” cries he, “the poor fool man!
_Deil hae me_, quo’ he; an’ I see the deil at his oxter.” The
conviction of guilt and grace cam in on Tam like the deep sea; he flang
doun the pike that was in his hands—“I will nae mair lift arms against
the cause o’ Christ!” says he, and was as gude’s word. There was a sair
fyke in the beginning, but the governor, seeing him resolved, gied him
his discharge, and he went and dwallt and merried in North Berwick, and
had aye a gude name with honest folk free that day on.

It was in the year seeventeen hunner and sax that the Bass cam in the
hands o’ the Da’rymples, and there was twa men soucht the chairge of
it. Baith were weel qualified, for they had baith been sodgers in the
garrison, and kent the gate to handle solans, and the seasons and
values of them. Forby that they were baith—or they baith seemed—earnest
professors and men of comely conversation. The first of them was just
Tam Dale, my faither. The second was ane Lapraik, whom the folk ca’d
Tod Lapraik maistly, but whether for his name or his nature I could
never hear tell. Weel, Tam gaed to see Lapraik upon this business, and
took me, that was a toddlin’ laddie, by the hand. Tod had his dwallin’
in the lang loan benorth the kirkyaird. It’s a dark uncanny loan, forby
that the kirk has aye had an ill name since the days o’ James the Saxt
and the deevil’s cantrips played therein when the Queen was on the
seas; and as for Tod’s house, it was in the mirkest end, and was little
liked by some that kenned the best. The door was on the sneck that day,
and me and my faither gaed straucht in. Tod was a wabster to his trade;
his loom stood in the but. There he sat, a muckle fat, white hash of a
man like creish, wi’ a kind of a holy smile that gart me scunner. The
hand of him aye cawed the shuttle, but his een was steeked. We cried to
him by his name, we skirled in the deid lug of him, we shook him by the
shou’ther. Nae mainner o’ service! There he sat on his dowp, an’ cawed
the shuttle and smiled like creish.

“God be guid to us,” says Tam Dale, “this is no canny?”

He had jimp said the word, when Tod Lapraik cam to himsel’.

“Is this you, Tam?” says he. “Haith, man! I’m blythe to see ye. I
whiles fa’ into a bit dwam like this,” he says; “its frae the stamach.”

Weel, they began to crack about the Bass and which of them twa was to
get the warding o’t, and little by little cam to very ill words, and
twined in anger. I mind weel that as my faither and me gaed hame again,
he cam ower and ower the same expression, how little he likit Tod
Lapraik and his dwams.

“Dwam!” says he. “I think folk hae brunt for dwams like yon.”

Aweel, my faither got the Bass and Tod had to go wantin’. It was
remembered sinsyne what way he had ta’en the thing. “Tam,” says he, “ye
hae gotten the better o’ me aince mair, and I hope,” says he, “ye’ll
find at least a’ that ye expeckit at the Bass.” Which have since been
thought remarkable expressions. At last the time came for Tam Dale to
take young solans. This was a business he was weel used wi’, he had
been a craigsman frae a laddie, and trustit nane but himsel’. So there
was he hingin’ by a line an’ speldering on the craig face, whaur its
hieest and steighest. Fower tenty lads were on the tap, hauldin’ the
line and mindin’ for his signals. But whaur Tam hung there was naething
but the craig, and the sea belaw, and the solans skirlin and flying. It
was a braw spring morn, and Tam whustled as he claught in the young
geese. Mony’s the time I’ve heard him tell of this experience, and aye
the swat ran upon the man.

It chanced, ye see, that Tam keeked up, and he was awaur of a muckle
solan, and the solan pyking at the line. He thocht this by-ordinar and
outside the creature’s habits. He minded that ropes was unco saft
things, and the solan’s neb and the Bass Rock unco hard, and that twa
hunner feet were raither mair than he would care to fa’.

“Shoo!” says Tam. “Awa’, bird! Shoo, awa’ wi’ ye!” says he.

The solan keekit doon into Tam’s face, and there was something unco in
the creature’s ee. Just the ae keek it gied, and back to the rope. But
now it wroucht and warstl’t like a thing dementit. There never was the
solan made that wroucht as that solan wroucht; and it seemed to
understand its employ brawly, birzing the saft rope between the neb of
it and a crunkled jag o’ stane.

There gaed a cauld stend o’ fear into Tam’s heart. “This thing is nae
bird,” thinks he. His een turnt backward in his heid and the day gaed
black aboot him. “If I get a dwam here,” he toucht, “it’s by wi’ Tam
Dale.” And he signalled for the lads to pu’ him up.

And it seemed the solan understood about signals. For nae sooner was
the signal made than he let be the rope, spried his wings, squawked out
loud, took a turn flying, and dashed straucht at Tam Dale’s een. Tam
had a knife, he gart the cauld steel glitter. And it seemed the solan
understood about knives, for nae suner did the steel glint in the sun
than he gied the ae squawk, but laighter, like a body disappointit, and
flegged aff about the roundness of the craig, and Tam saw him nae mair.
And as sune as that thing was gane, Tam’s heid drapt upon his shouther,
and they pu’d him up like a deid corp, dadding on the craig.

A dram of brandy (which he went never without) broucht him to his mind,
or what was left of it. Up he sat.

“Rin, Geordie, rin to the boat, mak’ sure of the boat, man—rin!” he
cries, “or yon solan’ll have it awa’,” says he.

The fower lads stared at ither, an’ tried to whilly-wha him to be
quiet. But naething would satisfy Tam Dale, till ane o’ them had
startit on aheid to stand sentry on the boat. The ithers askit if he
was for down again.

“Na,” says he, “and niether you nor me,” says he, “and as sune as I can
win to stand on my twa feet we’ll be aff frae this craig o’ Sawtan.”

Sure eneuch, nae time was lost, and that was ower muckle; for before
they won to North Berwick Tam was in a crying fever. He lay a’ the
simmer; and wha was sae kind as come speiring for him, but Tod Lapraik!
Folk thocht afterwards that ilka time Tod cam near the house the fever
had worsened. I kenna for that; but what I ken the best, that was the
end of it.

It was about this time o’ the year; my grandfaither was out at the
white fishing; and like a bairn, I but to gang wi’ him. We had a grand
take, I mind, and the way that the fish lay broucht us near in by the
Bass, whaur we foregaithered wi’ anither boat that belanged to a man
Sandie Fletcher in Castleton. He’s no lang deid neither, or ye could
speir at himsel’. Weel, Sandie hailed.

“What’s yon on the Bass?” says he.

“On the Bass?” says grandfaither.

“Ay,” says Sandie, “on the green side o’t.”

“Whatten kind of a thing?” says grandfaither. “There cannae be naething
on the Bass but just the sheep.”

“It looks unco like a body,” quo’ Sandie, who was nearer in.

“A body!” says we, and we none of us likit that. For there was nae boat
that could have brought a man, and the key o’ the prison yett hung ower
my faither’s at hame in the press bed.

We keept the twa boats close for company, and crap in nearer hand.
Grandfaither had a gless, for he had been a sailor, and the captain of
a smack, and had lost her on the sands of Tay. And when we took the
glass to it, sure eneuch there was a man. He was in a crunkle o’ green
brae, a wee below the chaipel, a’ by his lee lane, and lowped and flang
and danced like a daft quean at a waddin’.

“It’s Tod,” says grandfather, and passed the gless to Sandie.

“Ay, it’s him,” says Sandie.

“Or ane in the likeness o’ him,” says grandfaither.

“Sma’ is the differ,” quo’ Sandie. “De’il or warlock, I’ll try the gun
at him,” quo’ he, and broucht up a fowling-piece that he aye carried,
for Sandie was a notable famous shot in all that country.

“Haud your hand, Sandie,” says grandfaither; “we maun see clearer
first,” says he, “or this may be a dear day’s wark to the baith of us.”

“Hout!” says Sandie, “this is the Lord’s judgment surely, and be damned
to it,” says he.

“Maybe ay, and maybe no,” says my grandfaither, worthy man! “But have
you a mind of the Procurator Fiscal, that I think ye’ll have
foregaithered wi’ before,” says he.

This was ower true, and Sandie was a wee thing set ajee. “Aweel, Edie,”
says he, “and what would be your way of it?”

“Ou, just this,” says grandfaither. “Let me that has the fastest boat
gang back to North Berwick, and let you bide here and keep an eye on
Thon. If I cannae find Lapraik, I’ll join ye and the twa of us’ll have
a crack wi’ him. But if Lapraik’s at hame, I’ll rin up the flag at the
harbour, and ye can try Thon Thing wi’ the gun.”

Aweel, so it was agreed between them twa. I was just a bairn, an’ clum
in Sandie’s boat, whaur I thoucht I would see the best of the employ.
My grandsire gied Sandie a siller tester to pit in his gun wi’ the leid
draps, bein mair deidly again bogles. And then the as boat set aff for
North Berwick, an’ the tither lay whaur it was and watched the
wanchancy thing on the brae-side.

A’ the time we lay there it lowped and flang and capered and span like
a teetotum, and whiles we could hear it skelloch as it span. I hae seen
lassies, the daft queans, that would lowp and dance a winter’s nicht,
and still be lowping and dancing when the winter’s day cam in. But
there would be fowk there to hauld them company, and the lads to egg
them on; and this thing was its lee-lane. And there would be a fiddler
diddling his elbock in the chimney-side; and this thing had nae music
but the skirling of the solans. And the lassies were bits o’ young
things wi’ the reid life dinnling and stending in their members; and
this was a muckle, fat, creishy man, and him fa’n in the vale o’ years.
Say what ye like, I maun say what I believe. It was joy was in the
creature’s heart, the joy o’ hell, I daursay: joy whatever. Mony a time
I have askit mysel’ why witches and warlocks should sell their sauls
(whilk are their maist dear possessions) and be auld, duddy, wrunkl’t
wives or auld, feckless, doddered men; and then I mind upon Tod Lapraik
dancing a’ the hours by his lane in the black glory of his heart. Nae
doubt they burn for it muckle in hell, but they have a grand time here
of it, whatever!—and the Lord forgie us!

Weel, at the hinder end, we saw the wee flag yirk up to the mast-heid
upon the harbour rocks. That was a’ Sandie waited for. He up wi’ the
gun, took a deleeberate aim, an’ pu’d the trigger. There cam’ a bang
and then ae waefu’ skirl frae the Bass. And there were we rubbin’ our
een and lookin’ at ither like daft folk. For wi’ the bang and the skirl
the thing had clean disappeared. The sun glintit, the wund blew, and
there was the bare yaird whaur the Wonder had been lowping and flinging
but ae second syne.

The hale way hame I roared and grat wi’ the terror o’ that
dispensation. The grawn folk were nane sae muckle better; there was
little said in Sandie’s boat but just the name of God; and when we won
in by the pier, the harbour rocks were fair black wi’ the folk waitin’
us. It seems they had fund Lapraik in ane of his dwams, cawing the
shuttle and smiling. Ae lad they sent to hoist the flag, and the rest
abode there in the wabster’s house. You may be sure they liked it
little; but it was a means of grace to severals that stood there
praying in to themsel’s (for nane cared to pray out loud) and looking
on thon awesome thing as it cawed the shuttle. Syne, upon a suddenty,
and wi’ the ae dreidfu’ skelloch, Tod sprang up frae his hinderlands
and fell forrit on the wab, a bluidy corp.

When the corp was examined the leid draps hadnae played buff upon the
warlock’s body; sorrow a leid drap was to be fund! but there was
grandfaither’s siller tester in the puddock’s heart of him.


Andie had scarce done when there befell a mighty silly affair that had
its consequence. Neil, as I have said, was himself a great narrator. I
have heard since that he knew all the stories in the Highlands; and
thought much of himself, and was thought much of by others on the
strength of it. Now Andie’s tale reminded him of one he had already
heard.

“She would ken that story afore,” he said. “She was the story of
Uistean More M’Gillie Phadrig and the Gavar Vore.”

“It is no sic a thing,” cried Andie. “It is the story of my faither
(now wi’ God) and Tod Lapraik. And the same in your beard,” says he;
“and keep the tongue of ye inside your Hielant chafts!”

In dealing with Highlanders it will be found, and has been shown in
history, how well it goes with Lowland gentlefolk; but the thing
appears scarce feasible for Lowland commons. I had already remarked
that Andie was continually on the point of quarrelling with our three
MacGregors, and now, sure enough, it was to come.

“Thir will be no words to use to shentlemans,” says Neil.

“Shentlemans!” cries Andie. “Shentlemans, ye hielant stot! If God would
give ye the grace to see yoursel’ the way that ithers see ye, ye would
throw your denner up.”

There came some kind of a Gaelic oath from Neil, and the black knife
was in his hand that moment.

There was no time to think; and I caught the Highlander by the leg, and
had him down, and his armed hand pinned out, before I knew what I was
doing. His comrades sprang to rescue him, Andie and I were without
weapons, the Gregara three to two. It seemed we were beyond salvation,
when Neil screamed in his own tongue, ordering the others back, and
made his submission to myself in a manner the most abject, even giving
me up his knife which (upon a repetition of his promises) I returned to
him on the morrow.

Two things I saw plain: the first, that I must not build too high on
Andie, who had shrunk against the wall and stood there, as pale as
death, till the affair was over; the second, the strength of my own
position with the Highlanders, who must have received extraordinary
charges to be tender of my safety. But if I thought Andie came not very
well out in courage, I had no fault to find with him upon the account
of gratitude. It was not so much that he troubled me with thanks, as
that his whole mind and manner appeared changed; and as he preserved
ever after a great timidity of our companions, he and I were yet more
constantly together.




CHAPTER XVI.
THE MISSING WITNESS


On the seventeenth, the day I was trysted with the Writer, I had much
rebellion against fate. The thought of him waiting in the _King’s
Arms_, and of what he would think, and what he would say when next we
met, tormented and oppressed me. The truth was unbelievable, so much I
had to grant, and it seemed cruel hard I should be posted as a liar and
a coward, and have never consciously omitted what it was possible that
I should do. I repeated this form of words with a kind of bitter
relish, and re-examined in that light the steps of my behaviour. It
seemed I had behaved to James Stewart as a brother might; all the past
was a picture that I could be proud of, and there was only the present
to consider. I could not swim the sea, nor yet fly in the air, but
there was always Andie. I had done him a service, he liked me; I had a
lever there to work on; if it were just for decency, I must try once
more with Andie.

It was late afternoon; there was no sound in all the Bass but the lap
and bubble of a very quiet sea; and my four companions were all crept
apart, the three Macgregors higher on the rock, and Andie with his
Bible to a sunny place among the ruins; there I found him in deep
sleep, and, as soon as he was awake, appealed to him with some fervour
of manner and a good show of argument.

“If I thoucht it was to do guid to ye, Shaws!” said he, staring at me
over his spectacles.

“It’s to save another,” said I, “and to redeem my word. What would be
more good than that? Do ye no mind the scripture, Andie? And you with
the Book upon your lap! _What shall it profit a man if he gain the
whole world_?”

“Ay,” said he, “that’s grand for you. But where do I come in! I have my
word to redeem the same’s yoursel’. And what are ye asking me to do,
but just to sell it ye for siller?”

“Andie! have I named the name of siller?” cried I.

“Ou, the name’s naething”, said he; “the thing is there, whatever. It
just comes to this; if I am to service ye the way that you propose,
I’ll lose my lifelihood. Then it’s clear ye’ll have to make it up to
me, and a pickle mair, for your ain credit like. And what’s that but
just a bribe? And if even I was certain of the bribe! But by a’ that I
can learn, it’s far frae that; and if _you_ were to hang, where would
_I_ be? Na: the thing’s no possible. And just awa’ wi’ ye like a bonny
lad! and let Andie read his chapter.”

I remember I was at bottom a good deal gratified with this result; and
the next humour I fell into was one (I had near said) of gratitude to
Prestongrange, who had saved me, in this violent, illegal manner, out
of the midst of my dangers, temptations, and perplexities. But this was
both too flimsy and too cowardly to last me long, and the remembrance
of James began to succeed to the possession of my spirits. The 21st,
the day set for the trial, I passed in such misery of mind as I can
scarce recall to have endured, save perhaps upon Isle Earraid only.
Much of the time I lay on a brae-side betwixt sleep and waking, my body
motionless, my mind full of violent thoughts. Sometimes I slept indeed;
but the court-house of Inverary and the prisoner glancing on all sides
to find his missing witness, followed me in slumber; and I would wake
again with a start to darkness of spirit and distress of body. I
thought Andie seemed to observe me, but I paid him little heed. Verily,
my bread was bitter to me, and my days a burthen.

Early the next morning (Friday, 22nd) a boat came with provisions, and
Andie placed a packet in my hand. The cover was without address but
sealed with a Government seal. It enclosed two notes. “Mr. Balfour can
now see for himself it is too late to meddle. His conduct will be
observed and his discretion rewarded.” So ran the first, which seemed
to be laboriously writ with the left hand. There was certainly nothing
in these expressions to compromise the writer, even if that person
could be found; the seal, which formidably served instead of signature,
was affixed to a separate sheet on which there was no scratch of
writing; and I had to confess that (so far) my adversaries knew what
they were doing, and to digest as well as I was able the threat that
peeped under the promise.

But the second enclosure was by far the more surprising. It was in a
lady’s hand of writ. “_Maister Dauvit Balfour is informed a friend was
speiring for him and her eyes were of the grey_,” it ran—and seemed so
extraordinary a piece to come to my hands at such a moment and under
cover of a Government seal, that I stood stupid. Catriona’s grey eyes
shone in my remembrance. I thought, with a bound of pleasure, she must
be the friend. But who should the writer be, to have her billet thus
enclosed with Prestongrange’s? And of all wonders, why was it thought
needful to give me this pleasing but most inconsequent intelligence
upon the Bass? For the writer, I could hit upon none possible except
Miss Grant. Her family, I remembered, had remarked on Catriona’s eyes
and even named her for their colour; and she herself had been much in
the habit to address me with a broad pronunciation, by way of a sniff,
I supposed, at my rusticity. No doubt, besides, but she lived in the
same house as this letter came from. So there remained but one step to
be accounted for; and that was how Prestongrange should have permitted
her at all in an affair so secret, or let her daft-like billet go in
the same cover with his own. But even here I had a glimmering. For,
first of all, there was something rather alarming about the young lady,
and papa might be more under her domination than I knew. And, second,
there was the man’s continual policy to be remembered, how his conduct
had been continually mingled with caresses, and he had scarce ever, in
the midst of so much contention, laid aside a mask of friendship. He
must conceive that my imprisonment had incensed me. Perhaps this little
jesting, friendly message was intended to disarm my rancour?

I will be honest—and I think it did. I felt a sudden warmth towards
that beautiful Miss Grant, that she should stoop to so much interest in
my affairs. The summoning up of Catriona moved me of itself to milder
and more cowardly counsels. If the Advocate knew of her and our
acquaintance—if I should please him by some of that “discretion” at
which his letter pointed—to what might not this lead! _In vain is the
net prepared in the sight of any fowl_, the Scripture says. Well, fowls
must be wiser than folk! For I thought I perceived the policy, and yet
fell in with it.

I was in this frame, my heart beating, the grey eyes plain before me
like two stars, when Andie broke in upon my musing.

“I see ye has gotten guid news,” said he.

I found him looking curiously in my face; with that there came before
me like a vision of James Stewart and the court of Inverary; and my
mind turned at once like a door upon its hinges. Trials, I reflected,
sometimes draw out longer than is looked for. Even if I came to
Inverary just too late, something might yet be attempted in the
interests of James—and in those of my own character, the best would be
accomplished. In a moment, it seemed without thought, I had a plan
devised.

“Andie,” said I, “is it still to be to-morrow?”

He told me nothing was changed.

“Was anything said about the hour?” I asked.

He told me it was to be two o’clock afternoon.

“And about the place?” I pursued.

“Whatten place?” says Andie.

“The place I am to be landed at?” said I.

He owned there was nothing as to that.

“Very well, then,” I said, “this shall be mine to arrange. The wind is
in the east, my road lies westward: keep your boat, I hire it; let us
work up the Forth all day; and land me at two o’clock to-morrow at the
westmost we’ll can have reached.”

“Ye daft callant!” he cried; “ye would try for Inverary after a’!”

“Just that, Andie,” says I.

“Weel, ye’re ill to beat!” says he. “And I was a kind o’ sorry for ye
a’ day yesterday,” he added. “Ye see, I was never entirely sure till
then, which way of it ye really wantit.”

Here was a spur to a lame horse!

“A word in your ear, Andie,” said I. “This plan of mine has another
advantage yet. We can leave these Hielandman behind us on the rock, and
one of your boats from the Castleton can bring them off to-morrow. Yon
Neil has a queer eye when he regards you; maybe, if I was once out of
the gate there might be knives again; these red-shanks are unco
grudgeful. And if there should come to be any question, here is your
excuse. Our lives were in danger by these savages; being answerable for
my safety, you chose the part to bring me from their neighbourhood and
detain me the rest of the time on board your boat: and do you know,
Andie?” says I, with a smile, “I think it was very wisely chosen.”

“The truth is I have nae goo for Neil,” says Andie, “nor he for me, I’m
thinking; and I would like ill to come to my hands wi’ the man. Tam
Anster will make a better hand of it with the cattle onyway.” (For this
man, Anster, came from Fife, where the Gaelic is still spoken.) “Ay,
ay!” says Andie, “Tam’ll can deal with them the best. And troth! the
mair I think of it, the less I see we would be required. The place—ay,
feggs! they had forgot the place. Eh, Shaws, ye’re a lang-heided chield
when ye like! Forby that I’m awing ye my life,” he added, with more
solemnity, and offered me his hand upon the bargain.

Whereupon, with scarce more words, we stepped suddenly on board the
boat, cast off, and set the lug. The Gregara were then busy upon
breakfast, for the cookery was their usual part; but, one of them
stepping to the battlements, our flight was observed before we were
twenty fathoms from the rock; and the three of them ran about the ruins
and the landing-shelf, for all the world like ants about a broken nest,
hailing and crying on us to return. We were still in both the lee and
the shadow of the rock, which last lay broad upon the waters, but
presently came forth in almost the same moment into the wind and
sunshine; the sail filled, the boat heeled to the gunwale, and we swept
immediately beyond sound of the men’s voices. To what terrors they
endured upon the rock, where they were now deserted without the
countenance of any civilised person or so much as the protection of a
Bible, no limit can be set; nor had they any brandy left to be their
consolation, for even in the haste and secrecy of our departure Andie
had managed to remove it.

It was our first care to set Anster ashore in a cove by the Glenteithy
Rocks, so that the deliverance of our maroons might be duly seen to the
next day. Thence we kept away up Firth. The breeze, which was then so
spirited, swiftly declined, but never wholly failed us. All day we kept
moving, though often not much more; and it was after dark ere we were
up with the Queensferry. To keep the letter of Andie’s engagement (or
what was left of it) I must remain on board, but I thought no harm to
communicate with the shore in writing. On Prestongrange’s cover, where
the Government seal must have a good deal surprised my correspondent, I
writ, by the boat’s lantern, a few necessary words, aboard and Andie
carried them to Rankeillor. In about an hour he came again, with a
purse of money and the assurance that a good horse should be standing
saddled for me by two to-morrow at Clackmannan Pool. This done, and the
boat riding by her stone anchor, we lay down to sleep under the sail.

We were in the Pool the next day long ere two; and there was nothing
left for me but to sit and wait. I felt little alacrity upon my errand.
I would have been glad of any passable excuse to lay it down; but none
being to be found, my uneasiness was no less great than if I had been
running to some desired pleasure. By shortly after one the horse was at
the waterside, and I could see a man walking it to and fro till I
should land, which vastly swelled my impatience. Andie ran the moment
of my liberation very fine, showing himself a man of his bare word, but
scarce serving his employers with a heaped measure; and by about fifty
seconds after two I was in the saddle and on the full stretch for
Stirling. In a little more than an hour I had passed that town, and was
already mounting Alan Water side, when the weather broke in a small
tempest. The rain blinded me, the wind had nearly beat me from the
saddle, and the first darkness of the night surprised me in a
wilderness still some way east of Balwhidder, not very sure of my
direction and mounted on a horse that began already to be weary.

In the press of my hurry, and to be spared the delay and annoyance of a
guide, I had followed (so far as it was possible for any horseman) the
line of my journey with Alan. This I did with open eyes, foreseeing a
great risk in it, which the tempest had now brought to a reality. The
last that I knew of where I was, I think it must have been about Uam
Var; the hour perhaps six at night. I must still think it great good
fortune that I got about eleven to my destination, the house of Duncan
Dhu. Where I had wandered in the interval perhaps the horse could tell.
I know we were twice down, and once over the saddle and for a moment
carried away in a roaring burn. Steed and rider were bemired up to the
eyes.

From Duncan I had news of the trial. It was followed in all these
Highland regions with religious interest; news of it spread from
Inverary as swift as men could travel; and I was rejoiced to learn
that, up to a late hour that Saturday it was not yet concluded; and all
men began to suppose it must spread over the Monday. Under the spur of
this intelligence I would not sit to eat; but, Duncan having agreed to
be my guide, took the road again on foot, with the piece in my hand and
munching as I went. Duncan brought with him a flask of usquebaugh and a
hand-lantern; which last enlightened us just so long as we could find
houses where to rekindle it, for the thing leaked outrageously and blew
out with every gust. The more part of the night we walked blindfold
among sheets of rain, and day found us aimless on the mountains. Hard
by we struck a hut on a burn-side, where we got bite and a direction;
and, a little before the end of the sermon, came to the kirk doors of
Inverary.

The rain had somewhat washed the upper parts of me, but I was still
bogged as high as to the knees; I streamed water; I was so weary I
could hardly limp, and my face was like a ghost’s. I stood certainly
more in need of a change of raiment and a bed to lie on, than of all
the benefits in Christianity. For all which (being persuaded the chief
point for me was to make myself immediately public) I set the door of
the church with the dirty Duncan at my tails, and finding a vacant
place sat down.

“Thirteently, my brethren, and in parenthesis, the law itself must be
regarded as a means of grace,” the minister was saying, in the voice of
one delighting to pursue an argument.

The sermon was in English on account of the assize. The judges were
present with their armed attendants, the halberts glittered in a corner
by the door, and the seats were thronged beyond custom with the array
of lawyers. The text was in Romans 5th and 13th—the minister a skilled
hand; and the whole of that able churchful—from Argyle, and my Lords
Elchies and Kilkerran, down to the halbertmen that came in their
attendance—was sunk with gathered brows in a profound critical
attention. The minister himself and a sprinkling of those about the
door observed our entrance at the moment and immediately forgot the
same; the rest either did not hear or would not hear or would not be
heard; and I sat amongst my friends and enemies unremarked.

The first that I singled out was Prestongrange. He sat well forward,
like an eager horseman in the saddle, his lips moving with relish, his
eyes glued on the minister; the doctrine was clearly to his mind.
Charles Stewart, on the other hand, was half asleep, and looked
harassed and pale. As for Simon Fraser, he appeared like a blot, and
almost a scandal, in the midst of that attentive congregation, digging
his hands in his pockets, shifting his legs, clearing his throat, and
rolling up his bald eyebrows and shooting out his eyes to right and
left, now with a yawn, now with a secret smile. At times, too, he would
take the Bible in front of him, run it through, seem to read a bit, run
it through again, and stop and yawn prodigiously: the whole as if for
exercise.

In the course of this restlessness his eye alighted on myself. He sat a
second stupefied, then tore a half-leaf out of the Bible, scrawled upon
it with a pencil, and passed it with a whispered word to his next
neighbour. The note came to Prestongrange, who gave me but the one
look; thence it voyaged to the hands of Mr. Erskine; thence again to
Argyle, where he sat between the other two lords of session, and his
Grace turned and fixed me with an arrogant eye. The last of those
interested in my presence was Charlie Stewart, and he too began to
pencil and hand about dispatches, none of which I was able to trace to
their destination in the crowd.

But the passage of these notes had aroused notice; all who were in the
secret (or supposed themselves to be so) were whispering
information—the rest questions; and the minister himself seemed quite
discountenanced by the flutter in the church and sudden stir and
whispering. His voice changed, he plainly faltered, nor did he again
recover the easy conviction and full tones of his delivery. It would be
a puzzle to him till his dying day, why a sermon that had gone with
triumph through four parts, should thus miscarry in the fifth.

As for me, I continued to sit there, very wet and weary, and a good
deal anxious as to what should happen next, but greatly exulting in my
success.




CHAPTER XVII.
THE MEMORIAL


The last word of the blessing was scarce out of the minister’s mouth
before Stewart had me by the arm. We were the first to be forth of the
church, and he made such extraordinary expedition that we were safe
within the four walls of a house before the street had begun to be
thronged with the home-going congregation.

“Am I yet in time?” I asked.

“Ay and no,” said he. “The case is over; the jury is enclosed, and will
so kind as let us ken their view of it to-morrow in the morning, the
same as I could have told it my own self three days ago before the play
began. The thing has been public from the start. The panel kent it,
‘_Ye may do what ye will for me_,’ whispers he two days ago. ‘_Ye ken
my fate by what the Duke of Argyle has just said to Mr. Macintosh_.’ O,
it’s been a scandal!

“The great Agyle he gaed before,
He gart the cannons and guns to roar,”


and the very macer cried ‘Cruachan!’ But now that I have got you again
I’ll never despair. The oak shall go over the myrtle yet; we’ll ding
the Campbells yet in their own town. Praise God that I should see the
day!”

He was leaping with excitement, emptied out his mails upon the floor
that I might have a change of clothes, and incommoded me with his
assistance as I changed. What remained to be done, or how I was to do
it, was what he never told me nor, I believe, so much as thought of.
“We’ll ding the Campbells yet!” that was still his overcome. And it was
forced home upon my mind how this, that had the externals of a sober
process of law, was in its essence a clan battle between savage clans.
I thought my friend the Writer none of the least savage. Who that had
only seen him at a counsel’s back before the Lord Ordinary or following
a golf ball and laying down his clubs on Bruntsfield links, could have
recognised for the same person this voluble and violent clansman?

James Stewart’s counsel were four in number—Sheriffs Brown of Colstoun
and Miller, Mr. Robert Macintosh, and Mr. Stewart younger of Stewart
Hall. These were covenanted to dine with the Writer after sermon, and I
was very obligingly included of the party. No sooner the cloth lifted,
and the first bowl very artfully compounded by Sheriff Miller, than we
fell to the subject in hand. I made a short narration of my seizure and
captivity, and was then examined and re-examined upon the circumstances
of the murder. It will be remembered this was the first time I had had
my say out, or the matter at all handled, among lawyers; and the
consequence was very dispiriting to the others and (I must own)
disappointing to myself.

“To sum up,” said Colstoun, “you prove that Alan was on the spot; you
have heard him proffer menaces against Glenure; and though you assure
us he was not the man who fired, you leave a strong impression that he
was in league with him, and consenting, perhaps immediately assisting,
in the act. You show him besides, at the risk of his own liberty,
actively furthering the criminal’s escape. And the rest of your
testimony (so far as the least material) depends on the bare word of
Alan or of James, the two accused. In short, you do not at all break,
but only lengthen by one personage, the chain that binds our client to
the murderer; and I need scarcely say that the introduction of a third
accomplice rather aggravates that appearance of a conspiracy which has
been our stumbling block from the beginning.”

“I am of the same opinion,” said Sheriff Miller. “I think we may all be
very much obliged to Prestongrange for taking a most uncomfortable
witness out of our way. And chiefly, I think, Mr. Balfour himself might
be obliged. For you talk of a third accomplice, but Mr. Balfour (in my
view) has very much the appearance of a fourth.”

“Allow me, sirs!” interposed Stewart the Writer. “There is another
view. Here we have a witness—never fash whether material or not—a
witness in this cause, kidnapped by that old, lawless, bandit crew of
the Glengyle Macgregors, and sequestered for near upon a month in a
bourock of old ruins on the Bass. Move that and see what dirt you fling
on the proceedings! Sirs, this is a tale to make the world ring with!
It would be strange, with such a grip as this, if we couldnae squeeze
out a pardon for my client.”

“And suppose we took up Mr. Balfour’s cause to-morrow?” said Stewart
Hall. “I am much deceived or we should find so many impediments thrown
in our path, as that James should have been hanged before we had found
a court to hear us. This is a great scandal, but I suppose we have none
of us forgot a greater still, I mean the matter of the Lady Grange. The
woman was still in durance; my friend Mr. Hope of Rankeillor did what
was humanly possible; and how did he speed? He never got a warrant!
Well, it’ll be the same now; the same weapons will be used. This is a
scene, gentleman, of clan animosity. The hatred of the name which I
have the honour to bear, rages in high quarters. There is nothing here
to be viewed but naked Campbell spite and scurvy Campbell intrigue.”

You may be sure this was to touch a welcome topic, and I sat for some
time in the midst of my learned counsel, almost deaved with their talk
but extremely little the wiser for its purport. The Writer was led into
some hot expressions; Colstoun must take him up and set him right; the
rest joined in on different sides, but all pretty noisy; the Duke of
Argyle was beaten like a blanket; King George came in for a few digs in
the by-going and a great deal of rather elaborate defence; and there
was only one person that seemed to be forgotten, and that was James of
the Glens.

Through all this Mr. Miller sat quiet. He was a slip of an oldish
gentleman, ruddy and twinkling; he spoke in a smooth rich voice, with
an infinite effect of pawkiness, dealing out each word the way an actor
does, to give the most expression possible; and even now, when he was
silent, and sat there with his wig laid aside, his glass in both hands,
his mouth funnily pursed, and his chin out, he seemed the mere picture
of a merry slyness. It was plain he had a word to say, and waited for
the fit occasion.

It came presently. Colstoun had wound up one of his speeches with some
expression of their duty to their client. His brother sheriff was
pleased, I suppose, with the transition. He took the table in his
confidence with a gesture and a look.

“That suggests to me a consideration which seems overlooked,” said he.
“The interest of our client goes certainly before all, but the world
does not come to an end with James Stewart.” Whereat he cocked his eye.
“I might condescend, _exempli gratia_, upon a Mr. George Brown, a Mr.
Thomas Miller, and a Mr. David Balfour. Mr. David Balfour has a very
good ground of complaint, and I think, gentlemen—if his story was
properly redd out—I think there would be a number of wigs on the
green.”

The whole table turned to him with a common movement.

“Properly handled and carefully redd out, his is a story that could
scarcely fail to have some consequence,” he continued. “The whole
administration of justice, from its highest officer downward, would be
totally discredited; and it looks to me as if they would need to be
replaced.” He seemed to shine with cunning as he said it. “And I need
not point out to ye that this of Mr. Balfour’s would be a remarkable
bonny cause to appear in,” he added.

Well, there they all were started on another hare; Mr. Balfour’s cause,
and what kind of speeches could be there delivered, and what officials
could be thus turned out, and who would succeed to their positions. I
shall give but the two specimens. It was proposed to approach Simon
Fraser, whose testimony, if it could be obtained, would prove certainly
fatal to Argyle and to Prestongrange. Miller highly approved of the
attempt. “We have here before us a dreeping roast,” said he, “here is
cut-and-come-again for all.” And methought all licked their lips. The
other was already near the end. Stewart the Writer was out of the body
with delight, smelling vengeance on his chief enemy, the Duke.

“Gentlemen,” cried he, charging his glass, “here is to Sheriff Miller.
His legal abilities are known to all. His culinary, this bowl in front
of us is here to speak for. But when it comes to the poleetical!”—cries
he, and drains the glass.

“Ay, but it will hardly prove politics in your meaning, my friend,”
said the gratified Miller. “A revolution, if you like, and I think I
can promise you that historical writers shall date from Mr. Balfour’s
cause. But properly guided, Mr. Stewart, tenderly guided, it shall
prove a peaceful revolution.”

“And if the damned Campbells get their ears rubbed, what care I?” cries
Stewart, smiting down his fist.

It will be thought I was not very well pleased with all this, though I
could scarce forbear smiling at a kind of innocency in these old
intriguers. But it was not my view to have undergone so many sorrows
for the advancement of Sheriff Miller or to make a revolution in the
Parliament House: and I interposed accordingly with as much simplicity
of manner as I could assume.

“I have to thank you, gentlemen, for your advice,” said I. “And now I
would like, by your leave, to set you two or three questions. There is
one thing that has fallen rather on one aide, for instance: Will this
cause do any good to our friend James of the Glens?”

They seemed all a hair set back, and gave various answers, but
concurring practically in one point, that James had now no hope but in
the King’s mercy.

“To proceed, then,” said I, “will it do any good to Scotland? We have a
saying that it is an ill bird that fouls his own nest. I remember
hearing we had a riot in Edinburgh when I was an infant child, which
gave occasion to the late Queen to call this country barbarous; and I
always understood that we had rather lost than gained by that. Then
came the year ’Forty-five, which made Scotland to be talked of
everywhere; but I never heard it said we had anyway gained by the
’Forty-five. And now we come to this cause of Mr. Balfour’s, as you
call it. Sheriff Miller tells us historical writers are to date from
it, and I would not wonder. It is only my fear they would date from it
as a period of calamity and public reproach.”

The nimble-witted Miller had already smelt where I was travelling to,
and made haste to get on the same road. “Forcibly put, Mr. Balfour,”
says he. “A weighty observe, sir.”

“We have next to ask ourselves if it will be good for King George,” I
pursued. “Sheriff Miller appears pretty easy upon this; but I doubt you
will scarce be able to pull down the house from under him, without his
Majesty coming by a knock or two, one of which might easily prove
fatal.”

I gave them a chance to answer, but none volunteered.

“Of those for whom the case was to be profitable,” I went on, “Sheriff
Miller gave us the names of several, among the which he was good enough
to mention mine. I hope he will pardon me if I think otherwise. I
believe I hung not the least back in this affair while there was life
to be saved; but I own I thought myself extremely hazarded, and I own I
think it would be a pity for a young man, with some idea of coming to
the Bar, to ingrain upon himself the character of a turbulent, factious
fellow before he was yet twenty. As for James, it seems—at this date of
the proceedings, with the sentence as good as pronounced—he has no hope
but in the King’s mercy. May not his Majesty, then, be more pointedly
addressed, the characters of these high officers sheltered from the
public, and myself kept out of a position which I think spells ruin for
me?”

They all sat and gazed into their glasses, and I could see they found
my attitude on the affair unpalatable. But Miller was ready at all
events.

“If I may be allowed to put my young friend’s notion in more formal
shape,” says he, “I understand him to propose that we should embody the
fact of his sequestration, and perhaps some heads of the testimony he
was prepared to offer, in a memorial to the Crown. This plan has
elements of success. It is as likely as any other (and perhaps
likelier) to help our client. Perhaps his Majesty would have the
goodness to feel a certain gratitude to all concerned in such a
memorial, which might be construed into an expression of a very
delicate loyalty; and I think, in the drafting of the same, this view
might be brought forward.”

They all nodded to each other, not without sighs, for the former
alternative was doubtless more after their inclination.

“Paper, then, Mr. Stewart, if you please,” pursued Miller; “and I think
it might very fittingly be signed by the five of us here present, as
procurators for the condemned man.”’

“It can do none of us any harm, at least,” says Colstoun, heaving
another sigh, for he had seen himself Lord Advocate the last ten
minutes.

Thereupon they set themselves, not very enthusiastically, to draft the
memorial—a process in the course of which they soon caught fire; and I
had no more ado but to sit looking on and answer an occasional
question. The paper was very well expressed; beginning with a
recitation of the facts about myself, the reward offered for my
apprehension, my surrender, the pressure brought to bear upon me; my
sequestration; and my arrival at Inverary in time to be too late; going
on to explain the reasons of loyalty and public interest for which it
was agreed to waive any right of action; and winding up with a forcible
appeal to the King’s mercy on behalf of James.

Methought I was a good deal sacrificed, and rather represented in the
light of a firebrand of a fellow whom my cloud of lawyers had
restrained with difficulty from extremes. But I let it pass, and made
but the one suggestion, that I should be described as ready to deliver
my own evidence and adduce that of others before any commission of
inquiry—and the one demand, that I should be immediately furnished with
a copy.

Colstoun hummed and hawed. “This is a very confidential document,” said
he.

“And my position towards Prestongrange is highly peculiar,” I replied.
“No question but I must have touched his heart at our first interview,
so that he has since stood my friend consistently. But for him,
gentlemen, I must now be lying dead or awaiting my sentence alongside
poor James. For which reason I choose to communicate to him the fact of
this memorial as soon as it is copied. You are to consider also that
this step will make for my protection. I have enemies here accustomed
to drive hard; his Grace is in his own country, Lovat by his side; and
if there should hang any ambiguity over our proceedings I think I might
very well awake in gaol.”

Not finding any very ready answer to these considerations, my company
of advisers were at the last persuaded to consent, and made only this
condition that I was to lay the paper before Prestongrange with the
express compliments of all concerned.

The Advocate was at the castle dining with his Grace. By the hand of
one of Colstoun’s servants I sent him a billet asking for an interview,
and received a summons to meet him at once in a private house of the
town. Here I found him alone in a chamber; from his face there was
nothing to be gleaned; yet I was not so unobservant but what I spied
some halberts in the hall, and not so stupid but what I could gather he
was prepared to arrest me there and then, should it appear advisable.

“So, Mr. David, this is you?” said he.

“Where I fear I am not overly welcome, my lord,” said I. “And I would
like before I go further to express my sense of your lordship’s good
offices, even should they now cease.”

“I have heard of your gratitude before,” he replied drily, “and I think
this can scarce be the matter you called me from my wine to listen to.
I would remember also, if I were you, that you still stand on a very
boggy foundation.”

“Not now, my lord, I think,” said I; “and if your lordship will but
glance an eye along this, you will perhaps think as I do.”

He read it sedulously through, frowning heavily; then turned back to
one part and another which he seemed to weigh and compare the effect
of. His face a little lightened.

“This is not so bad but what it might be worse,” said he; “though I am
still likely to pay dear for my acquaintance with Mr. David Balfour.”

“Rather for your indulgence to that unlucky young man, my lord,” said
I.

He still skimmed the paper, and all the while his spirits seemed to
mend.

“And to whom am I indebted for this?” he asked presently. “Other
counsels must have been discussed, I think. Who was it proposed this
private method? Was it Miller?”

“My lord, it was myself,” said I. “These gentlemen have shown me no
such consideration, as that I should deny myself any credit I can
fairly claim, or spare them any responsibility they should properly
bear. And the mere truth is, that they were all in favour of a process
which should have remarkable consequences in the Parliament House, and
prove for them (in one of their own expressions) a dripping roast.
Before I intervened, I think they were on the point of sharing out the
different law appointments. Our friend Mr. Simon was to be taken in
upon some composition.”

Prestongrange smiled. “These are our friends,” said he. “And what were
your reasons for dissenting, Mr. David?”

I told them without concealment, expressing, however, with more force
and volume those which regarded Prestongrange himself.

“You do me no more than justice,” said he. “I have fought as hard in
your interest as you have fought against mine. And how came you here
to-day?” he asked. “As the case drew out, I began to grow uneasy that I
had clipped the period so fine, and I was even expecting you to-morrow.
But to-day—I never dreamed of it.”

I was not of course, going to betray Andie.

“I suspect there is some very weary cattle by the road,” said I.

“If I had known you were such a mosstrooper you should have tasted
longer of the Bass,” says he.

“Speaking of which, my lord, I return your letter.” And I gave him the
enclosure in the counterfeit hand.

“There was the cover also with the seal,” said he.

“I have it not,” said I. “It bore not even an address, and could not
compromise a cat. The second enclosure I have, and with your
permission, I desire to keep it.”

I thought he winced a little, but he said nothing to the point.
“To-morrow,” he resumed, “our business here is to be finished, and I
proceed by Glasgow. I would be very glad to have you of my party, Mr
David.”

“My lord . . .” I began.

“I do not deny it will be of service to me,” he interrupted. “I desire
even that, when we shall come to Edinburgh, you should alight at my
house. You have very warm friends in the Miss Grants, who will be
overjoyed to have you to themselves. If you think I have been of use to
you, you can thus easily repay me, and so far from losing, may reap
some advantage by the way. It is not every strange young man who is
presented in society by the King’s Advocate.”

Often enough already (in our brief relations) this gentleman had caused
my head to spin; no doubt but what for a moment he did so again now.
Here was the old fiction still maintained of my particular favour with
his daughters, one of whom had been so good as to laugh at me, while
the other two had scarce deigned to remark the fact of my existence.
And now I was to ride with my lord to Glasgow; I was to dwell with him
in Edinburgh; I was to be brought into society under his protection!
That he should have so much good-nature as to forgive me was surprising
enough; that he could wish to take me up and serve me seemed
impossible; and I began to seek some ulterior meaning. One was plain.
If I became his guest, repentance was excluded; I could never think
better of my present design and bring any action. And besides, would
not my presence in his house draw out the whole pungency of the
memorial? For that complaint could not be very seriously regarded, if
the person chiefly injured was the guest of the official most
incriminated. As I thought upon this I could not quite refrain from
smiling.

“This is in the nature of a countercheck to the memorial?” said I.

“You are cunning, Mr. David,” said he, “and you do not wholly guess
wrong the fact will be of use to me in my defence. Perhaps, however,
you underrate friendly sentiments, which are perfectly genuine. I have
a respect for you, David, mingled with awe,” says he, smiling.

“I am more than willing, I am earnestly desirous to meet your wishes,”
said I. “It is my design to be called to the Bar, where your lordship’s
countenance would be invaluable; and I am besides sincerely grateful to
yourself and family for different marks of interest and of indulgence.
The difficulty is here. There is one point in which we pull two ways.
You are trying to hang James Stewart, I am trying to save him. In so
far as my riding with you would better your lordship’s defence, I am at
your lordships orders; but in so far as it would help to hang James
Stewart, you see me at a stick.”

I thought he swore to himself. “You should certainly be called; the Bar
is the true scene for your talents,” says he, bitterly, and then fell a
while silent. “I will tell you,” he presently resumed, “there is no
question of James Stewart, for or against, James is a dead man; his
life is given and taken—bought (if you like it better) and sold; no
memorial can help—no defalcation of a faithful Mr. David hurt him. Blow
high, blow low, there will be no pardon for James Stewart: and take
that for said! The question is now of myself: am I to stand or fall?
and I do not deny to you that I am in some danger. But will Mr. David
Balfour consider why? It is not because I pushed the case unduly
against James; for that, I am sure of condonation. And it is not
because I have sequestered Mr. David on a rock, though it will pass
under that colour; but because I did not take the ready and plain path,
to which I was pressed repeatedly, and send Mr. David to his grave or
to the gallows. Hence the scandal—hence this damned memorial,” striking
the paper on his leg. “My tenderness for you has brought me in this
difficulty. I wish to know if your tenderness to your own conscience is
too great to let you help me out of it.”

No doubt but there was much of the truth in what he said; if James was
past helping, whom was it more natural that I should turn to help than
just the man before me, who had helped myself so often, and was even
now setting me a pattern of patience? I was besides not only weary, but
beginning to be ashamed, of my perpetual attitude of suspicion and
refusal.

“If you will name the time and place, I will be punctually ready to
attend your lordship,” said I.

He shook hands with me. “And I think my misses have some news for you,”
says he, dismissing me.

I came away, vastly pleased to have my peace made, yet a little
concerned in conscience; nor could I help wondering, as I went back,
whether, perhaps, I had not been a scruple too good-natured. But there
was the fact, that this was a man that might have been my father, an
able man, a great dignitary, and one that, in the hour of my need, had
reached a hand to my assistance. I was in the better humour to enjoy
the remainder of that evening, which I passed with the advocates, in
excellent company no doubt, but perhaps with rather more than a
sufficiency of punch: for though I went early to bed I have no clear
mind of how I got there.




CHAPTER XVIII.
THE TEE’D BALL


On the morrow, from the justices’ private room, where none could see
me, I heard the verdict given in and judgment rendered upon James. The
Duke’s words I am quite sure I have correctly; and since that famous
passage has been made a subject of dispute, I may as well commemorate
my version. Having referred to the year ’45, the chief of the
Campbells, sitting as Justice-General upon the bench, thus addressed
the unfortunate Stewart before him: “If you had been successful in that
rebellion, you might have been giving the law where you have now
received the judgment of it; we, who are this day your judges, might
have been tried before one of your mock courts of judicature; and then
you might have been satiated with the blood of any name or clan to
which you had an aversion.”

“This is to let the cat out of the bag, indeed,” thought I. And that
was the general impression. It was extraordinary how the young advocate
lads took hold and made a mock of this speech, and how scarce a meal
passed but what someone would get in the words: “And then you might
have been satiated.” Many songs were made in time for the hour’s
diversion, and are near all forgot. I remember one began:

“What do ye want the bluid of, bluid of?
Is it a name, or is it a clan,
Or is it an aefauld Hielandman,
That ye want the bluid of, bluid of?”


Another went to my old favourite air, _The House of Airlie_, and began
thus:

“It fell on a day when Argyle was on the bench,
That they served him a Stewart for his denner.”


And one of the verses ran:

“Then up and spak’ the Duke, and flyted on his cook,
I regard it as a sensible aspersion,
That I would sup ava’, an’ satiate my maw,
With the bluid of ony clan of my aversion.”


James was as fairly murdered as though the Duke had got a fowling-piece
and stalked him. So much of course I knew: but others knew not so much,
and were more affected by the items of scandal that came to light in
the progress of the cause. One of the chief was certainly this sally of
the justice’s. It was run hard by another of a juryman, who had struck
into the midst of Coulston’s speech for the defence with a “Pray, sir,
cut it short, we are quite weary,” which seemed the very excess of
impudence and simplicity. But some of my new lawyer friends were still
more staggered with an innovation that had disgraced and even vitiated
the proceedings. One witness was never called. His name, indeed, was
printed, where it may still be seen on the fourth page of the list:
“James Drummond, _alias_ Macgregor, _alias_ James More, late tenant in
Inveronachile”; and his precognition had been taken, as the manner is,
in writing. He had remembered or invented (God help him) matter which
was lead in James Stewart’s shoes, and I saw was like to prove wings to
his own. This testimony it was highly desirable to bring to the notice
of the jury, without exposing the man himself to the perils of
cross-examination; and the way it was brought about was a matter of
surprise to all. For the paper was handed round (like a curiosity) in
court; passed through the jury-box, where it did its work; and
disappeared again (as though by accident) before it reached the counsel
for the prisoner. This was counted a most insidious device; and that
the name of James More should be mingled up with it filled me with
shame for Catriona and concern for myself.

The following day, Prestongrange and I, with a considerable company,
set out for Glasgow, where (to my impatience) we continued to linger
some time in a mixture of pleasure and affairs. I lodged with my lord,
with whom I was encouraged to familiarity; had my place at
entertainments; was presented to the chief guests; and altogether made
more of than I thought accorded either with my parts or station; so
that, on strangers being present, I would often blush for
Prestongrange. It must be owned the view I had taken of the world in
these last months was fit to cast a gloom upon my character. I had met
many men, some of them leaders in Israel whether by their birth or
talents; and who among them all had shown clean hands? As for the
Browns and Millers, I had seen their self-seeking, I could never again
respect them. Prestongrange was the best yet; he had saved me, spared
me rather, when others had it in their minds to murder me outright; but
the blood of James lay at his door; and I thought his present
dissimulation with myself a thing below pardon. That he should affect
to find pleasure in my discourse almost surprised me out of my
patience. I would sit and watch him with a kind of a slow fire of anger
in my bowels. “Ah, friend, friend,” I would think to myself, “if you
were but through with this affair of the memorial, would you not kick
me in the streets?” Here I did him, as events have proved, the most
grave injustice; and I think he was at once far more sincere, and a far
more artful performer, than I supposed.

But I had some warrant for my incredulity in the behaviour of that
court of young advocates that hung about in the hope of patronage. The
sudden favour of a lad not previously heard of troubled them at first
out of measure; but two days were not gone by before I found myself
surrounded with flattery and attention. I was the same young man, and
neither better nor bonnier, that they had rejected a month before; and
now there was no civility too fine for me! The same, do I say? It was
not so; and the by-name by which I went behind my back confirmed it.
Seeing me so firm with the Advocate, and persuaded that I was to fly
high and far, they had taken a word from the golfing green, and called
me _the Tee’d Ball_. [14] I was told I was now “one of themselves”; I
was to taste of their soft lining, who had already made my own
experience of the roughness of the outer husk; and one, to whom I had
been presented in Hope Park, was so aspired as even to remind me of
that meeting. I told him I had not the pleasure of remembering it.

“Why” says he, “it was Miss Grant herself presented me! My name is
so-and-so.”

“It may very well be, sir,” said I; “but I have kept no mind of it.”

At which he desisted; and in the midst of the disgust that commonly
overflowed my spirits I had a glisk of pleasure.

But I have not patience to dwell upon that time at length. When I was
in company with these young politics I was borne down with shame for
myself and my own plain ways, and scorn for them and their duplicity.
Of the two evils, I thought Prestongrange to be the least; and while I
was always as stiff as buckram to the young bloods, I made rather a
dissimulation of my hard feelings towards the Advocate, and was (in old
Mr. Campbell’s word) “soople to the laird.” Himself commented on the
difference, and bid me be more of my age, and make friends with my
young comrades.

I told him I was slow of making friends.

“I will take the word back,” said he. “But there is such a thing as
_Fair gude s’en and fair gude day_, Mr. David. These are the same young
men with whom you are to pass your days and get through life: your
backwardness has a look of arrogance; and unless you can assume a
little more lightness of manner, I fear you will meet difficulties in
the path.”

“It will be an ill job to make a silk purse of a sow’s ear,” said I.

On the morning of October 1st I was awakened by the clattering in of an
express; and getting to my window almost before he had dismounted, I
saw the messenger had ridden hard. Somewhile after I was called to
Prestongrange, where he was sitting in his bedgown and nightcap, with
his letters round him.

“Mr. David,” add he, “I have a piece of news for you. It concerns some
friends of yours, of whom I sometimes think you are a little ashamed,
for you have never referred to their existence.”

I suppose I blushed.

“See you understand, since you make the answering signal,” said he.
“And I must compliment you on your excellent taste in beauty. But do
you know, Mr. David? this seems to me a very enterprising lass. She
crops up from every side. The Government of Scotland appears unable to
proceed for Mistress Katrine Drummond, which was somewhat the case (no
great while back) with a certain Mr. David Balfour. Should not these
make a good match? Her first intromission in politics—but I must not
tell you that story, the authorities have decided you are to hear it
otherwise and from a livelier narrator. This new example is more
serious, however; and I am afraid I must alarm you with the
intelligence that she is now in prison.”

I cried out.

“Yes,” said he, “the little lady is in prison. But I would not have you
to despair. Unless you (with your friends and memorials) shall procure
my downfall, she is to suffer nothing.”

“But what has she done? What is her offence?” I cried.

“It might be almost construed a high treason,” he returned, “for she
has broke the king’s Castle of Edinburgh.”

“The lady is much my friend,” I said. “I know you would not mock me if
the thing were serious.”

“And yet it is serious in a sense,” said he; “for this rogue of a
Katrine—or Cateran, as we may call her—has set adrift again upon the
world that very doubtful character, her papa.”

Here was one of my previsions justified: James More was once again at
liberty. He had lent his men to keep me a prisoner; he had volunteered
his testimony in the Appin case, and the same (no matter by what
subterfuge) had been employed to influence the jury. Now came his
reward, and he was free. It might please the authorities to give to it
the colour of an escape; but I knew better—I knew it must be the
fulfilment of a bargain. The same course of thought relieved me of the
least alarm for Catriona. She might be thought to have broke prison for
her father; she might have believed so herself. But the chief hand in
the whole business was that of Prestongrange; and I was sure, so far
from letting her come to punishment, he would not suffer her to be even
tried. Whereupon thus came out of me the not very politic ejaculation:

“Ah! I was expecting that!”

“You have at times a great deal of discretion, too!” says
Prestongrange.

“And what is my lord pleased to mean by that?” I asked.

“I was just marvelling”, he replied, “that being so clever as to draw
these inferences, you should not be clever enough to keep them to
yourself. But I think you would like to hear the details of the affair.
I have received two versions: and the least official is the more full
and far the more entertaining, being from the lively pen of my eldest
daughter. ‘Here is all the town bizzing with a fine piece of work,’ she
writes, ‘and what would make the thing more noted (if it were only
known) the malefactor is a _protégée_ of his lordship my papa. I am
sure your heart is too much in your duty (if it were nothing else) to
have forgotten Grey Eyes. What does she do, but get a broad hat with
the flaps open, a long hairy-like man’s greatcoat, and a big gravatt;
kilt her coats up to _Gude kens whaur_, clap two pair of boot-hose upon
her legs, take a pair of _clouted brogues_ [15] in her hand, and off to
the Castle! Here she gives herself out to be a soutar [16] in the
employ of James More, and gets admitted to his cell, the lieutenant
(who seems to have been full of pleasantry) making sport among his
soldiers of the soutar’s greatcoat. Presently they hear disputation and
the sound of blows inside. Out flies the cobbler, his coat flying, the
flaps of his hat beat about his face, and the lieutenant and his
soldiers mock at him as he runs off. They laughed no so hearty the next
time they had occasion to visit the cell and found nobody but a tall,
pretty, grey-eyed lass in the female habit! As for the cobbler, he was
‘over the hills ayout Dumblane,’ and it’s thought that poor Scotland
will have to console herself without him. I drank Catriona’s health
this night in public. Indeed, the whole town admires her; and I think
the beaux would wear bits of her garters in their button-holes if they
could only get them. I would have gone to visit her in prison too, only
I remembered in time I was papa’s daughter; so I wrote her a billet
instead, which I entrusted to the faithful Doig, and I hope you will
admit I can be political when I please. The same faithful gomeral is to
despatch this letter by the express along with those of the wiseacres,
so that you may hear Tom Fool in company with Solomon. Talking of
_gomerals_, do tell _Dauvit Balfour_. I would I could see the face of
him at the thought of a long-legged lass in such a predicament; to say
nothing of the levities of your affectionate daughter, and his
respectful friend.’ So my rascal signs herself!” continued
Prestongrange. “And you see, Mr. David, it is quite true what I tell
you, that my daughters regard you with the most affectionate
playfulness.”

“The gomeral is much obliged,” said I.

“And was not this prettily done!” he went on. “Is not this Highland
maid a piece of a heroine?”

“I was always sure she had a great heart,” said I. “And I wager she
guessed nothing . . . But I beg your pardon, this is to tread upon
forbidden subjects.”

“I will go bail she did not,” he returned, quite openly. “I will go
bail she thought she was flying straight into King George’s face.”

Remembrance of Catriona and the thought of her lying in captivity,
moved me strangely. I could see that even Prestongrange admired, and
could not withhold his lips from smiling when he considered her
behaviour. As for Miss Grant, for all her ill habit of mockery, her
admiration shone out plain. A kind of a heat came on me.

“I am not your lordship’s daughter. . . ” I began.

“That I know of!” he put in, smiling.

“I speak like a fool,” said I; “or rather I began wrong. It would
doubtless be unwise in Mistress Grant to go to her in prison; but for
me, I think I would look like a half-hearted friend if I did not fly
there instantly.”

“So-ho, Mr. David,” says he; “I thought that you and I were in a
bargain?”

“My lord,” I said, “when I made that bargain I was a good deal affected
by your goodness, but I’ll never can deny that I was moved besides by
my own interest. There was self-seeking in my heart, and I think shame
of it now. It may be for your lordship’s safety to say this fashious
Davie Balfour is your friend and housemate. Say it then; I’ll never
contradict you. But as for your patronage, I give it all back. I ask
but the one thing—let me go, and give me a pass to see her in her
prison.”

He looked at me with a hard eye. “You put the cart before the horse, I
think,” says he. “That which I had given was a portion of my liking,
which your thankless nature does not seem to have remarked. But for my
patronage, it is not given, nor (to be exact) is it yet offered.” He
paused a bit. “And I warn you, you do not know yourself,” he added.
“Youth is a hasty season; you will think better of all this before a
year.”

“Well, and I would like to be that kind of youth!” I cried. “I have
seen too much of the other party in these young advocates that fawn
upon your lordship and are even at the pains to fawn on me. And I have
seen it in the old ones also. They are all for by-ends, the whole clan
of them! It’s this that makes me seem to misdoubt your lordship’s
liking. Why would I think that you would like me? But ye told me
yourself ye had an interest!”

I stopped at this, confounded that I had run so far; he was observing
me with an unfathomable face.

“My lord, I ask your pardon,” I resumed. “I have nothing in my chafts
but a rough country tongue. I think it would be only decent-like if I
would go to see my friend in her captivity; but I’m owing you my
life—I’ll never forget that; and if it’s for your lordship’s good, here
I’ll stay. That’s barely gratitude.”

“This might have been reached in fewer words,” says Prestongrange
grimly. “It is easy, and it is at times gracious, to say a plain Scots
‘ay’.”

“Ah, but, my lord, I think ye take me not yet entirely!” cried I. “For
_your_ sake, for my life-safe, and the kindness that ye say ye bear to
me—for these, I’ll consent; but not for any good that might be coming
to myself. If I stand aside when this young maid is in her trial, it’s
a thing I will be noways advantaged by; I will lose by it, I will never
gain. I would rather make a shipwreck wholly than to build on that
foundation.”

He was a minute serious, then smiled. “You mind me of the man with the
long nose,” said he; “was you to see the moon by a telescope you would
see David Balfour there! But you shall have your way of it. I will ask
at you one service, and then set you free: My clerks are overdriven; be
so good as copy me these few pages, and when that is done, I shall bid
you God speed! I would never charge myself with Mr. David’s conscience;
and if you could cast some part of it (as you went by) in a moss hag,
you would find yourself to ride much easier without it.”

“Perhaps not just entirely in the same direction though, my lord!” says
I.

“And you shall have the last word, too!” cries he gaily.

Indeed, he had some cause for gaiety, having now found the means to
gain his purpose. To lessen the weight of the memorial, or to have a
readier answer at his hand, he desired I should appear publicly in the
character of his intimate. But if I were to appear with the same
publicity as a visitor to Catriona in her prison the world would scarce
stint to draw conclusions, and the true nature of James More’s escape
must become evident to all. This was the little problem I had to set
him of a sudden, and to which he had so briskly found an answer. I was
to be tethered in Glasgow by that job of copying, which in mere outward
decency I could not well refuse; and during these hours of employment
Catriona was privately got rid of. I think shame to write of this man
that loaded me with so many goodnesses. He was kind to me as any
father, yet I ever thought him as false as a cracked bell.




CHAPTER XIX.
I AM MUCH IN THE HANDS OF THE LADIES


The copying was a weary business, the more so as I perceived very early
there was no sort of urgency in the matters treated, and began very
early to consider my employment a pretext. I had no sooner finished
than I got to horse, used what remained of daylight to the best
purpose, and being at last fairly benighted, slept in a house by
Almond-Water side. I was in the saddle again before the day, and the
Edinburgh booths were just opening when I clattered in by the West Bow
and drew up a smoking horse at my lord Advocate’s door. I had a written
word for Doig, my lord’s private hand that was thought to be in all his
secrets—a worthy little plain man, all fat and snuff and
self-sufficiency. Him I found already at his desk and already bedabbled
with maccabaw, in the same anteroom where I rencountered with James
More. He read the note scrupulously through like a chapter in his
Bible.

“H’m,” says he; “ye come a wee thing ahint-hand, Mr. Balfour. The
bird’s flaen—we hae letten her out.”

“Miss Drummond is set free?” I cried.

“Achy!” said he. “What would we keep her for, ye ken? To hae made a
steer about the bairn would has pleased naebody.”

“And where’ll she be now?” says I.

“Gude kens!” says Doig, with a shrug.

“She’ll have gone home to Lady Allardyce, I’m thinking,” said I.

“That’ll be it,” said he.

“Then I’ll gang there straight,” says I.

“But ye’ll be for a bite or ye go?” said he.

“Neither bite nor sup,” said I. “I had a good wauch of milk in by
Ratho.”

“Aweel, aweel,” says Doig. “But ye’ll can leave your horse here and
your bags, for it seems we’re to have your up-put.”

“Na, na”, said I. “Tamson’s mear [17] would never be the thing for me
this day of all days.”

Doig speaking somewhat broad, I had been led by imitation into an
accent much more countrified than I was usually careful to affect a
good deal broader, indeed, than I have written it down; and I was the
more ashamed when another voice joined in behind me with a scrap of a
ballad:

“Gae saddle me the bonny black,
Gae saddle sune and mak’ him ready
For I will down the Gatehope-slack,
And a’ to see my bonny leddy.”


The young lady, when I turned to her, stood in a morning gown, and her
hands muffled in the same, as if to hold me at a distance. Yet I could
not but think there was kindness in the eye with which she saw me.

“My best respects to you, Mistress Grant,” said I, bowing.

“The like to yourself, Mr. David,” she replied with a deep courtesy.
“And I beg to remind you of an old musty saw, that meat and mass never
hindered man. The mass I cannot afford you, for we are all good
Protestants. But the meat I press on your attention. And I would not
wonder but I could find something for your private ear that would be
worth the stopping for.”

“Mistress Grant,” said I, “I believe I am already your debtor for some
merry words—and I think they were kind too—on a piece of unsigned
paper.”

“Unsigned paper?” says she, and made a droll face, which was likewise
wondrous beautiful, as of one trying to remember.

“Or else I am the more deceived,” I went on. “But to be sure, we shall
have the time to speak of these, since your father is so good as to
make me for a while your inmate; and the _gomeral_ begs you at this
time only for the favour of his liberty.”

“You give yourself hard names,” said she.

“Mr. Doig and I would be blythe to take harder at your clever pen,”
says I.

“Once more I have to admire the discretion of all men-folk,” she
replied. “But if you will not eat, off with you at once; you will be
back the sooner, for you go on a fool’s errand. Off with you, Mr.
David,” she continued, opening the door.

“He has lowpen on his bonny grey,
He rade the richt gate and the ready
I trow he would neither stint nor stay,
For he was seeking his bonny leddy.”


I did not wait to be twice bidden, and did justice to Miss Grant’s
citation on the way to Dean.

Old Lady Allardyce walked there alone in the garden, in her hat and
mutch, and having a silver-mounted staff of some black wood to lean
upon. As I alighted from my horse, and drew near to her with _congees_,
I could see the blood come in her face, and her head fling into the air
like what I had conceived of empresses.

“What brings you to my poor door?” she cried, speaking high through her
nose. “I cannot bar it. The males of my house are dead and buried; I
have neither son nor husband to stand in the gate for me; any beggar
can pluck me by the baird [18]—and a baird there is, and that’s the
worst of it yet!” she added partly to herself.

I was extremely put out at this reception, and the last remark, which
seemed like a daft wife’s, left me near hand speechless.

“I see I have fallen under your displeasure, ma’am,” said I. “Yet I
will still be so bold as ask after Mistress Drummond.”

She considered me with a burning eye, her lips pressed close together
into twenty creases, her hand shaking on her staff. “This cows all!”
she cried. “Ye come to me to speir for her? Would God I knew!”

“She is not here?” I cried.

She threw up her chin and made a step and a cry at me, so that I fell
back incontinent.

“Out upon your leeing throat!” she cried. “What! ye come and speir at
me! She’s in jyle, whaur ye took her to—that’s all there is to it. And
of a’ the beings ever I beheld in breeks, to think it should be to you!
Ye timmer scoun’rel, if I had a male left to my name I would have your
jaicket dustit till ye raired.”

I thought it not good to delay longer in that place, because I remarked
her passion to be rising. As I turned to the horse-post she even
followed me; and I make no shame to confess that I rode away with the
one stirrup on and scrambling for the other.

As I knew no other quarter where I could push my inquiries, there was
nothing left me but to return to the Advocate’s. I was well received by
the four ladies, who were now in company together, and must give the
news of Prestongrange and what word went in the west country, at the
most inordinate length and with great weariness to myself; while all
the time that young lady, with whom I so much desired to be alone
again, observed me quizzically and seemed to find pleasure in the sight
of my impatience. At last, after I had endured a meal with them, and
was come very near the point of appealing for an interview before her
aunt, she went and stood by the music-case, and picking out a tune,
sang to it on a high key—“He that will not when he may, When he will he
shall have nay.” But this was the end of her rigours, and presently,
after making some excuse of which I have no mind, she carried me away
in private to her father’s library. I should not fail to say she was
dressed to the nines, and appeared extraordinary handsome.

“Now, Mr. David, sit ye down here and let us have a two-handed crack,”
said she. “For I have much to tell you, and it appears besides that I
have been grossly unjust to your good taste.”

“In what manner, Mistress Grant?” I asked. “I trust I have never seemed
to fail in due respect.”

“I will be your surety, Mr. David,” said she. “Your respect, whether to
yourself or your poor neighbours, has been always and most fortunately
beyond imitation. But that is by the question. You got a note from me?”
she asked.

“I was so bold as to suppose so upon inference,” said I, “and it was
kindly thought upon.”

“It must have prodigiously surprised you,” said she. “But let us begin
with the beginning. You have not perhaps forgot a day when you were so
kind as to escort three very tedious misses to Hope Park? I have the
less cause to forget it myself, because you was so particular obliging
as to introduce me to some of the principles of the Latin grammar, a
thing which wrote itself profoundly on my gratitude.”

“I fear I was sadly pedantical,” said I, overcome with confusion at the
memory. “You are only to consider I am quite unused with the society of
ladies.”

“I will say the less about the grammar then,” she replied. “But how
came you to desert your charge? ‘He has thrown her out, overboard, his
ain dear Annie!’” she hummed; “and his ain dear Annie and her two
sisters had to taigle home by theirselves like a string of green geese!
It seems you returned to my papa’s, where you showed yourself
excessively martial, and then on to realms unknown, with an eye (it
appears) to the Bass Rock; solan geese being perhaps more to your mind
than bonny lasses.”

Through all this raillery there was something indulgent in the lady’s
eye which made me suppose there might be better coming.

“You take a pleasure to torment me,” said I, “and I make a very
feckless plaything; but let me ask you to be more merciful. At this
time there is but the one thing that I care to hear of, and that will
be news of Catriona.”

“Do you call her by that name to her face, Mr. Balfour?” she asked.

“In troth, and I am not very sure,” I stammered.

“I would not do so in any case to strangers,” said Miss Grant. “And why
are you so much immersed in the affairs of this young lady?”

“I heard she was in prison,” said I.

“Well, and now you hear that she is out of it,” she replied, “and what
more would you have? She has no need of any further champion.”

“I may have the greater need of her, ma’am,” said I.

“Come, this is better!” says Miss Grant. “But look me fairly in the
face; am I not bonnier than she?”

“I would be the last to be denying it,” said I. “There is not your
marrow in all Scotland.”

“Well, here you have the pick of the two at your hand, and must needs
speak of the other,” said she. “This is never the way to please the
ladies, Mr. Balfour.”

“But, mistress,” said I, “there are surely other things besides mere
beauty.”

“By which I am to understand that I am no better than I should be,
perhaps?” she asked.

“By which you will please understand that I am like the cock in the
midden in the fable book,” said I. “I see the braw jewel—and I like
fine to see it too—but I have more need of the pickle corn.”

“Bravissimo!” she cried. “There is a word well said at last, and I will
reward you for it with my story. That same night of your desertion I
came late from a friend’s house—where I was excessively admired,
whatever you may think of it—and what should I hear but that a lass in
a tartan screen desired to speak with me? She had been there an hour or
better, said the servant-lass, and she grat in to herself as she sat
waiting. I went to her direct; she rose as I came in, and I knew her at
a look. ‘_Grey Eyes_!’ says I to myself, but was more wise than to let
on. _You will be Miss Grant at last_? she says, rising and looking at
me hard and pitiful. _Ay_, _it was true he said_, _you are bonny at all
events_.—_The way God made me_, _my dear_, I said, _but I would be gey
and obliged if you could tell me what brought you here at such a time
of the night_.—_Lady_, she said, _we are kinsfolk_, _we are both come
of the blood of the sons of Alpin_.—_My dear_, I replied, _I think no
more of Alpin or his sons than what I do of a kalestock_. _You have a
better argument in these tears upon your bonny face_. And at that I was
so weak-minded as to kiss her, which is what you would like to do
dearly, and I wager will never find the courage of. I say it was
weak-minded of me, for I knew no more of her than the outside; but it
was the wisest stroke I could have hit upon. She is a very staunch,
brave nature, but I think she has been little used with tenderness; and
at that caress (though to say the truth, it was but lightly given) her
heart went out to me. I will never betray the secrets of my sex, Mr.
Davie; I will never tell you the way she turned me round her thumb,
because it is the same she will use to twist yourself. Ay, it is a fine
lass! She is as clean as hill well water.”

“She is e’en’t!” I cried.

“Well, then, she told me her concerns,” pursued Miss Grant, “and in
what a swither she was in about her papa, and what a taking about
yourself, with very little cause, and in what a perplexity she had
found herself after you was gone away. _And then I minded at long
last_, says she, _that we were kinswomen_, _and that Mr. David should
have given you the name of the bonniest of the bonny_, _and I was
thinking to myself_ ‘_If she is so bonny she will be good at all
events_’; _and I took up my foot soles out of that_. That was when I
forgave yourself, Mr. Davie. When you was in my society, you seemed
upon hot iron: by all marks, if ever I saw a young man that wanted to
be gone, it was yourself, and I and my two sisters were the ladies you
were so desirous to be gone from; and now it appeared you had given me
some notice in the by-going, and was so kind as to comment on my
attractions! From that hour you may date our friendship, and I began to
think with tenderness upon the Latin grammar.”

“You will have many hours to rally me in,” said I; “and I think besides
you do yourself injustice. I think it was Catriona turned your heart in
my direction. She is too simple to perceive as you do the stiffness of
her friend.”

“I would not like to wager upon that, Mr. David,” said she. “The lasses
have clear eyes. But at least she is your friend entirely, as I was to
see. I carried her in to his lordship my papa; and his Advocacy being
in a favourable stage of claret, was so good as to receive the pair of
us. _Here is Grey Eyes that you have been deaved with these days past_,
said I, _she is come to prove that we spoke true_, _and I lay the
prettiest lass in the three Lothians at your feet_—making a papistical
reservation of myself. She suited her action to my words: down she went
upon her knees to him—I would not like to swear but he saw two of her,
which doubtless made her appeal the more irresistible, for you are all
a pack of Mahomedans—told him what had passed that night, and how she
had withheld her father’s man from following of you, and what a case
she was in about her father, and what a flutter for yourself; and
begged with weeping for the lives of both of you (neither of which was
in the slightest danger), till I vow I was proud of my sex because it
was done so pretty, and ashamed for it because of the smallness of the
occasion. She had not gone far, I assure you, before the Advocate was
wholly sober, to see his inmost politics ravelled out by a young lass
and discovered to the most unruly of his daughters. But we took him in
hand, the pair of us, and brought that matter straight. Properly
managed—and that means managed by me—there is no one to compare with my
papa.”

“He has been a good man to me,” said I.

“Well, he was a good man to Katrine, and I was there to see to it,”
said she.

“And she pled for me?” say I.

“She did that, and very movingly,” said Miss Grant. “I would not like
to tell you what she said—I find you vain enough already.”

“God reward her for it!” cried I.

“With Mr. David Balfour, I suppose?” says she.

“You do me too much injustice at the last!” I cried. “I would tremble
to think of her in such hard hands. Do you think I would presume,
because she begged my life? She would do that for a new whelped puppy!
I have had more than that to set me up, if you but ken’d. She kissed
that hand of mine. Ay, but she did. And why? because she thought I was
playing a brave part and might be going to my death. It was not for my
sake—but I need not be telling that to you, that cannot look at me
without laughter. It was for the love of what she thought was bravery.
I believe there is none but me and poor Prince Charlie had that honour
done them. Was this not to make a god of me? and do you not think my
heart would quake when I remember it?”

“I do laugh at you a good deal, and a good deal more than is quite
civil,” said she; “but I will tell you one thing: if you speak to her
like that, you have some glimmerings of a chance.”

“Me?” I cried, “I would never dare. I can speak to you, Miss Grant,
because it’s a matter of indifference what ye think of me. But her? no
fear!” said I.

“I think you have the largest feet in all broad Scotland,” says she.

“Troth they are no very small,” said I, looking down.

“Ah, poor Catriona!” cries Miss Grant.

And I could but stare upon her; for though I now see very well what she
was driving at (and perhaps some justification for the same), I was
never swift at the uptake in such flimsy talk.

“Ah well, Mr. David,” she said, “it goes sore against my conscience,
but I see I shall have to be your speaking board. She shall know you
came to her straight upon the news of her imprisonment; she shall know
you would not pause to eat; and of our conversation she shall hear just
so much as I think convenient for a maid of her age and inexperience.
Believe me, you will be in that way much better served than you could
serve yourself, for I will keep the big feet out of the platter.”

“You know where she is, then?” I exclaimed.

“That I do, Mr. David, and will never tell,” said she.

“Why that?” I asked.

“Well,” she said, “I am a good friend, as you will soon discover; and
the chief of those that I am friend to is my papa. I assure you, you
will never heat nor melt me out of that, so you may spare me your
sheep’s eyes; and adieu to your David-Balfourship for the now.”

“But there is yet one thing more,” I cried. “There is one thing that
must be stopped, being mere ruin to herself, and to me too.”

“Well,” she said, “be brief; I have spent half the day on you already.”

“My Lady Allardyce believes,” I began—“she supposes—she thinks that I
abducted her.”

The colour came into Miss Grant’s face, so that at first I was quite
abashed to find her ear so delicate, till I bethought me she was
struggling rather with mirth, a notion in which I was altogether
confirmed by the shaking of her voice as she replied—

“I will take up the defence of your reputation,” she said. “You may
leave it in my hands.”

And with that she withdrew out of the library.




CHAPTER XX.
I CONTINUE TO MOVE IN GOOD SOCIETY


For about exactly two months I remained a guest in Prestongrange’s
family, where I bettered my acquaintance with the bench, the bar, and
the flower of Edinburgh company. You are not to suppose my education
was neglected; on the contrary, I was kept extremely busy. I studied
the French, so as to be more prepared to go to Leyden; I set myself to
the fencing, and wrought hard, sometimes three hours in the day, with
notable advancement; at the suggestion of my cousin, Pilrig, who was an
apt musician, I was put to a singing class; and by the orders of my
Miss Grant, to one for the dancing, at which I must say I proved far
from ornamental. However, all were good enough to say it gave me an
address a little more genteel; and there is no question but I learned
to manage my coat skirts and sword with more dexterity, and to stand in
a room as though the same belonged to me. My clothes themselves were
all earnestly re-ordered; and the most trifling circumstance, such as
where I should tie my hair, or the colour of my ribbon, debated among
the three misses like a thing of weight. One way with another, no doubt
I was a good deal improved to look at, and acquired a bit of modest air
that would have surprised the good folks at Essendean.

The two younger misses were very willing to discuss a point of my
habiliment, because that was in the line of their chief thoughts. I
cannot say that they appeared any other way conscious of my presence;
and though always more than civil, with a kind of heartless cordiality,
could not hide how much I wearied them. As for the aunt, she was a
wonderful still woman; and I think she gave me much the same attention
as she gave the rest of the family, which was little enough. The eldest
daughter and the Advocate himself were thus my principal friends, and
our familiarity was much increased by a pleasure that we took in
common. Before the court met we spent a day or two at the house of
Grange, living very nobly with an open table, and here it was that we
three began to ride out together in the fields, a practice afterwards
maintained in Edinburgh, so far as the Advocate’s continual affairs
permitted. When we were put in a good frame by the briskness of the
exercise, the difficulties of the way, or the accidents of bad weather,
my shyness wore entirely off; we forgot that we were strangers, and
speech not being required, it flowed the more naturally on. Then it was
that they had my story from me, bit by bit, from the time that I left
Essendean, with my voyage and battle in the _Covenant_, wanderings in
the heather, etc.; and from the interest they found in my adventures
sprung the circumstance of a jaunt we made a little later on, on a day
when the courts were not sitting, and of which I will tell a trifle
more at length.

We took horse early, and passed first by the house of Shaws, where it
stood smokeless in a great field of white frost, for it was yet early
in the day. Here Prestongrange alighted down, gave me his horse, an
proceeded alone to visit my uncle. My heart, I remember, swelled up
bitter within me at the sight of that bare house and the thought of the
old miser sitting chittering within in the cold kitchen!

“There is my home,” said I; “and my family.”

“Poor David Balfour!” said Miss Grant.

What passed during the visit I have never heard; but it would doubtless
not be very agreeable to Ebenezer, for when the Advocate came forth
again his face was dark.

“I think you will soon be the laird indeed, Mr. Davie,” says he,
turning half about with the one foot in the stirrup.

“I will never pretend sorrow,” said I; and, to say the truth, during
his absence Miss Grant and I had been embellishing the place in fancy
with plantations, parterres, and a terrace—much as I have since carried
out in fact.

Thence we pushed to the Queensferry, where Rankeillor gave us a good
welcome, being indeed out of the body to receive so great a visitor.
Here the Advocate was so unaffectedly good as to go quite fully over my
affairs, sitting perhaps two hours with the Writer in his study, and
expressing (I was told) a great esteem for myself and concern for my
fortunes. To while this time, Miss Grant and I and young Rankeillor
took boat and passed the Hope to Limekilns. Rankeillor made himself
very ridiculous (and, I thought, offensive) with his admiration for the
young lady, and to my wonder (only it is so common a weakness of her
sex) she seemed, if anything, to be a little gratified. One use it had:
for when we were come to the other side, she laid her commands on him
to mind the boat, while she and I passed a little further to the
alehouse. This was her own thought, for she had been taken with my
account of Alison Hastie, and desired to see the lass herself. We found
her once more alone—indeed, I believe her father wrought all day in the
fields—and she curtsied dutifully to the gentry-folk and the beautiful
young lady in the riding-coat.

“Is this all the welcome I am to get?” said I, holding out my hand.
“And have you no more memory of old friends?”

“Keep me! wha’s this of it?” she cried, and then, “God’s truth, it’s
the tautit [19] laddie!”

“The very same,” says I.

“Mony’s the time I’ve thocht upon you and your freen, and blythe am I
to see in your braws,” [20] she cried. “Though I kent ye were come to
your ain folk by the grand present that ye sent me and that I thank ye
for with a’ my heart.”

“There,” said Miss Grant to me, “run out by with ye, like a guid bairn.
I didnae come here to stand and haud a candle; it’s her and me that are
to crack.”

I suppose she stayed ten minutes in the house, but when she came forth
I observed two things—that her eyes were reddened, and a silver brooch
was gone out of her bosom. This very much affected me.

“I never saw you so well adorned,” said I.

“O Davie man, dinna be a pompous gowk!” said she, and was more than
usually sharp to me the remainder of the day.

About candlelight we came home from this excursion.

For a good while I heard nothing further of Catriona—my Miss Grant
remaining quite impenetrable, and stopping my mouth with pleasantries.
At last, one day that she returned from walking and found me alone in
the parlour over my French, I thought there was something unusual in
her looks; the colour heightened, the eyes sparkling high, and a bit of
a smile continually bitten in as she regarded me. She seemed indeed
like the very spirit of mischief, and, walking briskly in the room, had
soon involved me in a kind of quarrel over nothing and (at the least)
with nothing intended on my side. I was like Christian in the
slough—the more I tried to clamber out upon the side, the deeper I
became involved; until at last I heard her declare, with a great deal
of passion, that she would take that answer from the hands of none, and
I must down upon my knees for pardon.

The causelessness of all this fuff stirred my own bile. “I have said
nothing you can properly object to,” said I, “and as for my knees, that
is an attitude I keep for God.”

“And as a goddess I am to be served!” she cried, shaking her brown
locks at me and with a bright colour. “Every man that comes within waft
of my petticoats shall use me so!”

“I will go so far as ask your pardon for the fashion’s sake, although I
vow I know not why,” I replied. “But for these play-acting postures,
you can go to others.”

“O Davie!” she said. “Not if I was to beg you?”

I bethought me I was fighting with a woman, which is the same as to say
a child, and that upon a point entirely formal.

“I think it a bairnly thing,” I said, “not worthy in you to ask, or me
to render. Yet I will not refuse you, neither,” said I; “and the stain,
if there be any, rests with yourself.” And at that I kneeled fairly
down.

“There!” she cried. “There is the proper station, there is where I have
been manoeuvring to bring you.” And then, suddenly, “Kep,” [21] said
she, flung me a folded billet, and ran from the apartment laughing.

The billet had neither place nor date. “Dear Mr. David,” it began, “I
get your news continually by my cousin, Miss Grant, and it is a
pleisand hearing. I am very well, in a good place, among good folk, but
necessitated to be quite private, though I am hoping that at long last
we may meet again. All your friendships have been told me by my loving
cousin, who loves us both. She bids me to send you this writing, and
oversees the same. I will be asking you to do all her commands, and
rest your affectionate friend, Catriona Macgregor-Drummond. P.S.—Will
you not see my cousin, Allardyce?”

I think it not the least brave of my campaigns (as the soldiers say)
that I should have done as I was here bidden and gone forthright to the
house by Dean. But the old lady was now entirely changed and supple as
a glove. By what means Miss Grant had brought this round I could never
guess; I am sure, at least, she dared not to appear openly in the
affair, for her papa was compromised in it pretty deep. It was he,
indeed, who had persuaded Catriona to leave, or rather, not to return,
to her cousin’s, placing her instead with a family of Gregorys—decent
people, quite at the Advocate’s disposition, and in whom she might have
the more confidence because they were of his own clan and family. These
kept her private till all was ripe, heated and helped her to attempt
her father’s rescue, and after she was discharged from prison received
her again into the same secrecy. Thus Prestongrange obtained and used
his instrument; nor did there leak out the smallest word of his
acquaintance with the daughter of James More. There was some
whispering, of course, upon the escape of that discredited person; but
the Government replied by a show of rigour, one of the cell porters was
flogged, the lieutenant of the guard (my poor friend, Duncansby) was
broken of his rank, and as for Catriona, all men were well enough
pleased that her fault should be passed by in silence.

I could never induce Miss Grant to carry back an answer. “No,” she
would say, when I persisted, “I am going to keep the big feet out of
the platter.” This was the more hard to bear, as I was aware she saw my
little friend many times in the week, and carried her my news whenever
(as she said) I “had behaved myself.” At last she treated me to what
she called an indulgence, and I thought rather more of a banter. She
was certainly a strong, almost a violent, friend to all she liked,
chief among whom was a certain frail old gentlewoman, very blind and
very witty, who dwelt on the top of a tall land on a strait close, with
a nest of linnets in a cage, and thronged all day with visitors. Miss
Grant was very fond to carry me there and put me to entertain her
friend with the narrative of my misfortunes: and Miss Tibbie Ramsay
(that was her name) was particular kind, and told me a great deal that
was worth knowledge of old folks and past affairs in Scotland. I should
say that from her chamber window, and not three feet away, such is the
straitness of that close, it was possible to look into a barred
loophole lighting the stairway of the opposite house.

Here, upon some pretext, Miss Grant left me one day alone with Miss
Ramsay. I mind I thought that lady inattentive and like one
preoccupied. I was besides very uncomfortable, for the window, contrary
to custom, was left open and the day was cold. All at once the voice of
Miss Grant sounded in my ears as from a distance.

“Here, Shaws!” she cried, “keek out of the window and see what I have
broughten you.”

I think it was the prettiest sight that ever I beheld. The well of the
close was all in clear shadow where a man could see distinctly, the
walls very black and dingy; and there from the barred loophole I saw
two faces smiling across at me—Miss Grant’s and Catriona’s.

“There!” says Miss Grant, “I wanted her to see you in your braws like
the lass of Limekilns. I wanted her to see what I could make of you,
when I buckled to the job in earnest!”

It came in my mind that she had been more than common particular that
day upon my dress; and I think that some of the same care had been
bestowed upon Catriona. For so merry and sensible a lady, Miss Grant
was certainly wonderful taken up with duds.

“Catriona!” was all I could get out.

As for her, she said nothing in the world, but only waved her hand and
smiled to me, and was suddenly carried away again from before the
loophole.

That vision was no sooner lost than I ran to the house door, where I
found I was locked in; thence back to Miss Ramsay, crying for the key,
but might as well have cried upon the castle rock. She had passed her
word, she said, and I must be a good lad. It was impossible to burst
the door, even if it had been mannerly; it was impossible I should leap
from the window, being seven storeys above ground. All I could do was
to crane over the close and watch for their reappearance from the
stair. It was little to see, being no more than the tops of their two
heads each on a ridiculous bobbin of skirts, like to a pair of
pincushions. Nor did Catriona so much as look up for a farewell; being
prevented (as I heard afterwards) by Miss Grant, who told her folk were
never seen to less advantage than from above downward.

On the way home, as soon as I was set free, I upbraided Miss Grant with
her cruelty.

“I am sorry you was disappointed,” says she demurely. “For my part I
was very pleased. You looked better than I dreaded; you looked—if it
will not make you vain—a mighty pretty young man when you appeared in
the window. You are to remember that she could not see your feet,” says
she, with the manner of one reassuring me.

“O!” cried I, “leave my feet be—they are no bigger than my
neighbours’.”

“They are even smaller than some,” said she, “but I speak in parables
like a Hebrew prophet.”

“I marvel little they were sometimes stoned!” says I. “But, you
miserable girl, how could you do it? Why should you care to tantalise
me with a moment?”

“Love is like folk,” says she; “it needs some kind of vivers.” [22]

“Oh, Barbara, let me see her properly!” I pleaded. “_You_ can—you see
her when you please; let me have half an hour.”

“Who is it that is managing this love affair! You! Or me?” she asked,
and as I continued to press her with my instances, fell back upon a
deadly expedient: that of imitating the tones of my voice when I called
on Catriona by name; with which, indeed, she held me in subjection for
some days to follow.

There was never the least word heard of the memorial, or none by me.
Prestongrange and his grace the Lord President may have heard of it
(for what I know) on the deafest sides of their heads; they kept it to
themselves, at least—the public was none the wiser; and in course of
time, on November 8th, and in the midst of a prodigious storm of wind
and rain, poor James of the Glens was duly hanged at Lettermore by
Ballachulish.

So there was the final upshot of my politics! Innocent men have
perished before James, and are like to keep on perishing (in spite of
all our wisdom) till the end of time. And till the end of time young
folk (who are not yet used with the duplicity of life and men) will
struggle as I did, and make heroical resolves, and take long risks; and
the course of events will push them upon the one side and go on like a
marching army. James was hanged; and here was I dwelling in the house
of Prestongrange, and grateful to him for his fatherly attention. He
was hanged; and behold! when I met Mr. Simon in the causeway, I was
fain to pull off my beaver to him like a good little boy before his
dominie. He had been hanged by fraud and violence, and the world wagged
along, and there was not a pennyweight of difference; and the villains
of that horrid plot were decent, kind, respectable fathers of families,
who went to kirk and took the sacrament!

But I had had my view of that detestable business they call politics—I
had seen it from behind, when it is all bones and blackness; and I was
cured for life of any temptations to take part in it again. A plain,
quiet, private path was that which I was ambitious to walk in, when I
might keep my head out of the way of dangers and my conscience out of
the road of temptation. For, upon a retrospect, it appeared I had not
done so grandly, after all; but with the greatest possible amount of
big speech and preparation, had accomplished nothing.

The 25th of the same month a ship was advertised to sail from Leith;
and I was suddenly recommended to make up my mails for Leyden. To
Prestongrange I could, of course, say nothing; for I had already been a
long while sorning on his house and table. But with his daughter I was
more open, bewailing my fate that I should be sent out of the country,
and assuring her, unless she should bring me to farewell with Catriona,
I would refuse at the last hour.

“Have I not given you my advice?” she asked.

“I know you have,” said I, “and I know how much I am beholden to you
already, and that I am bidden to obey your orders. But you must confess
you are something too merry a lass at times to lippen [23] to
entirely.”

“I will tell you, then,” said she. “Be you on board by nine o’clock
forenoon; the ship does not sail before one; keep your boat alongside;
and if you are not pleased with my farewells when I shall send them,
you can come ashore again and seek Katrine for yourself.”

Since I could make no more of her, I was fain to be content with this.

The day came round at last when she and I were to separate. We had been
extremely intimate and familiar; I was much in her debt; and what way
we were to part was a thing that put me from my sleep, like the vails I
was to give to the domestic servants. I knew she considered me too
backward, and rather desired to rise in her opinion on that head.
Besides which, after so much affection shown and (I believe) felt upon
both sides, it would have looked cold-like to be anyways stiff.
Accordingly, I got my courage up and my words ready, and the last
chance we were like to be alone, asked pretty boldly to be allowed to
salute her in farewell.

“You forget yourself strangely, Mr. Balfour,” said she. “I cannot call
to mind that I have given you any right to presume on our
acquaintancy.”

I stood before her like a stopped clock, and knew not what to think,
far less to say, when of a sudden she cast her arms about my neck and
kissed me with the best will in the world.

“You inimitable bairn!” she cried. “Did you think that I would let us
part like strangers? Because I can never keep my gravity at you five
minutes on end, you must not dream I do not love you very well: I am
all love and laughter, every time I cast an eye on you! And now I will
give you an advice to conclude your education, which you will have need
of before it’s very long. Never _ask_ womenfolk. They’re bound to
answer ‘No’; God never made the lass that could resist the temptation.
It’s supposed by divines to be the curse of Eve: because she did not
say it when the devil offered her the apple, her daughters can say
nothing else.”

“Since I am so soon to lose my bonny professor,” I began.

“This is gallant, indeed,” says she curtseying.

“I would put the one question,” I went on. “May I ask a lass to marry
to me?”

“You think you could not marry her without!” she asked. “Or else get
her to offer?”

“You see you cannot be serious,” said I.

“I shall be very serious in one thing, David,” said she: “I shall
always be your friend.”

As I got to my horse the next morning, the four ladies were all at that
same window whence we had once looked down on Catriona, and all cried
farewell and waved their pocket napkins as I rode away. One out of the
four I knew was truly sorry; and at the thought of that, and how I had
come to the door three months ago for the first time, sorrow and
gratitude made a confusion in my mind.

FATHER AND DAUGHTER




CHAPTER XXI.
THE VOYAGE INTO HOLLAND


The ship lay at a single anchor, well outside the pier of Leith, so
that all we passengers must come to it by the means of skiffs. This was
very little troublesome, for the reason that the day was a flat calm,
very frosty and cloudy, and with a low shifting fog upon the water. The
body of the vessel was thus quite hid as I drew near, but the tall
spars of her stood high and bright in a sunshine like the flickering of
a fire. She proved to be a very roomy, commodious merchant, but
somewhat blunt in the bows, and loaden extraordinary deep with salt,
salted salmon, and fine white linen stockings for the Dutch. Upon my
coming on board, the captain welcomed me—one Sang (out of Lesmahago, I
believe), a very hearty, friendly tarpaulin of a man, but at the moment
in rather of a bustle. There had no other of the passengers yet
appeared, so that I was left to walk about upon the deck, viewing the
prospect and wondering a good deal what these farewells should be which
I was promised.

All Edinburgh and the Pentland Hills glinted above me in a kind of
smuisty brightness, now and again overcome with blots of cloud; of
Leith there was no more than the tops of chimneys visible, and on the
face of the water, where the haar [24] lay, nothing at all. Out of this
I was presently aware of a sound of oars pulling, and a little after
(as if out of the smoke of a fire) a boat issued. There sat a grave man
in the stern sheets, well muffled from the cold, and by his side a
tall, pretty, tender figure of a maid that brought my heart to a stand.
I had scarce the time to catch my breath in, and be ready to meet her,
as she stepped upon the deck, smiling, and making my best bow, which
was now vastly finer than some months before, when first I made it to
her ladyship. No doubt we were both a good deal changed: she seemed to
have shot up like a young, comely tree. She had now a kind of pretty
backwardness that became her well as of one that regarded herself more
highly and was fairly woman; and for another thing, the hand of the
same magician had been at work upon the pair of us, and Miss Grant had
made us both _braw_, if she could make but the one _bonny_.

The same cry, in words not very different, came from both of us, that
the other was come in compliment to say farewell, and then we perceived
in a flash we were to ship together.

“O, why will not Baby have been telling me!” she cried; and then
remembered a letter she had been given, on the condition of not opening
it till she was well on board. Within was an enclosure for myself, and
ran thus:

“Dear Davie,—What do you think of my farewell? and what do you say to
your fellow passenger? Did you kiss, or did you ask? I was about to
have signed here, but that would leave the purport of my question
doubtful, and in my own case _I ken the answer_. So fill up here with
good advice. Do not be too blate, [25] and for God’s sake do not try to
be too forward; nothing acts you worse. I am


“Your affectionate friend and governess,
“Barbara Grant.”


I wrote a word of answer and compliment on a leaf out of my pocketbook,
put it in with another scratch from Catriona, sealed the whole with my
new signet of the Balfour arms, and despatched it by the hand of
Prestongrange’s servant that still waited in my boat.

Then we had time to look upon each other more at leisure, which we had
not done for a piece of a minute before (upon a common impulse) we
shook hands again.

“Catriona?” said I. It seemed that was the first and last word of my
eloquence.

“You will be glad to see me again?” says she.

“And I think that is an idle word,” said I. “We are too deep friends to
make speech upon such trifles.”

“Is she not the girl of all the world?” she cried again. “I was never
knowing such a girl so honest and so beautiful.”

“And yet she cared no more for Alpin than what she did for a
kale-stock,” said I.

“Ah, she will say so indeed!” cries Catriona. “Yet it was for the name
and the gentle kind blood that she took me up and was so good to me.”

“Well, I will tell you why it was,” said I. “There are all sorts of
people’s faces in this world. There is Barbara’s face, that everyone
must look at and admire, and think her a fine, brave, merry girl. And
then there is your face, which is quite different—I never knew how
different till to-day. You cannot see yourself, and that is why you do
not understand; but it was for the love of your face that she took you
up and was so good to you. And everybody in the world would do the
same.”

“Everybody?” says she.

“Every living soul!” said I.

“Ah, then, that will be why the soldiers at the castle took me up!” she
cried.

“Barbara has been teaching you to catch me,” said I.

“She will have taught me more than that at all events. She will have
taught me a great deal about Mr. David—all the ill of him, and a little
that was not so ill either, now and then,” she said, smiling. “She will
have told me all there was of Mr. David, only just that he would sail
upon this very same ship. And why it is you go?”

I told her.

“Ah, well,” said she, “we will be some days in company and then (I
suppose) good-bye for altogether! I go to meet my father at a place of
the name of Helvoetsluys, and from there to France, to be exiles by the
side of our chieftain.”

I could say no more than just “O!” the name of James More always drying
up my very voice.

She was quick to perceive it, and to guess some portion of my thought.

“There is one thing I must be saying first of all, Mr. David,” said
she. “I think two of my kinsfolk have not behaved to you altogether
very well. And the one of them two is James More, my father, and the
other is the Laird of Prestongrange. Prestongrange will have spoken by
himself, or his daughter in the place of him. But for James More, my
father, I have this much to say: he lay shackled in a prison; he is a
plain honest soldier and a plain Highland gentleman; what they would be
after he would never be guessing; but if he had understood it was to be
some prejudice to a young gentleman like yourself, he would have died
first. And for the sake of all your friendships, I will be asking you
to pardon my father and family for that same mistake.”

“Catriona,” said I, “what that mistake was I do not care to know. I
know but the one thing—that you went to Prestongrange and begged my
life upon your knees. O, I ken well enough it was for your father that
you went, but when you were there you pleaded for me also. It is a
thing I cannot speak of. There are two things I cannot think of into
myself: and the one is your good words when you called yourself my
little friend, and the other that you pleaded for my life. Let us never
speak more, we two, of pardon or offence.”

We stood after that silent, Catriona looking on the deck and I on her;
and before there was more speech, a little wind having sprung up in the
nor’-west, they began to shake out the sails and heave in upon the
anchor.

There were six passengers besides our two selves, which made of it a
full cabin. Three were solid merchants out of Leith, Kirkcaldy, and
Dundee, all engaged in the same adventure into High Germany. One was a
Hollander returning; the rest worthy merchants’ wives, to the charge of
one of whom Catriona was recommended. Mrs. Gebbie (for that was her
name) was by great good fortune heavily incommoded by the sea, and lay
day and night on the broad of her back. We were besides the only
creatures at all young on board the _Rose_, except a white-faced boy
that did my old duty to attend upon the table; and it came about that
Catriona and I were left almost entirely to ourselves. We had the next
seats together at the table, where I waited on her with extraordinary
pleasure. On deck, I made her a soft place with my cloak; and the
weather being singularly fine for that season, with bright frosty days
and nights, a steady, gentle wind, and scarce a sheet started all the
way through the North Sea, we sat there (only now and again walking to
and fro for warmth) from the first blink of the sun till eight or nine
at night under the clear stars. The merchants or Captain Sang would
sometimes glance and smile upon us, or pass a merry word or two and
give us the go-by again; but the most part of the time they were deep
in herring and chintzes and linen, or in computations of the slowness
of the passage, and left us to our own concerns, which were very little
important to any but ourselves.

At the first, we had a great deal to say, and thought ourselves pretty
witty; and I was at a little pains to be the _beau_, and she (I
believe) to play the young lady of experience. But soon we grew plainer
with each other. I laid aside my high, clipped English (what little
there was left of it) and forgot to make my Edinburgh bows and scrapes;
she, upon her side, fell into a sort of kind familiarity; and we dwelt
together like those of the same household, only (upon my side) with a
more deep emotion. About the same time the bottom seemed to fall out of
our conversation, and neither one of us the less pleased. Whiles she
would tell me old wives’ tales, of which she had a wonderful variety,
many of them from my friend red-headed Niel. She told them very pretty,
and they were pretty enough childish tales; but the pleasure to myself
was in the sound of her voice, and the thought that she was telling and
I listening. Whiles, again, we would sit entirely silent, not
communicating even with a look, and tasting pleasure enough in the
sweetness of that neighbourhood. I speak here only for myself. Of what
was in the maid’s mind, I am not very sure that ever I asked myself;
and what was in my own, I was afraid to consider. I need make no secret
of it now, either to myself or to the reader; I was fallen totally in
love. She came between me and the sun. She had grown suddenly taller,
as I say, but with a wholesome growth; she seemed all health, and
lightness, and brave spirits; and I thought she walked like a young
deer, and stood like a birch upon the mountains. It was enough for me
to sit near by her on the deck; and I declare I scarce spent two
thoughts upon the future, and was so well content with what I then
enjoyed that I was never at the pains to imagine any further step;
unless perhaps that I would be sometimes tempted to take her hand in
mine and hold it there. But I was too like a miser of what joys I had,
and would venture nothing on a hazard.

What we spoke was usually of ourselves or of each other, so that if
anyone had been at so much pains as overhear us, he must have supposed
us the most egotistical persons in the world. It befell one day when we
were at this practice, that we came on a discourse of friends and
friendship, and I think now that we were sailing near the wind. We said
what a fine thing friendship was, and how little we had guessed of it,
and how it made life a new thing, and a thousand covered things of the
same kind that will have been said, since the foundation of the world,
by young folk in the same predicament. Then we remarked upon the
strangeness of that circumstance, that friends came together in the
beginning as if they were there for the first time, and yet each had
been alive a good while, losing time with other people.

“It is not much that I have done,” said she, “and I could be telling
you the five-fifths of it in two-three words. It is only a girl I am,
and what can befall a girl, at all events? But I went with the clan in
the year ’45. The men marched with swords and fire-locks, and some of
them in brigades in the same set of tartan; they were not backward at
the marching, I can tell you. And there were gentlemen from the Low
Country, with their tenants mounted and trumpets to sound, and there
was a grand skirling of war-pipes. I rode on a little Highland horse on
the right hand of my father, James More, and of Glengyle himself. And
here is one fine thing that I remember, that Glengyle kissed me in the
face, because (says he) ‘my kinswoman, you are the only lady of the
clan that has come out,’ and me a little maid of maybe twelve years
old! I saw Prince Charlie too, and the blue eyes of him; he was pretty
indeed! I had his hand to kiss in front of the army. O, well, these
were the good days, but it is all like a dream that I have seen and
then awakened. It went what way you very well know; and these were the
worst days of all, when the red-coat soldiers were out, and my father
and uncles lay in the hill, and I was to be carrying them their meat in
the middle night, or at the short sight of day when the cocks crow.
Yes, I have walked in the night, many’s the time, and my heart great in
me for terror of the darkness. It is a strange thing I will never have
been meddled with by a bogle; but they say a maid goes safe. Next there
was my uncle’s marriage, and that was a dreadful affair beyond all.
Jean Kay was that woman’s name; and she had me in the room with her
that night at Inversnaid, the night we took her from her friends in the
old, ancient manner. She would and she wouldn’t; she was for marrying
Rob the one minute, and the next she would be for none of him. I will
never have seen such a feckless creature of a woman; surely all there
was of her would tell her ay or no. Well, she was a widow; and I can
never be thinking a widow a good woman.”

“Catriona!” says I, “how do you make out that?”

“I do not know,” said she; “I am only telling you the seeming in my
heart. And then to marry a new man! Fy! But that was her; and she was
married again upon my Uncle Robin, and went with him awhile to kirk and
market; and then wearied, or else her friends got claught of her and
talked her round, or maybe she turned ashamed; at the least of it, she
ran away, and went back to her own folk, and said we had held her in
the lake, and I will never tell you all what. I have never thought much
of any females since that day. And so in the end my father, James More,
came to be cast in prison, and you know the rest of it an well as me.”

“And through all you had no friends?” said I.

“No,” said she; “I have been pretty chief with two-three lasses on the
braes, but not to call it friends.”

“Well, mine is a plain tale,” said I. “I never had a friend to my name
till I met in with you.”

“And that brave Mr. Stewart?” she asked.

“O, yes, I was forgetting him,” I said. “But he is a man, and that is
very different.”

“I would think so,” said she. “O, yes, it is quite different.”

“And then there was one other,” said I. “I once thought I had a friend,
but it proved a disappointment.”

She asked me who she was?

“It was a he, then,” said I. “We were the two best lads at my father’s
school, and we thought we loved each other dearly. Well, the time came
when he went to Glasgow to a merchant’s house, that was his second
cousin once removed; and wrote me two-three times by the carrier; and
then he found new friends, and I might write till I was tired, he took
no notice. Eh, Catriona, it took me a long while to forgive the world.
There is not anything more bitter than to lose a fancied friend.”

Then she began to question me close upon his looks and character, for
we were each a great deal concerned in all that touched the other; till
at last, in a very evil hour, I minded of his letters and went and
fetched the bundle from the cabin.

“Here are his letters,” said I, “and all the letters that ever I got.
That will be the last I’ll can tell of myself; ye know the lave [26] as
well as I do.”

“Will you let me read them, then?” says she.

I told her, _if she would be at the pains_; and she bade me go away and
she would read them from the one end to the other. Now, in this bundle
that I gave her, there were packed together not only all the letters of
my false friend, but one or two of Mr. Campbell’s when he was in town
at the Assembly, and to make a complete roll of all that ever was
written to me, Catriona’s little word, and the two I had received from
Miss Grant, one when I was on the Bass and one on board that ship. But
of these last I had no particular mind at the moment.

I was in that state of subjection to the thought of my friend that it
mattered not what I did, nor scarce whether I was in her presence or
out of it; I had caught her like some kind of a noble fever that lived
continually in my bosom, by night and by day, and whether I was waking
or asleep. So it befell that after I was come into the fore-part of the
ship where the broad bows splashed into the billows, I was in no such
hurry to return as you might fancy; rather prolonged my absence like a
variety in pleasure. I do not think I am by nature much of an
Epicurean: and there had come till then so small a share of pleasure in
my way that I might be excused perhaps to dwell on it unduly.

When I returned to her again, I had a faint, painful impression as of a
buckle slipped, so coldly she returned the packet.

“You have read them?” said I; and I thought my voice sounded not wholly
natural, for I was turning in my mind for what could ail her.

“Did you mean me to read all?” she asked.

I told her “Yes,” with a drooping voice.

“The last of them as well?” said she.

I knew where we were now; yet I would not lie to her either. “I gave
them all without afterthought,” I said, “as I supposed that you would
read them. I see no harm in any.”

“I will be differently made,” said she. “I thank God I am differently
made. It was not a fit letter to be shown me. It was not fit to be
written.”

“I think you are speaking of your own friend, Barbara Grant?” said I.

“There will not be anything as bitter as to lose a fancied friend,”
said she, quoting my own expression.

“I think it is sometimes the friendship that was fancied!” I cried.
“What kind of justice do you call this, to blame me for some words that
a tomfool of a madcap lass has written down upon a piece of paper? You
know yourself with what respect I have behaved—and would do always.”

“Yet you would show me that same letter!” says she. “I want no such
friends. I can be doing very well, Mr. Balfour, without her—or you.”

“This is your fine gratitude!” says I.

“I am very much obliged to you,” said she. “I will be asking you to
take away your—letters.” She seemed to choke upon the word, so that it
sounded like an oath.

“You shall never ask twice,” said I; picked up that bundle, walked a
little way forward and cast them as far as possible into the sea. For a
very little more I could have cast myself after them.

The rest of the day I walked up and down raging. There were few names
so ill but what I gave her them in my own mind before the sun went
down. All that I had ever heard of Highland pride seemed quite outdone;
that a girl (scarce grown) should resent so trifling an allusion, and
that from her next friend, that she had near wearied me with praising
of! I had bitter, sharp, hard thoughts of her, like an angry boy’s. If
I had kissed her indeed (I thought), perhaps she would have taken it
pretty well; and only because it had been written down, and with a
spice of jocularity, up she must fuff in this ridiculous passion. It
seemed to me there was a want of penetration in the female sex, to make
angels weep over the case of the poor men.

We were side by side again at supper, and what a change was there! She
was like curdled milk to me; her face was like a wooden doll’s; I could
have indifferently smitten her or grovelled at her feet, but she gave
me not the least occasion to do either. No sooner the meal done than
she betook herself to attend on Mrs. Gebbie, which I think she had a
little neglected heretofore. But she was to make up for lost time, and
in what remained of the passage was extraordinary assiduous with the
old lady, and on deck began to make a great deal more than I thought
wise of Captain Sang. Not but what the Captain seemed a worthy,
fatherly man; but I hated to behold her in the least familiarity with
anyone except myself.

Altogether, she was so quick to avoid me, and so constant to keep
herself surrounded with others, that I must watch a long while before I
could find my opportunity; and after it was found, I made not much of
it, as you are now to hear.

“I have no guess how I have offended,” said I; “it should scarce be
beyond pardon, then. O, try if you can pardon me.”

“I have no pardon to give,” said she; and the words seemed to come out
of her throat like marbles. “I will be very much obliged for all your
friendships.” And she made me an eighth part of a curtsey.

But I had schooled myself beforehand to say more, and I was going to
say it too.

“There is one thing,” said I. “If I have shocked your particularity by
the showing of that letter, it cannot touch Miss Grant. She wrote not
to you, but to a poor, common, ordinary lad, who might have had more
sense than show it. If you are to blame me—”

“I will advise you to say no more about that girl, at all events!” said
Catriona. “It is her I will never look the road of, not if she lay
dying.” She turned away from me, and suddenly back. “Will you swear you
will have no more to deal with her?” she cried.

“Indeed, and I will never be so unjust then,” said I; “nor yet so
ungrateful.”

And now it was I that turned away.




CHAPTER XXII.
HELVOETSLUYS


The weather in the end considerably worsened; the wind sang in the
shrouds, the sea swelled higher, and the ship began to labour and cry
out among the billows. The song of the leadsman in the chains was now
scarce ceasing, for we thrid all the way among shoals. About nine in
the morning, in a burst of wintry sun between two squalls of hail, I
had my first look of Holland—a line of windmills birling in the breeze.
It was besides my first knowledge of these daft-like contrivances,
which gave me a near sense of foreign travel and a new world and life.
We came to an anchor about half-past eleven, outside the harbour of
Helvoetsluys, in a place where the sea sometimes broke and the ship
pitched outrageously. You may be sure we were all on deck save Mrs.
Gebbie, some of us in cloaks, others mantled in the ship’s tarpaulins,
all clinging on by ropes, and jesting the most like old sailor-folk
that we could imitate.

Presently a boat, that was backed like a partancrab, came gingerly
alongside, and the skipper of it hailed our master in the Dutch. Thence
Captain Sang turned, very troubled-like, to Catriona; and the rest of
us crowding about, the nature of the difficulty was made plain to all.
The _Rose_ was bound to the port of Rotterdam, whither the other
passengers were in a great impatience to arrive, in view of a
conveyance due to leave that very evening in the direction of the Upper
Germany. This, with the present half-gale of wind, the captain (if no
time were lost) declared himself still capable to save. Now James More
had trysted in Helvoet with his daughter, and the captain had engaged
to call before the port and place her (according to the custom) in a
shore boat. There was the boat, to be sure, and here was Catriona
ready: but both our master and the patroon of the boat scrupled at the
risk, and the first was in no humour to delay.

“Your father,” said he, “would be gey an little pleased if we was to
break a leg to ye, Miss Drummond, let-a-be drowning of you. Take my way
of it,” says he, “and come on-by with the rest of us here to Rotterdam.
Ye can get a passage down the Maes in a sailing scoot as far as to the
Brill, and thence on again, by a place in a rattel-waggon, back to
Helvoet.”

But Catriona would hear of no change. She looked white-like as she
beheld the bursting of the sprays, the green seas that sometimes poured
upon the fore-castle, and the perpetual bounding and swooping of the
boat among the billows; but she stood firmly by her father’s orders.
“My father, James More, will have arranged it so,” was her first word
and her last. I thought it very idle and indeed wanton in the girl to
be so literal and stand opposite to so much kind advice; but the fact
is she had a very good reason, if she would have told us. Sailing
scoots and rattel-waggons are excellent things; only the use of them
must first be paid for, and all she was possessed of in the world was
just two shillings and a penny halfpenny sterling. So it fell out that
captain and passengers, not knowing of her destitution—and she being
too proud to tell them—spoke in vain.

“But you ken nae French and nae Dutch neither,” said one.

“It is very true,” says she, “but since the year ’46 there are so many
of the honest Scotch abroad that I will be doing very well. I thank
you.”

There was a pretty country simplicity in this that made some laugh,
others looked the more sorry, and Mr. Gebbie fall outright in a
passion. I believe he knew it was his duty (his wife having accepted
charge of the girl) to have gone ashore with her and seen her safe:
nothing would have induced him to have done so, since it must have
involved the lose of his conveyance; and I think he made it up to his
conscience by the loudness of his voice. At least he broke out upon
Captain Sang, raging and saying the thing was a disgrace; that it was
mere death to try to leave the ship, and at any event we could not cast
down an innocent maid in a boatful of nasty Holland fishers, and leave
her to her fate. I was thinking something of the same; took the mate
upon one side, arranged with him to send on my chests by track-scoot to
an address I had in Leyden, and stood up and signalled to the fishers.

“I will go ashore with the young lady, Captain Sang,” said I. “It is
all one what way I go to Leyden;” and leaped at the same time into the
boat, which I managed not so elegantly but what I fell with two of the
fishers in the bilge.

From the boat the business appeared yet more precarious than from the
ship, she stood so high over us, swung down so swift, and menaced us so
perpetually with her plunging and passaging upon the anchor cable. I
began to think I had made a fool’s bargain, that it was merely
impossible Catriona should be got on board to me, and that I stood to
be set ashore at Helvoet all by myself and with no hope of any reward
but the pleasure of embracing James More, if I should want to. But this
was to reckon without the lass’s courage. She had seen me leap with
very little appearance (however much reality) of hesitation; to be
sure, she was not to be beat by her discarded friend. Up she stood on
the bulwarks and held by a stay, the wind blowing in her petticoats,
which made the enterprise more dangerous, and gave us rather more of a
view of her stockings than would be thought genteel in cities. There
was no minute lost, and scarce time given for any to interfere if they
had wished the same. I stood up on the other side and spread my arms;
the ship swung down on us, the patroon humoured his boat nearer in than
was perhaps wholly safe, and Catriona leaped into the air. I was so
happy as to catch her, and the fishers readily supporting us, escaped a
fall. She held to me a moment very tight, breathing quick and deep;
thence (she still clinging to me with both hands) we were passed aft to
our places by the steersman; and Captain Sang and all the crew and
passengers cheering and crying farewell, the boat was put about for
shore.

As soon as Catriona came a little to herself she unhanded me suddenly,
but said no word. No more did I; and indeed the whistling of the wind
and the breaching of the sprays made it no time for speech; and our
crew not only toiled excessively but made extremely little way, so that
the _Rose_ had got her anchor and was off again before we had
approached the harbour mouth.

We were no sooner in smooth water than the patroon, according to their
beastly Hollands custom, stopped his boat and required of us our fares.
Two guilders was the man’s demand—between three and four shillings
English money—for each passenger. But at this Catriona began to cry out
with a vast deal of agitation. She had asked of Captain Sang, she said,
and the fare was but an English shilling. “Do you think I will have
come on board and not ask first?” cries she. The patroon scolded back
upon her in a lingo where the oaths were English and the rest right
Hollands; till at last (seeing her near tears) I privately slipped in
the rogue’s hand six shillings, whereupon he was obliging enough to
receive from her the other shilling without more complaint. No doubt I
was a good deal nettled and ashamed. I like to see folk thrifty, but
not with so much passion; and I daresay it would be rather coldly that
I asked her, as the boat moved on again for shore, where it was that
she was trysted with her father.

“He is to be inquired of at the house of one Sprott, an honest Scotch
merchant,” says she; and then with the same breath, “I am wishing to
thank you very much—you are a brave friend to me.”

“It will be time enough when I get you to your father,” said I, little
thinking that I spoke so true. “I can tell him a fine tale of a loyal
daughter.”

“O, I do not think I will be a loyal girl, at all events,” she cried,
with a great deal of painfulness in the expression. “I do not think my
heart is true.”

“Yet there are very few that would have made that leap, and all to obey
a father’s orders,” I observed.

“I cannot have you to be thinking of me so,” she cried again. “When you
had done that same, how would I stop behind? And at all events that was
not all the reasons.” Whereupon, with a burning face, she told me the
plain truth upon her poverty.

“Good guide us!” cried I, “what kind of daft-like proceeding is this,
to let yourself be launched on the continent of Europe with an empty
purse—I count it hardly decent—scant decent!” I cried.

“You forget James More, my father, is a poor gentleman,” said she. “He
is a hunted exile.”

“But I think not all your friends are hunted exiles,” I exclaimed. “And
was this fair to them that care for you? Was it fair to me? was it fair
to Miss Grant that counselled you to go, and would be driven fair
horn-mad if she could hear of it? Was it even fair to these Gregory
folk that you were living with, and used you lovingly? It’s a blessing
you have fallen in my hands! Suppose your father hindered by an
accident, what would become of you here, and you your lee-lone in a
strange place? The thought of the thing frightens me,” I said.

“I will have lied to all of them,” she replied. “I will have told them
all that I had plenty. I told _her_ too. I could not be lowering James
More to them.”

I found out later on that she must have lowered him in the very dust,
for the lie was originally the father’s, not the daughter’s, and she
thus obliged to persevere in it for the man’s reputation. But at the
time I was ignorant of this, and the mere thought of her destitution
and the perils in which see must have fallen, had ruffled me almost
beyond reason.

“Well, well, well,” said I, “you will have to learn more sense.”

I left her mails for the moment in an inn upon the shore, where I got a
direction for Sprott’s house in my new French, and we walked there—it
was some little way—beholding the place with wonder as we went. Indeed,
there was much for Scots folk to admire: canals and trees being
intermingled with the houses; the houses, each within itself, of a
brave red brick, the colour of a rose, with steps and benches of blue
marble at the cheek of every door, and the whole town so clean you
might have dined upon the causeway. Sprott was within, upon his
ledgers, in a low parlour, very neat and clean, and set out with china
and pictures, and a globe of the earth in a brass frame. He was a
big-chafted, ruddy, lusty man, with a crooked hard look to him; and he
made us not that much civility as offer us a seat.

“Is James More Macgregor now in Helvoet, sir?” says I.

“I ken nobody by such a name,” says he, impatient-like.

“Since you are so particular,” says I, “I will amend my question, and
ask you where we are to find in Helvoet one James Drummond, _alias_
Macgregor, _alias_ James More, late tenant in Inveronachile?”

“Sir,” says he, “he may be in Hell for what I ken, and for my part I
wish he was.”

“The young lady is that gentleman’s daughter, sir,” said I, “before
whom, I think you will agree with me, it is not very becoming to
discuss his character.”

“I have nothing to make either with him, or her, or you!” cries he in
his gross voice.

“Under your favour, Mr. Sprott,” said I, “this young lady is come from
Scotland seeking him, and by whatever mistake, was given the name of
your house for a direction. An error it seems to have been, but I think
this places both you and me—who am but her fellow-traveller by
accident—under a strong obligation to help our countrywoman.”

“Will you ding me daft?” he cries. “I tell ye I ken naething and care
less either for him or his breed. I tell ye the man owes me money.”

“That may very well be, sir,” said I, who was now rather more angry
than himself. “At least, I owe you nothing; the young lady is under my
protection; and I am neither at all used with these manners, nor in the
least content with them.”

As I said this, and without particularly thinking what I did, I drew a
step or two nearer to his table; thus striking, by mere good fortune,
on the only argument that could at all affect the man. The blood left
his lusty countenance.

“For the Lord’s sake dinna be hasty, sir!” he cried. “I am truly
wishfu’ no to be offensive. But ye ken, sir, I’m like a wheen
guid-natured, honest, canty auld fellows—my bark is waur nor my bite.
To hear me, ye micht whiles fancy I was a wee thing dour; but na, na!
it’s a kind auld fallow at heart, Sandie Sprott! And ye could never
imagine the fyke and fash this man has been to me.”

“Very good, sir,” said I. “Then I will make that much freedom with your
kindness as trouble you for your last news of Mr. Drummond.”

“You’re welcome, sir!” said he. “As for the young leddy (my respects to
her!), he’ll just have clean forgotten her. I ken the man, ye see; I
have lost siller by him ere now. He thinks of naebody but just himsel’;
clan, king, or dauchter, if he can get his wameful, he would give them
a’ the go-by! ay, or his correspondent either. For there is a sense in
whilk I may be nearly almost said to be his correspondent. The fact is,
we are employed thegether in a business affair, and I think it’s like
to turn out a dear affair for Sandie Sprott. The man’s as guid’s my
pairtner, and I give ye my mere word I ken naething by where he is. He
micht be coming here to Helvoet; he micht come here the morn, he
michtnae come for a twalmouth; I would wonder at naething—or just at
the ae thing, and that’s if he was to pay me my siller. Ye see what way
I stand with it; and it’s clear I’m no very likely to meddle up with
the young leddy, as ye ca’ her. She cannae stop here, that’s ae thing
certain sure. Dod, sir, I’m a lone man! If I was to tak her in, its
highly possible the hellicat would try and gar me marry her when he
turned up.”

“Enough of this talk,” said I. “I will take the young leddy among
better friends. Give me, pen, ink, and paper, and I will leave here for
James More the address of my correspondent in Leyden. He can inquire
from me where he is to seek his daughter.”

This word I wrote and sealed; which while I was doing, Sprott of his
own motion made a welcome offer, to charge himself with Miss Drummond’s
mails, and even send a porter for them to the inn. I advanced him to
that effect a dollar or two to be a cover, and he gave me an
acknowledgment in writing of the sum.

Whereupon (I giving my arm to Catriona) we left the house of this
unpalatable rascal. She had said no word throughout, leaving me to
judge and speak in her place; I, upon my side, had been careful not to
embarrass her by a glance; and even now, although my heart still glowed
inside of me with shame and anger, I made it my affair to seem quite
easy.

“Now,” said I, “let us get back to yon same inn where they can speak
the French, have a piece of dinner, and inquire for conveyances to
Rotterdam. I will never be easy till I have you safe again in the hands
of Mrs. Gebbie.”

“I suppose it will have to be,” said Catriona, “though whoever will be
pleased, I do not think it will be her. And I will remind you this once
again that I have but one shilling, and three baubees.”

“And just this once again,” said I, “I will remind you it was a
blessing that I came alongst with you.”

“What else would I be thinking all this time?” says she, and I thought
weighed a little on my arm. “It is you that are the good friend to me.”




CHAPTER XXIII.
TRAVELS IN HOLLAND


The rattel-waggon, which is a kind of a long waggon set with benches,
carried us in four hours of travel to the great city of Rotterdam. It
was long past dark by then, but the streets were pretty brightly
lighted and thronged with wild-like, outlandish characters—bearded
Hebrews, black men, and the hordes of courtesans, most indecently
adorned with finery and stopping seamen by their very sleeves; the
clash of talk about us made our heads to whirl; and what was the most
unexpected of all, we appeared to be no more struck with all these
foreigners than they with us. I made the best face I could, for the
lass’s sake and my own credit; but the truth is I felt like a lost
sheep, and my heart beat in my bosom with anxiety. Once or twice I
inquired after the harbour or the berth of the ship _Rose_: but either
fell on some who spoke only Hollands, or my own French failed me.
Trying a street at a venture, I came upon a lane of lighted houses, the
doors and windows thronged with wauf-like painted women; these jostled
and mocked upon us as we passed, and I was thankful we had nothing of
their language. A little after we issued forth upon an open place along
the harbour.

“We shall be doing now,” cries I, as soon as I spied masts. “Let us
walk here by the harbour. We are sure to meet some that has the
English, and at the best of it we may light upon that very ship.”

We did the next best, as happened; for, about nine of the evening, whom
should we walk into the arms of but Captain Sang? He told us they had
made their run in the most incredible brief time, the wind holding
strong till they reached port; by which means his passengers were all
gone already on their further travels. It was impossible to chase after
the Gebbies into the High Germany, and we had no other acquaintance to
fall back upon but Captain Sang himself. It was the more gratifying to
find the man friendly and wishful to assist. He made it a small affair
to find some good plain family of merchants, where Catriona might
harbour till the _Rose_ was loaden; declared he would then blithely
carry her back to Leith for nothing and see her safe in the hands of
Mr. Gregory; and in the meanwhile carried us to a late ordinary for the
meal we stood in need of. He seemed extremely friendly, as I say, but
what surprised me a good deal, rather boisterous in the bargain; and
the cause of this was soon to appear. For at the ordinary, calling for
Rhenish wine and drinking of it deep, he soon became unutterably tipsy.
In this case, as too common with all men, but especially with those of
his rough trade, what little sense or manners he possessed deserted
him; and he behaved himself so scandalous to the young lady, jesting
most ill-favouredly at the figure she had made on the ship’s rail, that
I had no resource but carry her suddenly away.

She came out of the ordinary clinging to me close. “Take me away,
David,” she said. “_You_ keep me. I am not afraid with you.”

“And have no cause, my little friend!” cried I, and could have found it
in my heart to weep.

“Where will you be taking me?” she said again. “Don’t leave me at all
events—never leave me.”

“Where am I taking you to?” says I stopping, for I had been staving on
ahead in mere blindness. “I must stop and think. But I’ll not leave
you, Catriona; the Lord do so to me, and more also, if I should fail or
fash you.”

She crept close into me by way of a reply.

“Here,” I said, “is the stillest place we have hit on yet in this busy
byke of a city. Let us sit down here under yon tree and consider of our
course.”

That tree (which I am little like to forget) stood hard by the harbour
side. It was like a black night, but lights were in the houses, and
nearer hand in the quiet ships; there was a shining of the city on the
one hand, and a buzz hung over it of many thousands walking and
talking; on the other, it was dark and the water bubbled on the sides.
I spread my cloak upon a builder’s stone, and made her sit there; she
would have kept her hold upon me, for she still shook with the late
affronts; but I wanted to think clear, disengaged myself, and paced to
and fro before her, in the manner of what we call a smuggler’s walk,
belabouring my brains for any remedy. By the course of these scattering
thoughts I was brought suddenly face to face with a remembrance that,
in the heat and haste of our departure, I had left Captain Sang to pay
the ordinary. At this I began to laugh out loud, for I thought the man
well served; and at the same time, by an instinctive movement, carried
my hand to the pocket where my money was. I suppose it was in the lane
where the women jostled us; but there is only the one thing certain,
that my purse was gone.

“You will have thought of something good,” said she, observing me to
pause.

At the pinch we were in, my mind became suddenly clear as a perspective
glass, and I saw there was no choice of methods. I had not one doit of
coin, but in my pocket-book I had still my letter on the Leyden
merchant; and there was now but the one way to get to Leyden, and that
was to walk on our two feet.

“Catriona,” said I, “I know you’re brave and I believe you’re strong—do
you think you could walk thirty miles on a plain road?” We found it, I
believe, scarce the two-thirds of that, but such was my notion of the
distance.

“David,” she said, “if you will just keep near, I will go anywhere and
do anything. The courage of my heart, it is all broken. Do not be
leaving me in this horrible country by myself, and I will do all else.”

“Can you start now and march all night?” said I.

“I will do all that you can ask of me,” she said, “and never ask you
why. I have been a bad ungrateful girl to you; and do what you please
with me now! And I think Miss Barbara Grant is the best lady in the
world,” she added, “and I do not see what she would deny you for at all
events.”

This was Greek and Hebrew to me; but I had other matters to consider,
and the first of these was to get clear of that city on the Leyden
road. It proved a cruel problem; and it may have been one or two at
night ere we had solved it. Once beyond the houses, there was neither
moon nor stars to guide us; only the whiteness of the way in the midst
and a blackness of an alley on both hands. The walking was besides made
most extraordinary difficult by a plain black frost that fell suddenly
in the small hours and turned that highway into one long slide.

“Well, Catriona,” said I, “here we are like the king’s sons and the old
wives’ daughters in your daft-like Highland tales. Soon we’ll be going
over the ‘_seven Bens_, _the seven glens and the seven mountain
moors_’.” Which was a common byword or overcome in those tales of hers
that had stuck in my memory.

“Ah,” says she, “but here are no glens or mountains! Though I will
never be denying but what the trees and some of the plain places
hereabouts are very pretty. But our country is the best yet.”

“I wish we could say as much for our own folk,” says I, recalling
Sprott and Sang, and perhaps James More himself.

“I will never complain of the country of my friend,” said she, and
spoke it out with an accent so particular that I seemed to see the look
upon her face.

I caught in my breath sharp and came near falling (for my pains) on the
black ice.

“I do not know what _you_ think, Catriona,” said I, when I was a little
recovered, “but this has been the best day yet! I think shame to say
it, when you have met in with such misfortunes and disfavours; but for
me, it has been the best day yet.”

“It was a good day when you showed me so much love,” said she.

“And yet I think shame to be happy too,” I went on, “and you here on
the road in the black night.”

“Where in the great world would I be else?” she cried. “I am thinking I
am safest where I am with you.”

“I am quite forgiven, then?” I asked.

“Will you not forgive me that time so much as not to take it in your
mouth again?” she cried. “There is nothing in this heart to you but
thanks. But I will be honest too,” she added, with a kind of
suddenness, “and I’ll never can forgive that girl.”

“Is this Miss Grant again?” said I. “You said yourself she was the best
lady in the world.”

“So she will be, indeed!” says Catriona. “But I will never forgive her
for all that. I will never, never forgive her, and let me hear tell of
her no more.”

“Well,” said I, “this beats all that ever came to my knowledge; and I
wonder that you can indulge yourself in such bairnly whims. Here is a
young lady that was the best friend in the world to the both of us,
that learned us how to dress ourselves, and in a great manner how to
behave, as anyone can see that knew us both before and after.”

But Catriona stopped square in the midst of the highway.

“It is this way of it,” said she. “Either you will go on to speak of
her, and I will go back to yon town, and let come of it what God
pleases! Or else you will do me that politeness to talk of other
things.”

I was the most nonplussed person in this world; but I bethought me that
she depended altogether on my help, that she was of the frail sex and
not so much beyond a child, and it was for me to be wise for the pair
of us.

“My dear girl,” said I, “I can make neither head nor tails of this; but
God forbid that I should do anything to set you on the jee. As for
talking of Miss Grant, I have no such a mind to it, and I believe it
was yourself began it. My only design (if I took you up at all) was for
your own improvement, for I hate the very look of injustice. Not that I
do not wish you to have a good pride and a nice female delicacy; they
become you well; but here you show them to excess.”

“Well, then, have you done?” said she.

“I have done,” said I.

“A very good thing,” said she, and we went on again, but now in
silence.

It was an eerie employment to walk in the gross night, beholding only
shadows and hearing nought but our own steps. At first, I believe our
hearts burned against each other with a deal of enmity; but the
darkness and the cold, and the silence, which only the cocks sometimes
interrupted, or sometimes the farmyard dogs, had pretty soon brought
down our pride to the dust; and for my own particular, I would have
jumped at any decent opening for speech.

Before the day peeped, came on a warmish rain, and the frost was all
wiped away from among our feet. I took my cloak to her and sought to
hap her in the same; she bade me, rather impatiently, to keep it.

“Indeed and I will do no such thing,” said I. “Here am I, a great, ugly
lad that has seen all kinds of weather, and here are you a tender,
pretty maid! My dear, you would not put me to a shame?”

Without more words she let me cover her; which as I was doing in the
darkness, I let my hand rest a moment on her shoulder, almost like an
embrace.

“You must try to be more patient of your friend,” said I.

I thought she seemed to lean the least thing in the world against my
bosom, or perhaps it was but fancy.

“There will be no end to your goodness,” said she.

And we went on again in silence; but now all was changed; and the
happiness that was in my heart was like a fire in a great chimney.

The rain passed ere day; it was but a sloppy morning as we came into
the town of Delft. The red gabled houses made a handsome show on either
hand of a canal; the servant lassies were out slestering and scrubbing
at the very stones upon the public highway; smoke rose from a hundred
kitchens; and it came in upon me strongly it was time to break our
fasts.

“Catriona,” said I, “I believe you have yet a shilling and three
baubees?”

“Are you wanting it?” said she, and passed me her purse. “I am wishing
it was five pounds! What will you want it for?”

“And what have we been walking for all night, like a pair of waif
Egyptians!” says I. “Just because I was robbed of my purse and all I
possessed in that unchancy town of Rotterdam. I will tell you of it
now, because I think the worst is over, but we have still a good tramp
before us till we get to where my money is, and if you would not buy me
a piece of bread, I were like to go fasting.”

She looked at me with open eyes. By the light of the new day she was
all black and pale for weariness, so that my heart smote me for her.
But as for her, she broke out laughing.

“My torture! are we beggars then!” she cried. “You too? O, I could have
wished for this same thing! And I am glad to buy your breakfast to you.
But it would be pleisand if I would have had to dance to get a meal to
you! For I believe they are not very well acquainted with our manner of
dancing over here, and might be paying for the curiosity of that
sight.”

I could have kissed her for that word, not with a lover’s mind, but in
a heat of admiration. For it always warms a man to see a woman brave.

We got a drink of milk from a country wife but new come to the town,
and in a baker’s, a piece of excellent, hot, sweet-smelling bread,
which we ate upon the road as we went on. That road from Delft to the
Hague is just five miles of a fine avenue shaded with trees, a canal on
the one hand, on the other excellent pastures of cattle. It was
pleasant here indeed.

“And now, Davie,” said she, “what will you do with me at all events?”

“It is what we have to speak of,” said I, “and the sooner yet the
better. I can come by money in Leyden; that will be all well. But the
trouble is how to dispose of you until your father come. I thought last
night you seemed a little sweir to part from me?”

“It will be more than seeming then,” said she.

“You are a very young maid,” said I, “and I am but a very young
callant. This is a great piece of difficulty. What way are we to
manage? Unless indeed, you could pass to be my sister?”

“And what for no?” said she, “if you would let me!”

“I wish you were so, indeed,” I cried. “I would be a fine man if I had
such a sister. But the rub is that you are Catriona Drummond.”

“And now I will be Catriona Balfour,” she said. “And who is to ken?
They are all strange folk here.”

“If you think that it would do,” says I. “I own it troubles me. I would
like it very ill, if I advised you at all wrong.”

“David, I have no friend here but you,” she said.

“The mere truth is, I am too young to be your friend,” said I. “I am
too young to advise you, or you to be advised. I see not what else we
are to do, and yet I ought to warn you.”

“I will have no choice left,” said she. “My father James More has not
used me very well, and it is not the first time, I am cast upon your
hands like a sack of barley meal, and have nothing else to think of but
your pleasure. If you will have me, good and well. If you will not”—she
turned and touched her hand upon my arm—“David, I am afraid,” said she.

“No, but I ought to warn you,” I began; and then bethought me I was the
bearer of the purse, and it would never do to seem too churlish.
“Catriona,” said I, “don’t misunderstand me: I am just trying to do my
duty by you, girl! Here am I going alone to this strange city, to be a
solitary student there; and here is this chance arisen that you might
dwell with me a bit, and be like my sister; you can surely understand
this much, my dear, that I would just love to have you?”

“Well, and here I am,” said she. “So that’s soon settled.”

I know I was in duty bounden to have spoke more plain. I know this was
a great blot on my character, for which I was lucky that I did not pay
more dear. But I minded how easy her delicacy had been startled with a
word of kissing her in Barbara’s letter; now that she depended on me,
how was I to be more bold? Besides, the truth is, I could see no other
feasible method to dispose of her. And I daresay inclination pulled me
very strong.

A little beyond the Hague she fell very lame and made the rest of the
distance heavily enough. Twice she must rest by the wayside, which she
did with pretty apologies, calling herself a shame to the Highlands and
the race she came of, and nothing but a hindrance to myself. It was her
excuse, she said, that she was not much used with walking shod. I would
have had her strip off her shoes and stockings and go barefoot. But she
pointed out to me that the women of that country, even in the landward
roads, appeared to be all shod.

“I must not be disgracing my brother,” said she, and was very merry
with it all, although her face told tales of her.

There is a garden in that city we were bound to, sanded below with
clean sand, the trees meeting overhead, some of them trimmed, some
preached, and the whole place beautified with alleys and arbours. Here
I left Catriona, and went forward by myself to find my correspondent.
There I drew on my credit, and asked to be recommended to some decent,
retired lodging. My baggage being not yet arrived, I told him I
supposed I should require his caution with the people of the house; and
explained that, my sister being come for a while to keep house with me,
I should be wanting two chambers. This was all very well; but the
trouble was that Mr. Balfour in his letter of recommendation had
condescended on a great deal of particulars, and never a word of any
sister in the case. I could see my Dutchman was extremely suspicious;
and viewing me over the rims of a great pair of spectacles—he was a
poor, frail body, and reminded me of an infirm rabbit—he began to
question me close.

Here I fell in a panic. Suppose he accept my tale (thinks I), suppose
he invite my sister to his house, and that I bring her. I shall have a
fine ravelled pirn to unwind, and may end by disgracing both the lassie
and myself. Thereupon I began hastily to expound to him my sister’s
character. She was of a bashful disposition, it appeared, and be
extremely fearful of meeting strangers that I had left her at that
moment sitting in a public place alone. And then, being launched upon
the stream of falsehood, I must do like all the rest of the world in
the same circumstance, and plunge in deeper than was any service;
adding some altogether needless particulars of Miss Balfour’s
ill-health and retirement during childhood. In the midst of which I
awoke to a sense of my behaviour, and was turned to one blush.

The old gentleman was not so much deceived but what he discovered a
willingness to be quit of me. But he was first of all a man of
business; and knowing that my money was good enough, however it might
be with my conduct, he was so far obliging as to send his son to be my
guide and caution in the matter of a lodging. This implied my
presenting of the young man to Catriona. The poor, pretty child was
much recovered with resting, looked and behaved to perfection, and took
my arm and gave me the name of brother more easily than I could answer
her. But there was one misfortune: thinking to help, she was rather
towardly than otherwise to my Dutchman. And I could not but reflect
that Miss Balfour had rather suddenly outgrown her bashfulness. And
there was another thing, the difference of our speech. I had the Low
Country tongue and dwelled upon my words; she had a hill voice, spoke
with something of an English accent, only far more delightful, and was
scarce quite fit to be called a deacon in the craft of talking English
grammar; so that, for a brother and sister, we made a most uneven pair.
But the young Hollander was a heavy dog, without so much spirit in his
belly as to remark her prettiness, for which I scorned him. And as soon
as he had found a cover to our heads, he left us alone, which was the
greater service of the two.




CHAPTER XXIV.
FULL STORY OF A COPY OF HEINECCIUS


The place found was in the upper part of a house backed on a canal. We
had two rooms, the second entering from the first; each had a chimney
built out into the floor in the Dutch manner; and being alongside, each
had the same prospect from the window of the top of a tree below us in
a little court, of a piece of the canal, and of houses in the Hollands
architecture and a church spire upon the further side. A full set of
bells hung in that spire and made delightful music; and when there was
any sun at all, it shone direct in our two chambers. From a tavern hard
by we had good meals sent in.

The first night we were both pretty weary, and she extremely so. There
was little talk between us, and I packed her off to her bed as soon as
she had eaten. The first thing in the morning I wrote word to Sprott to
have her mails sent on, together with a line to Alan at his chief’s;
and had the same despatched, and her breakfast ready, ere I waked her.
I was a little abashed when she came forth in her one habit, and the
mud of the way upon her stockings. By what inquiries I had made, it
seemed a good few days must pass before her mails could come to hand in
Leyden, and it was plainly needful she must have a shift of things. She
was unwilling at first that I should go to that expense; but I reminded
her she was now a rich man’s sister and must appear suitably in the
part, and we had not got to the second merchant’s before she was
entirely charmed into the spirit of the thing, and her eyes shining. It
pleased me to see her so innocent and thorough in this pleasure. What
was more extraordinary was the passion into which I fell on it myself;
being never satisfied that I had bought her enough or fine enough, and
never weary of beholding her in different attires. Indeed, I began to
understand some little of Miss Grant’s immersion in the interest of
clothes; for the truth is, when you have the ground of a beautiful
person to adorn, the whole business becomes beautiful. The Dutch
chintzes I should say were extraordinary cheap and fine; but I would be
ashamed to set down what I paid for stockings to her. Altogether I
spent so great a sum upon this pleasuring (as I may call it) that I was
ashamed for a great while to spend more; and by way of a set-off, I
left our chambers pretty bare. If we had beds, if Catriona was a little
braw, and I had light to see her by, we were richly enough lodged for
me.

By the end of this merchandising I was glad to leave her at the door
with all our purchases, and go for a long walk alone in which to read
myself a lecture. Here had I taken under my roof, and as good as to my
bosom, a young lass extremely beautiful, and whose innocence was her
peril. My talk with the old Dutchman, and the lies to which I was
constrained, had already given me a sense of how my conduct must appear
to others; and now, after the strong admiration I had just experienced
and the immoderacy with which I had continued my vain purchases, I
began to think of it myself as very hazarded. I bethought me, if I had
a sister indeed, whether I would so expose her; then, judging the case
too problematical, I varied my question into this, whether I would so
trust Catriona in the hands of any other Christian being; the answer to
which made my face to burn. The more cause, since I had been entrapped
and had entrapped the girl into an undue situation, that I should
behave in it with scrupulous nicety. She depended on me wholly for her
bread and shelter; in case I should alarm her delicacy, she had no
retreat. Besides I was her host and her protector; and the more
irregularly I had fallen in these positions, the less excuse for me if
I should profit by the same to forward even the most honest suit; for
with the opportunities that I enjoyed, and which no wise parent would
have suffered for a moment, even the most honest suit would be unfair.
I saw I must be extremely hold-off in my relations; and yet not too
much so neither; for if I had no right to appear at all in the
character of a suitor, I must yet appear continually, and if possible
agreeably, in that of host. It was plain I should require a great deal
of tact and conduct, perhaps more than my years afforded. But I had
rushed in where angels might have feared to tread, and there was no way
out of that position save by behaving right while I was in it. I made a
set of rules for my guidance; prayed for strength to be enabled to
observe them, and as a more human aid to the same end purchased a
study-book in law. This being all that I could think of, I relaxed from
these grave considerations; whereupon my mind bubbled at once into an
effervescency of pleasing spirits, and it was like one treading on air
that I turned homeward. As I thought that name of home, and recalled
the image of that figure awaiting me between four walls, my heart beat
upon my bosom.

My troubles began with my return. She ran to greet me with an obvious
and affecting pleasure. She was clad, besides, entirely in the new
clothes that I had bought for her; looked in them beyond expression
well; and must walk about and drop me curtseys to display them and to
be admired. I am sure I did it with an ill grace, for I thought to have
choked upon the words.

“Well,” she said, “if you will not be caring for my pretty clothes, see
what I have done with our two chambers.” And she showed me the place
all very finely swept, and the fires glowing in the two chimneys.

I was glad of a chance to seem a little more severe than I quite felt.
“Catriona,” said I, “I am very much displeased with you, and you must
never again lay a hand upon my room. One of us two must have the rule
while we are here together; it is most fit it should be I who am both
the man and the elder; and I give you that for my command.”

She dropped me one of her curtseys; which were extraordinary taking.
“If you will be cross,” said she, “I must be making pretty manners at
you, Davie. I will be very obedient, as I should be when every stitch
upon all there is of me belongs to you. But you will not be very cross
either, because now I have not anyone else.”

This struck me hard, and I made haste, in a kind of penitence, to blot
out all the good effect of my last speech. In this direction progress
was more easy, being down hill; she led me forward, smiling; at the
sight of her, in the brightness of the fire and with her pretty becks
and looks, my heart was altogether melted. We made our meal with
infinite mirth and tenderness; and the two seemed to be commingled into
one, so that our very laughter sounded like a kindness.

In the midst of which I awoke to better recollections, made a lame word
of excuse, and set myself boorishly to my studies. It was a
substantial, instructive book that I had bought, by the late Dr.
Heineccius, in which I was to do a great deal reading these next few
days, and often very glad that I had no one to question me of what I
read. Methought she bit her lip at me a little, and that cut me. Indeed
it left her wholly solitary, the more as she was very little of a
reader, and had never a book. But what was I to do?

So the rest of the evening flowed by almost without speech.

I could have beat myself. I could not lie in my bed that night for rage
and repentance, but walked to and fro on my bare feet till I was nearly
perished, for the chimney was gone out and the frost keen. The thought
of her in the next room, the thought that she might even hear me as I
walked, the remembrance of my churlishness and that I must continue to
practise the same ungrateful course or be dishonoured, put me beside my
reason. I stood like a man between Scylla and Charybdis: _What must she
think of me_? was my one thought that softened me continually into
weakness. _What is to become of us_? the other which steeled me again
to resolution. This was my first night of wakefulness and divided
counsels, of which I was now to pass many, pacing like a madman,
sometimes weeping like a childish boy, sometimes praying (I fain would
hope) like a Christian.

But prayer is not very difficult, and the hitch comes in practice. In
her presence, and above all if I allowed any beginning of familiarity,
I found I had very little command of what should follow. But to sit all
day in the same room with her, and feign to be engaged upon Heineccius,
surpassed my strength. So that I fell instead upon the expedient of
absenting myself so much as I was able; taking out classes and sitting
there regularly, often with small attention, the test of which I found
the other day in a note-book of that period, where I had left off to
follow an edifying lecture and actually scribbled in my book some very
ill verses, though the Latinity is rather better than I thought that I
could ever have compassed. The evil of this course was unhappily near
as great as its advantage. I had the less time of trial, but I believe,
while the time lasted, I was tried the more extremely. For she being so
much left to solitude, she came to greet my return with an increasing
fervour that came nigh to overmaster me. These friendly offers I must
barbarously cast back; and my rejection sometimes wounded her so
cruelly that I must unbend and seek to make it up to her in kindness.
So that our time passed in ups and downs, tiffs and disappointments,
upon the which I could almost say (if it may be said with reverence)
that I was crucified.

The base of my trouble was Catriona’s extraordinary innocence, at which
I was not so much surprised as filled with pity and admiration. She
seemed to have no thought of our position, no sense of my struggles;
welcomed any mark of my weakness with responsive joy; and when I was
drove again to my retrenchments, did not always dissemble her chagrin.
There were times when I have thought to myself, “If she were over head
in love, and set her cap to catch me, she would scarce behave much
otherwise;” and then I would fall again into wonder at the simplicity
of woman, from whom I felt (in these moments) that I was not worthy to
be descended.

There was one point in particular on which our warfare turned, and of
all things, this was the question of her clothes. My baggage had soon
followed me from Rotterdam, and hers from Helvoet. She had now, as it
were, two wardrobes; and it grew to be understood between us (I could
never tell how) that when she was friendly she would wear my clothes,
and when otherwise her own. It was meant for a buffet, and (as it were)
the renunciation of her gratitude; and I felt it so in my bosom, but
was generally more wise than to appear to have observed the
circumstance.

Once, indeed, I was betrayed into a childishness greater than her own;
it fell in this way. On my return from classes, thinking upon her
devoutly with a great deal of love and a good deal of annoyance in the
bargain, the annoyance began to fade away out of my mind; and spying in
a window one of those forced flowers, of which the Hollanders are so
skilled in the artifice, I gave way to an impulse and bought it for
Catriona. I do not know the name of that flower, but it was of the pink
colour, and I thought she would admire the same, and carried it home to
her with a wonderful soft heart. I had left her in my clothes, and when
I returned to find her all changed and a face to match, I cast but the
one look at her from head to foot, ground my teeth together, flung the
window open, and my flower into the court, and then (between rage and
prudence) myself out of that room again, of which I slammed she door as
I went out.

On the steep stair I came near falling, and this brought me to myself,
so that I began at once to see the folly of my conduct. I went, not
into the street as I had purposed, but to the house court, which was
always a solitary place, and where I saw my flower (that had cost me
vastly more than it was worth) hanging in the leafless tree. I stood by
the side of the canal, and looked upon the ice. Country people went by
on their skates, and I envied them. I could see no way out of the
pickle I was in no way so much as to return to the room I had just
left. No doubt was in my mind but I had now betrayed the secret of my
feelings; and to make things worse, I had shown at the same time (and
that with wretched boyishness) incivility to my helpless guest.

I suppose she must have seen me from the open window. It did not seem
to me that I had stood there very long before I heard the crunching of
footsteps on the frozen snow, and turning somewhat angrily (for I was
in no spirit to be interrupted) saw Catriona drawing near. She was all
changed again, to the clocked stockings.

“Are we not to have our walk to-day?” said she.

I was looking at her in a maze. “Where is your brooch?” says I.

She carried her hand to her bosom and coloured high. “I will have
forgotten it,” said she. “I will run upstairs for it quick, and then
surely we’ll can have our walk?”

There was a note of pleading in that last that staggered me; I had
neither words nor voice to utter them; I could do no more than nod by
way of answer; and the moment she had left me, climbed into the tree
and recovered my flower, which on her return I offered her.

“I bought it for you, Catriona,” said I.

She fixed it in the midst of her bosom with the brooch, I could have
thought tenderly.

“It is none the better of my handling,” said I again, and blushed.

“I will be liking it none the worse, you may be sure of that,” said
she.

We did not speak so much that day; she seemed a thought on the reserve,
though not unkindly. As for me, all the time of our walking, and after
we came home, and I had seen her put my flower into a pot of water, I
was thinking to myself what puzzles women were. I was thinking, the one
moment, it was the most stupid thing on earth she should not have
perceived my love; and the next, that she had certainly perceived it
long ago, and (being a wise girl with the fine female instinct of
propriety) concealed her knowledge.

We had our walk daily. Out in the streets I felt more safe; I relaxed a
little in my guardedness; and for one thing, there was no Heineccius.
This made these periods not only a relief to myself, but a particular
pleasure to my poor child. When I came back about the hour appointed, I
would generally find her ready dressed, and glowing with anticipation.
She would prolong their duration to the extreme, seeming to dread (as I
did myself) the hour of the return; and there is scarce a field or
waterside near Leyden, scarce a street or lane there, where we have not
lingered. Outside of these, I bade her confine herself entirely to our
lodgings; this in the fear of her encountering any acquaintance, which
would have rendered our position very difficult. From the same
apprehension I would never suffer her to attend church, nor even go
myself; but made some kind of shift to hold worship privately in our
own chamber—I hope with an honest, but I am quite sure with a very much
divided mind. Indeed, there was scarce anything that more affected me,
than thus to kneel down alone with her before God like man and wife.

One day it was snowing downright hard. I had thought it not possible
that we should venture forth, and was surprised to find her waiting for
me ready dressed.

“I will not be doing without my walk,” she cried. “You are never a good
boy, Davie, in the house; I will never be caring for you only in the
open air. I think we two will better turn Egyptian and dwell by the
roadside.”

That was the best walk yet of all of them; she clung near to me in the
falling snow; it beat about and melted on us, and the drops stood upon
her bright cheeks like tears and ran into her smiling mouth. Strength
seemed to come upon me with the sight like a giant’s; I thought I could
have caught her up and run with her into the uttermost places in the
earth; and we spoke together all that time beyond belief for freedom
and sweetness.

It was the dark night when we came to the house door. She pressed my
arm upon her bosom. “Thank you kindly for these same good hours,” said
she, on a deep note of her voice.

The concern in which I fell instantly on this address, put me with the
same swiftness on my guard; and we were no sooner in the chamber, and
the light made, than she beheld the old, dour, stubborn countenance of
the student of Heineccius. Doubtless she was more than usually hurt;
and I know for myself, I found it more than usually difficult to
maintain any strangeness. Even at the meal, I durst scarce unbuckle and
scarce lift my eyes to her; and it was no sooner over than I fell again
to my civilian, with more seeming abstraction and less understanding
than before. Methought, as I read, I could hear my heart strike like an
eight-day clock. Hard as I feigned to study, there was still some of my
eyesight that spilled beyond the book upon Catriona. She sat on the
floor by the side of my great mail, and the chimney lighted her up, and
shone and blinked upon her, and made her glow and darken through a
wonder of fine hues. Now she would be gazing in the fire, and then
again at me; and at that I would be plunged in a terror of myself, and
turn the pages of Heineccius like a man looking for the text in church.

Suddenly she called out aloud. “O, why does not my father come?” she
cried, and fell at once into a storm of tears.

I leaped up, flung Heineccius fairly in the fire, ran to her side, and
cast an arm around her sobbing body.

She put me from her sharply, “You do not love your friend,” says she.
“I could be so happy too, if you would let me!” And then, “O, what will
I have done that you should hate me so?”

“Hate you!” cries I, and held her firm. “You blind less, can you not
see a little in my wretched heart? Do you not think when I sit there,
reading in that fool-book that I have just burned and be damned to it,
I take ever the least thought of any stricken thing but just yourself?
Night after night I could have grat to see you sitting there your lone.
And what was I to do? You are here under my honour; would you punish me
for that? Is it for that that you would spurn a loving servant?”

At the word, with a small, sudden motion, she clung near to me. I
raised her face to mine, I kissed it, and she bowed her brow upon my
bosom, clasping me tight. I saw in a mere whirl like a man drunken.
Then I heard her voice sound very small and muffled in my clothes.

“Did you kiss her truly?” she asked.

There went through me so great a heave of surprise that I was all shook
with it.

“Miss Grant?” I cried, all in a disorder. “Yes, I asked her to kiss me
good-bye, the which she did.”

“Ah, well!” said she, “you have kissed me too, at all events.”

At the strangeness and sweetness of that word, I saw where we had
fallen; rose, and set her on her feet.

“This will never do,” said I. “This will never, never do. O Catrine,
Catrine!” Then there came a pause in which I was debarred from any
speaking. And then, “Go away to your bed,” said I. “Go away to your bed
and leave me.”

She turned to obey me like a child, and the next I knew of it, had
stopped in the very doorway.

“Good night, Davie!” said she.

“And O, good night, my love!” I cried, with a great outbreak of my
soul, and caught her to me again, so that it seemed I must have broken
her. The next moment I had thrust her from the room, shut to the door
even with violence, and stood alone.

The milk was spilt now, the word was out and the truth told. I had
crept like an untrusty man into the poor maid’s affections; she was in
my hand like any frail, innocent thing to make or mar; and what weapon
of defence was left me? It seemed like a symbol that Heineccius, my old
protection, was now burned. I repented, yet could not find it in my
heart to blame myself for that great failure. It seemed not possible to
have resisted the boldness of her innocence or that last temptation of
her weeping. And all that I had to excuse me did but make my sin appear
the greater—it was upon a nature so defenceless, and with such
advantages of the position, that I seemed to have practised.

What was to become of us now? It seemed we could no longer dwell in the
one place. But where was I to go? or where she? Without either choice
or fault of ours, life had conspired to wall us together in that narrow
place. I had a wild thought of marrying out of hand; and the next
moment put it from me with revolt. She was a child, she could not tell
her own heart; I had surprised her weakness, I must never go on to
build on that surprisal; I must keep her not only clear of reproach,
but free as she had come to me.

Down I sat before the fire, and reflected, and repented, and beat my
brains in vain for any means of escape. About two of the morning, there
were three red embers left and the house and all the city was asleep,
when I was aware of a small sound of weeping in the next room. She
thought that I slept, the poor soul; she regretted her weakness—and
what perhaps (God help her!) she called her forwardness—and in the dead
of the night solaced herself with tears. Tender and bitter feelings,
love and penitence and pity, struggled in my soul; it seemed I was
under bond to heal that weeping.

“O, try to forgive me!” I cried out, “try, try to forgive me. Let us
forget it all, let us try if we’ll no can forget it!”

There came no answer, but the sobbing ceased. I stood a long while with
my hands still clasped as I had spoken; then the cold of the night laid
hold upon me with a shudder, and I think my reason reawakened.

“You can make no hand of this, Davie,” thinks I. “To bed with you like
a wise lad, and try if you can sleep. To-morrow you may see your way.”




CHAPTER XXV.
THE RETURN OF JAMES MORE


I was called on the morrow out of a late and troubled slumber by a
knocking on my door, ran to open it, and had almost swooned with the
contrariety of my feelings, mostly painful; for on the threshold, in a
rough wraprascal and an extraordinary big laced hat, there stood James
More.

I ought to have been glad perhaps without admixture, for there was a
sense in which the man came like an answer to prayer. I had been saying
till my head was weary that Catriona and I must separate, and looking
till my head ached for any possible means of separation. Here were the
means come to me upon two legs, and joy was the hindmost of my
thoughts. It is to be considered, however, that even if the weight of
the future were lifted off me by the man’s arrival, the present heaved
up the more black and menacing; so that, as I first stood before him in
my shirt and breeches, I believe I took a leaping step backward like a
person shot.

“Ah,” said he, “I have found you, Mr. Balfour.” And offered me his
large, fine hand, the which (recovering at the same time my post in the
doorway, as if with some thought of resistance) I took him by
doubtfully. “It is a remarkable circumstance how our affairs appear to
intermingle,” he continued. “I am owing you an apology for an
unfortunate intrusion upon yours, which I suffered myself to be
entrapped into by my confidence in that false-face, Prestongrange; I
think shame to own to you that I was ever trusting to a lawyer.” He
shrugged his shoulders with a very French air. “But indeed the man is
very plausible,” says he. “And now it seems that you have busied
yourself handsomely in the matter of my daughter, for whose direction I
was remitted to yourself.”

“I think, sir,” said I, with a very painful air, “that it will be
necessary we two should have an explanation.”

“There is nothing amiss?” he asked. “My agent, Mr. Sprott—”

“For God’s sake moderate your voice!” I cried. “She must not hear till
we have had an explanation.”

“She is in this place?” cries he.

“That is her chamber door,” said I.

“You are here with her alone?” he asked.

“And who else would I have got to stay with us?” cries I.

I will do him the justice to admit that he turned pale.

“This is very unusual,” said he. “This is a very unusual circumstance.
You are right, we must hold an explanation.”

So saying he passed me by, and I must own the tall old rogue appeared
at that moment extraordinary dignified. He had now, for the first time,
the view of my chamber, which I scanned (I may say) with his eyes. A
bit of morning sun glinted in by the window pane, and showed it off; my
bed, my mails, and washing dish, with some disorder of my clothes, and
the unlighted chimney, made the only plenishing; no mistake but it
looked bare and cold, and the most unsuitable, beggarly place
conceivable to harbour a young lady. At the same time came in on my
mind the recollection of the clothes that I had bought for her; and I
thought this contrast of poverty and prodigality bore an ill
appearance.

He looked all about the chamber for a seat, and finding nothing else to
his purpose except my bed, took a place upon the side of it; where,
after I had closed the door, I could not very well avoid joining him.
For however this extraordinary interview might end, it must pass if
possible without waking Catriona; and the one thing needful was that we
should sit close and talk low. But I can scarce picture what a pair we
made; he in his great coat which the coldness of my chamber made
extremely suitable; I shivering in my shirt and breeks; he with very
much the air of a judge; and I (whatever I looked) with very much the
feelings of a man who has heard the last trumpet.

“Well?” says he.

And “Well,” I began, but found myself unable to go further.

“You tell me she is here?” said he again, but now with a spice of
impatience that seemed to brace me up.

“She is in this house,” said I, “and I knew the circumstance would be
called unusual. But you are to consider how very unusual the whole
business was from the beginning. Here is a young lady landed on the
coast of Europe with two shillings and a penny halfpenny. She is
directed to yon man Sprott in Helvoet. I hear you call him your agent.
All I can say is he could do nothing but damn and swear at the mere
mention of your name, and I must fee him out of my own pocket even to
receive the custody of her effects. You speak of unusual circumstances,
Mr. Drummond, if that be the name you prefer. Here was a circumstance,
if you like, to which it was barbarity to have exposed her.”

“But this is what I cannot understand the least,” said James. “My
daughter was placed into the charge of some responsible persons, whose
names I have forgot.”

“Gebbie was the name,” said I; “and there is no doubt that Mr. Gebbie
should have gone ashore with her at Helvoet. But he did not, Mr.
Drummond; and I think you might praise God that I was there to offer in
his place.”

“I shall have a word to say to Mr. Gebbie before long,” said he. “As
for yourself, I think it might have occurred that you were somewhat
young for such a post.”

“But the choice was not between me and somebody else, it was between me
and nobody,” cried I. “Nobody offered in my place, and I must say I
think you show a very small degree of gratitude to me that did.”

“I shall wait until I understand my obligation a little more in the
particular,” says he.

“Indeed, and I think it stares you in the face, then,” said I. “Your
child was deserted, she was clean flung away in the midst of Europe,
with scarce two shillings, and not two words of any language spoken
there: I must say, a bonny business! I brought her to this place. I
gave her the name and the tenderness due to a sister. All this has not
gone without expense, but that I scarce need to hint at. They were
services due to the young lady’s character which I respect; and I think
it would be a bonny business too, if I was to be singing her praises to
her father.”

“You are a young man,” he began.

“So I hear you tell me,” said I, with a good deal of heat.

“You are a very young man,” he repeated, “or you would have understood
the significancy of the step.”

“I think you speak very much at your ease,” cried I. “What else was I
to do? It is a fact I might have hired some decent, poor woman to be a
third to us, and I declare I never thought of it until this moment! But
where was I to find her, that am a foreigner myself? And let me point
out to your observation, Mr. Drummond, that it would have cost me money
out of my pocket. For here is just what it comes to, that I had to pay
through the nose for your neglect; and there is only the one story to
it, just that you were so unloving and so careless as to have lost your
daughter.”

“He that lives in a glass house should not be casting stones,” says he;
“and we will finish inquiring into the behaviour of Miss Drummond
before we go on to sit in judgment on her father.”

“But I will be entrapped into no such attitude,” said I. “The character
of Miss Drummond is far above inquiry, as her father ought to know. So
is mine, and I am telling you that. There are but the two ways of it
open. The one is to express your thanks to me as one gentleman to
another, and to say no more. The other (if you are so difficult as to
be still dissatisfied) is to pay me, that which I have expended and be
done.”

He seemed to soothe me with a hand in the air. “There, there,” said he.
“You go too fast, you go too fast, Mr. Balfour. It is a good thing that
I have learned to be more patient. And I believe you forget that I have
yet to see my daughter.”

I began to be a little relieved upon this speech and a change in the
man’s manner that I spied in him as soon as the name of money fell
between us.

“I was thinking it would be more fit—if you will excuse the plainness
of my dressing in your presence—that I should go forth and leave you to
encounter her alone?” said I.

“What I would have looked for at your hands!” says he; and there was no
mistake but what he said it civilly.

I thought this better and better still, and as I began to pull on my
hose, recalling the man’s impudent mendicancy at Prestongrange’s, I
determined to pursue what seemed to be my victory.

“If you have any mind to stay some while in Leyden,” said I, “this room
is very much at your disposal, and I can easy find another for myself:
in which way we shall have the least amount of flitting possible, there
being only one to change.”

“Why, sir,” said he, making his bosom big, “I think no shame of a
poverty I have come by in the service of my king; I make no secret that
my affairs are quite involved; and for the moment, it would be even
impossible for me to undertake a journey.”

“Until you have occasion to communicate with your friends,” said I,
“perhaps it might be convenient for you (as of course it would be
honourable to myself) if you were to regard yourself in the light of my
guest?”

“Sir,” said he, “when an offer is frankly made, I think I honour myself
most to imitate that frankness. Your hand, Mr. David; you have the
character that I respect the most; you are one of those from whom a
gentleman can take a favour and no more words about it. I am an old
soldier,” he went on, looking rather disgusted-like around my chamber,
“and you need not fear I shall prove burthensome. I have ate too often
at a dyke-side, drank of the ditch, and had no roof but the rain.”

“I should be telling you,” said I, “that our breakfasts are sent
customarily in about this time of morning. I propose I should go now to
the tavern, and bid them add a cover for yourself and delay the meal
the matter of an hour, which will give you an interval to meet your
daughter in.”

Methought his nostrils wagged at this. “O, an hour?” says he. “That is
perhaps superfluous. Half an hour, Mr. David, or say twenty minutes; I
shall do very well in that. And by the way,” he adds, detaining me by
the coat, “what is it you drink in the morning, whether ale or wine?”

“To be frank with you, sir,” says I, “I drink nothing else but spare,
cold water.”

“Tut-tut,” says he, “that is fair destruction to the stomach, take an
old campaigner’s word for it. Our country spirit at home is perhaps the
most entirely wholesome; but as that is not come-at-able, Rhenish or a
white wine of Burgundy will be next best.”

“I shall make it my business to see you are supplied,” said I.

“Why, very good,” said he, “and we shall make a man of you yet, Mr.
David.”

By this time, I can hardly say that I was minding him at all, beyond an
odd thought of the kind of father-in-law that he was like to prove; and
all my cares centred about the lass his daughter, to whom I determined
to convey some warning of her visitor. I stepped to the door
accordingly, and cried through the panels, knocking thereon at the same
time: “Miss Drummond, here is your father come at last.”

With that I went forth upon my errand, having (by two words)
extraordinarily damaged my affairs.




CHAPTER XXVI.
THE THREESOME


Whether or not I was to be so much blamed, or rather perhaps pitied, I
must leave others to judge. My shrewdness (of which I have a good deal,
too) seems not so great with the ladies. No doubt, at the moment when I
awaked her, I was thinking a good deal of the effect upon James More;
and similarly when I returned and we were all sat down to breakfast, I
continued to behave to the young lady with deference and distance; as I
still think to have been most wise. Her father had cast doubts upon the
innocence of my friendship; and these, it was my first business to
allay. But there is a kind of an excuse for Catriona also. We had
shared in a scene of some tenderness and passion, and given and
received caresses: I had thrust her from me with violence; I had called
aloud upon her in the night from the one room to the other; she had
passed hours of wakefulness and weeping; and it is not to be supposed I
had been absent from her pillow thoughts. Upon the back of this, to be
awaked, with unaccustomed formality, under the name of Miss Drummond,
and to be thenceforth used with a great deal of distance and respect,
led her entirely in error on my private sentiments; and she was indeed
so incredibly abused as to imagine me repentant and trying to draw off!

The trouble betwixt us seems to have been this: that whereas I (since I
had first set eyes on his great hat) thought singly of James More, his
return and suspicions, she made so little of these that I may say she
scarce remarked them, and all her troubles and doings regarded what had
passed between us in the night before. This is partly to be explained
by the innocence and boldness of her character; and partly because
James More, having sped so ill in his interview with me, or had his
mouth closed by my invitation, said no word to her upon the subject. At
the breakfast, accordingly, it soon appeared we were at cross purposes.
I had looked to find her in clothes of her own: I found her (as if her
father were forgotten) wearing some of the best that I had bought for
her, and which she knew (or thought) that I admired her in. I had
looked to find her imitate my affectation of distance, and be most
precise and formal; instead I found her flushed and wild-like, with
eyes extraordinary bright, and a painful and varying expression,
calling me by name with a sort of appeal of tenderness, and referring
and deferring to my thoughts and wishes like an anxious or a suspected
wife.

But this was not for long. As I behold her so regardless of her own
interests, which I had jeopardised and was now endeavouring to recover,
I redoubled my own coldness in the manner of a lesson to the girl. The
more she came forward, the farther I drew back; the more she betrayed
the closeness of our intimacy, the more pointedly civil I became, until
even her father (if he had not been so engrossed with eating) might
have observed the opposition. In the midst of which, of a sudden, she
became wholly changed, and I told myself, with a good deal of relief,
that she had took the hint at last.

All day I was at my classes or in quest of my new lodging; and though
the hour of our customary walk hung miserably on my hands, I cannot say
but I was happy on the whole to find my way cleared, the girl again in
proper keeping, the father satisfied or at least acquiescent, and
myself free to prosecute my love with honour. At supper, as at all our
meals, it was James More that did the talking. No doubt but he talked
well if anyone could have believed him. But I will speak of him
presently more at large. The meal at an end, he rose, got his great
coat, and looking (as I thought) at me, observed he had affairs abroad.
I took this for a hint that I was to be going also, and got up;
whereupon the girl, who had scarce given me greeting at my entrance,
turned her eyes upon me wide open with a look that bade me stay. I
stood between them like a fish out of water, turning from one to the
other; neither seemed to observe me, she gazing on the floor, he
buttoning his coat: which vastly swelled my embarrassment. This
appearance of indifference argued, upon her side, a good deal of anger
very near to burst out. Upon his, I thought it horribly alarming; I
made sure there was a tempest brewing there; and considering that to be
the chief peril, turned towards him and put myself (so to speak) in the
man’s hands.

“Can I do anything for _you_, Mr. Drummond?” says I.

He stifled a yawn, which again I thought to be duplicity. “Why, Mr.
David,” said he, “since you are so obliging as to propose it, you might
show me the way to a certain tavern” (of which he gave the name) “where
I hope to fall in with some old companions in arms.”

There was no more to say, and I got my hat and cloak to bear him
company.

“And as for you,” say he to his daughter, “you had best go to your bed.
I shall be late home, and _Early to bed and early to rise_, _gars bonny
lasses have bright eyes_.”

Whereupon he kissed her with a good deal of tenderness, and ushered me
before him from the door. This was so done (I thought on purpose) that
it was scarce possible there should be any parting salutation; but I
observed she did not look at me, and set it down to terror of James
More.

It was some distance to that tavern. He talked all the way of matters
which did not interest me the smallest, and at the door dismissed me
with empty manners. Thence I walked to my new lodging, where I had not
so much as a chimney to hold me warm, and no society but my own
thoughts. These were still bright enough; I did not so much as dream
that Catriona was turned against me; I thought we were like folk
pledged; I thought we had been too near and spoke too warmly to be
severed, least of all by what were only steps in a most needful policy.
And the chief of my concern was only the kind of father-in-law that I
was getting, which was not at all the kind I would have chosen: and the
matter of how soon I ought to speak to him, which was a delicate point
on several sides. In the first place, when I thought how young I was I
blushed all over, and could almost have found it in my heart to have
desisted; only that if once I let them go from Leyden without
explanation, I might lose her altogether. And in the second place,
there was our very irregular situation to be kept in view, and the
rather scant measure of satisfaction I had given James More that
morning. I concluded, on the whole, that delay would not hurt anything,
yet I would not delay too long neither; and got to my cold bed with a
full heart.

The next day, as James More seemed a little on the complaining hand in
the matter of my chamber, I offered to have in more furniture; and
coming in the afternoon, with porters bringing chairs and tables, found
the girl once more left to herself. She greeted me on my admission
civilly, but withdrew at once to her own room, of which she shut the
door. I made my disposition, and paid and dismissed the men so that she
might hear them go, when I supposed she would at once come forth again
to speak to me. I waited yet awhile, then knocked upon her door.

“Catriona!” said I.

The door was opened so quickly, even before I had the word out, that I
thought she must have stood behind it listening. She remained there in
the interval quite still; but she had a look that I cannot put a name
on, as of one in a bitter trouble.

“Are we not to have our walk to-day either?” so I faltered.

“I am thanking you,” said she. “I will not be caring much to walk, now
that my father is come home.”

“But I think he has gone out himself and left you here alone,” said I.

“And do you think that was very kindly said?” she asked.

“It was not unkindly meant,” I replied. “What ails you, Catriona? What
have I done to you that you should turn from me like this?”

“I do not turn from you at all,” she said, speaking very carefully. “I
will ever be grateful to my friend that was good to me; I will ever be
his friend in all that I am able. But now that my father James More is
come again, there is a difference to be made, and I think there are
some things said and done that would be better to be forgotten. But I
will ever be your friend in all that I am able, and if that is not all
that . . . . if it is not so much . . . . Not that you will be caring!
But I would not have you think of me too hard. It was true what you
said to me, that I was too young to be advised, and I am hoping you
will remember I was just a child. I would not like to lose your
friendship, at all events.”

She began this very pale; but before she was done, the blood was in her
face like scarlet, so that not her words only, but her face and the
trembling of her very hands, besought me to be gentle. I saw, for the
first time, how very wrong I had done to place the child in that
position, where she had been entrapped into a moment’s weakness, and
now stood before me like a person shamed.

“Miss Drummond,” I said, and stuck, and made the same beginning once
again, “I wish you could see into my heart,” I cried. “You would read
there that my respect is undiminished. If that were possible, I should
say it was increased. This is but the result of the mistake we made;
and had to come; and the less said of it now the better. Of all of our
life here, I promise you it shall never pass my lips; I would like to
promise you too that I would never think of it, but it’s a memory that
will be always dear to me. And as for a friend, you have one here that
would die for you.”

“I am thanking you,” said she.

We stood awhile silent, and my sorrow for myself began to get the upper
hand; for here were all my dreams come to a sad tumble, and my love
lost, and myself alone again in the world as at the beginning.

“Well,” said I, “we shall be friends always, that’s a certain thing.
But this is a kind of farewell, too: it’s a kind of a farewell after
all; I shall always ken Miss Drummond, but this is a farewell to my
Catriona.”

I looked at her; I could hardly say I saw her, but she seemed to grow
great and brighten in my eyes; and with that I suppose I must have lost
my head, for I called out her name again and made a step at her with my
hands reached forth.

She shrank back like a person struck, her face flamed; but the blood
sprang no faster up into her cheeks, than what it flowed back upon my
own heart, at sight of it, with penitence and concern. I found no words
to excuse myself, but bowed before her very deep, and went my ways out
of the house with death in my bosom.

I think it was about five days that followed without any change. I saw
her scarce ever but at meals, and then of course in the company of
James More. If we were alone even for a moment, I made it my devoir to
behave the more distantly and to multiply respectful attentions, having
always in my mind’s eye that picture of the girl shrinking and flaming
in a blush, and in my heart more pity for her than I could depict in
words. I was sorry enough for myself, I need not dwell on that, having
fallen all my length and more than all my height in a few seconds; but,
indeed, I was near as sorry for the girl, and sorry enough to be scarce
angry with her save by fits and starts. Her plea was good; she had been
placed in an unfair position; if she had deceived herself and me, it
was no more than was to have been looked for.

And for another thing she was now very much alone. Her father, when he
was by, was rather a caressing parent; but he was very easy led away by
his affairs and pleasures, neglected her without compunction or remark,
spent his nights in taverns when he had the money, which was more often
than I could at all account for; and even in the course of these few
days, failed once to come to a meal, which Catriona and I were at last
compelled to partake of without him. It was the evening meal, and I
left immediately that I had eaten, observing I supposed she would
prefer to be alone; to which she agreed and (strange as it may seem) I
quite believed her. Indeed, I thought myself but an eyesore to the
girl, and a reminder of a moment’s weakness that she now abhorred to
think of. So she must sit alone in that room where she and I had been
so merry, and in the blink of that chimney whose light had shone upon
our many difficult and tender moments. There she must sit alone, and
think of herself as of a maid who had most unmaidenly proffered her
affections and had the same rejected. And in the meanwhile I would be
alone some other place, and reading myself (whenever I was tempted to
be angry) lessons upon human frailty and female delicacy. And
altogether I suppose there were never two poor fools made themselves
more unhappy in a greater misconception.

As for James, he paid not so much heed to us, or to anything in nature
but his pocket, and his belly, and his own prating talk. Before twelve
hours were gone he had raised a small loan of me; before thirty, he had
asked for a second and been refused. Money and refusal he took with the
same kind of high good nature. Indeed, he had an outside air of
magnanimity that was very well fitted to impose upon a daughter; and
the light in which he was constantly presented in his talk, and the
man’s fine presence and great ways went together pretty harmoniously.
So that a man that had no business with him, and either very little
penetration or a furious deal of prejudice, might almost have been
taken in. To me, after my first two interviews, he was as plain as
print; I saw him to be perfectly selfish, with a perfect innocency in
the same; and I would hearken to his swaggering talk (of arms, and “an
old soldier,” and “a poor Highland gentleman,” and “the strength of my
country and my friends”) as I might to the babbling of a parrot.

The odd thing was that I fancy he believed some part of it himself, or
did at times; I think he was so false all through that he scarce knew
when he was lying; and for one thing, his moments of dejection must
have been wholly genuine. There were times when he would be the most
silent, affectionate, clinging creature possible, holding Catriona’s
hand like a big baby, and begging of me not to leave if I had any love
to him; of which, indeed, I had none, but all the more to his daughter.
He would press and indeed beseech us to entertain him with our talk, a
thing very difficult in the state of our relations; and again break
forth in pitiable regrets for his own land and friends, or into Gaelic
singing.

“This is one of the melancholy airs of my native land,” he would say.
“You may think it strange to see a soldier weep, and indeed it is to
make a near friend of you,” says he. “But the notes of this singing are
in my blood, and the words come out of my heart. And when I mind upon
my red mountains and the wild birds calling there, and the brave
streams of water running down, I would scarce think shame to weep
before my enemies.” Then he would sing again, and translate to me
pieces of the song, with a great deal of boggling and much expressed
contempt against the English language. “It says here,” he would say,
“that the sun is gone down, and the battle is at an end, and the brave
chiefs are defeated. And it tells here how the stars see them fleeing
into strange countries or lying dead on the red mountain; and they will
never more shout the call of battle or wash their feet in the streams
of the valley. But if you had only some of this language, you would
weep also because the words of it are beyond all expression, and it is
mere mockery to tell you it in English.”

Well, I thought there was a good deal of mockery in the business, one
way and another; and yet, there was some feeling too, for which I hated
him, I think, the worst of all. And it used to cut me to the quick to
see Catriona so much concerned for the old rogue, and weeping herself
to see him weep, when I was sure one half of his distress flowed from
his last night’s drinking in some tavern. There were times when I was
tempted to lend him a round sum, and see the last of him for good; but
this would have been to see the last of Catriona as well, for which I
was scarcely so prepared; and besides, it went against my conscience to
squander my good money on one who was so little of a husband.




CHAPTER XXVII.
A TWOSOME


I believe it was about the fifth day, and I know at least that James
was in one of his fits of gloom, when I received three letters. The
first was from Alan, offering to visit me in Leyden; the other two were
out of Scotland and prompted by the same affair, which was the death of
my uncle and my own complete accession to my rights. Rankeillor’s was,
of course, wholly in the business view; Miss Grant’s was like herself,
a little more witty than wise, full of blame to me for not having
written (though how was I to write with such intelligence?) and of
rallying talk about Catriona, which it cut me to the quick to read in
her very presence.

For it was of course in my own rooms that I found them, when I came to
dinner, so that I was surprised out of my news in the very first moment
of reading it. This made a welcome diversion for all three of us, nor
could any have foreseen the ill consequences that ensued. It was
accident that brought the three letters the same day, and that gave
them into my hand in the same room with James More; and of all the
events that flowed from that accident, and which I might have prevented
if I had held my tongue, the truth is that they were preordained before
Agricola came into Scotland or Abraham set out upon his travels.

The first that I opened was naturally Alan’s; and what more natural
than that I should comment on his design to visit me? but I observed
James to sit up with an air of immediate attention.

“Is that not Alan Breck that was suspected of the Appin accident?” he
inquired.

I told him, “Ay,” it was the same; and he withheld me some time from my
other letters, asking of our acquaintance, of Alan’s manner of life in
France, of which I knew very little, and further of his visit as now
proposed.

“All we forfeited folk hang a little together,” he explained, “and
besides I know the gentleman: and though his descent is not the thing,
and indeed he has no true right to use the name of Stewart, he was very
much admired in the day of Drummossie. He did there like a soldier; if
some that need not be named had done as well, the upshot need not have
been so melancholy to remember. There were two that did their best that
day, and it makes a bond between the pair of us,” says he.

I could scarce refrain from shooting out my tongue at him, and could
almost have wished that Alan had been there to have inquired a little
further into that mention of his birth. Though, they tell me, the same
was indeed not wholly regular.

Meanwhile, I had opened Miss Grant’s, and could not withhold an
exclamation.

“Catriona,” I cried, forgetting, the first time since her father was
arrived, to address her by a handle, “I am come into my kingdom fairly,
I am the laird of Shaws indeed—my uncle is dead at last.”

She clapped her hands together leaping from her seat. The next moment
it must have come over both of us at once what little cause of joy was
left to either, and we stood opposite, staring on each other sadly.

But James showed himself a ready hypocrite. “My daughter,” says he, “is
this how my cousin learned you to behave? Mr. David has lost a new
friend, and we should first condole with him on his bereavement.”

“Troth, sir,” said I, turning to him in a kind of anger, “I can make no
such great faces. His death is as blithe news as ever I got.”

“It’s a good soldier’s philosophy,” says James. “’Tis the way of flesh,
we must all go, all go. And if the gentleman was so far from your
favour, why, very well! But we may at least congratulate you on your
accession to your estates.”

“Nor can I say that either,” I replied, with the same heat. “It is a
good estate; what matters that to a lone man that has enough already? I
had a good revenue before in my frugality; and but for the man’s
death—which gratifies me, shame to me that must confess it!—I see not
how anyone is to be bettered by this change.”

“Come, come,” said he, “you are more affected than you let on, or you
would never make yourself out so lonely. Here are three letters; that
means three that wish you well; and I could name two more, here in this
very chamber. I have known you not so very long, but Catriona, when we
are alone, is never done with the singing of your praises.”

She looked up at him, a little wild at that; and he slid off at once
into another matter, the extent of my estate, which (during the most of
the dinner time) he continued to dwell upon with interest. But it was
to no purpose he dissembled; he had touched the matter with too gross a
hand: and I knew what to expect. Dinner was scarce ate when he plainly
discovered his designs. He reminded Catriona of an errand, and bid her
attend to it. “I do not see you should be one beyond the hour,” he
added, “and friend David will be good enough to bear me company till
you return.” She made haste to obey him without words. I do not know if
she understood, I believe not; but I was completely satisfied, and sat
strengthening my mind for what should follow.

The door had scarce closed behind her departure, when the man leaned
back in his chair and addressed me with a good affectation of easiness.
Only the one thing betrayed him, and that was his face; which suddenly
shone all over with fine points of sweat.

“I am rather glad to have a word alone with you,” says he, “because in
our first interview there were some expressions you misapprehended and
I have long meant to set you right upon. My daughter stands beyond
doubt. So do you, and I would make that good with my sword against all
gainsayers. But, my dear David, this world is a censorious place—as who
should know it better than myself, who have lived ever since the days
of my late departed father, God sain him! in a perfect spate of
calumnies? We have to face to that; you and me have to consider of
that; we have to consider of that.” And he wagged his head like a
minister in a pulpit.

“To what effect, Mr. Drummond?” said I. “I would be obliged to you if
you would approach your point.”

“Ay, ay,” said he, laughing, “like your character, indeed! and what I
most admire in it. But the point, my worthy fellow, is sometimes in a
kittle bit.” He filled a glass of wine. “Though between you and me,
that are such fast friends, it need not bother us long. The point, I
need scarcely tell you, is my daughter. And the first thing is that I
have no thought in my mind of blaming you. In the unfortunate
circumstances, what could you do else? ’Deed, and I cannot tell.”

“I thank you for that,” said I, pretty close upon my guard.

“I have besides studied your character,” he went on; “your talents are
fair; you seem to have a moderate competence, which does no harm; and
one thing with another, I am very happy to have to announce to you that
I have decided on the latter of the two ways open.”

“I am afraid I am dull,” said I. “What ways are these?”

He bent his brows upon me formidably and uncrossed his legs. “Why,
sir,” says he, “I think I need scarce describe them to a gentleman of
your condition; either that I should cut your throat or that you should
marry my daughter.”

“You are pleased to be quite plain at last,” said I.

“And I believe I have been plain from the beginning!” cries he
robustiously. “I am a careful parent, Mr. Balfour; but I thank God, a
patient and deleeborate man. There is many a father, sir, that would
have hirsled you at once either to the altar or the field. My esteem
for your character—”

“Mr. Drummond,” I interrupted, “if you have any esteem for me at all, I
will beg of you to moderate your voice. It is quite needless to rowt at
a gentleman in the same chamber with yourself and lending you his best
attention.”

“Why, very true,” says he, with an immediate change. “And you must
excuse the agitations of a parent.”

“I understand you then,” I continued—“for I will take no note of your
other alternative, which perhaps it was a pity you let fall—I
understand you rather to offer me encouragement in case I should desire
to apply for your daughter’s hand?”

“It is not possible to express my meaning better,” said he, “and I see
we shall do well together.”

“That remains to be yet seen,” said I. “But so much I need make no
secret of, that I bear the lady you refer to the most tender affection,
and I could not fancy, even in a dream, a better fortune than to get
her.”

“I was sure of it, I felt certain of you, David,” he cried, and reached
out his hand to me.

I put it by. “You go too fast, Mr. Drummond,” said I. “There are
conditions to be made; and there is a difficulty in the path, which I
see not entirely how we shall come over. I have told you that, upon my
side, there is no objection to the marriage, but I have good reason to
believe there will be much on the young lady’s.”

“This is all beside the mark,” says he. “I will engage for her
acceptance.”

“I think you forget, Mr. Drummond,” said I, “that, even in dealing with
myself, you have been betrayed into two-three unpalatable expressions.
I will have none such employed to the young lady. I am here to speak
and think for the two of us; and I give you to understand that I would
no more let a wife be forced upon myself, than what I would let a
husband be forced on the young lady.”

He sat and glowered at me like one in doubt and a good deal of temper.

“So that is to be the way of it,” I concluded. “I will marry Miss
Drummond, and that blithely, if she is entirely willing. But if there
be the least unwillingness, as I have reason to fear—marry her will I
never.”

“Well well,” said he, “this is a small affair. As soon as she returns I
will sound her a bit, and hope to reassure you—”

But I cut in again. “Not a finger of you, Mr. Drummond, or I cry off,
and you can seek a husband to your daughter somewhere else,” said I.
“It is I that am to be the only dealer and the only judge. I shall
satisfy myself exactly; and none else shall anyways meddle—you the
least of all.”

“Upon my word, sir!” he exclaimed, “and who are you to be the judge?”

“The bridegroom, I believe,” said I.

“This is to quibble,” he cried. “You turn your back upon the fact. The
girl, my daughter, has no choice left to exercise. Her character is
gone.”

“And I ask your pardon,” said I, “but while this matter lies between
her and you and me, that is not so.”

“What security have I!” he cried. “Am I to let my daughter’s reputation
depend upon a chance?”

“You should have thought of all this long ago,” said I, “before you
were so misguided as to lose her; and not afterwards when it is quite
too late. I refuse to regard myself as any way accountable for your
neglect, and I will be browbeat by no man living. My mind is quite made
up, and come what may, I will not depart from it a hair’s breadth. You
and me are to sit here in company till her return: upon which, without
either word or look from you, she and I are to go forth again to hold
our talk. If she can satisfy me that she is willing to this step, I
will then make it; and if she cannot, I will not.”

He leaped out of his chair like a man stung. “I can spy your manœuvre,”
he cried; “you would work upon her to refuse!”

“Maybe ay, and maybe no,” said I. “That is the way it is to be,
whatever.”

“And if I refuse?” cries he.

“Then, Mr. Drummond, it will have to come to the throat-cutting,” said
I.

What with the size of the man, his great length of arm in which he came
near rivalling his father, and his reputed skill at weapons, I did not
use this word without trepidation, to say nothing at all of the
circumstance that he was Catriona’s father. But I might have spared
myself alarms. From the poorness of my lodging—he does not seem to have
remarked his daughter’s dresses, which were indeed all equally new to
him—and from the fact that I had shown myself averse to lend, he had
embraced a strong idea of my poverty. The sudden news of my estate
convinced him of his error, and he had made but the one bound of it on
this fresh venture, to which he was now so wedded, that I believe he
would have suffered anything rather than fall to the alternative of
fighting.

A little while longer he continued to dispute with me, until I hit upon
a word that silenced him.

“If I find you so averse to let me see the lady by herself,” said I, “I
must suppose you have very good grounds to think me in the right about
her unwillingness.”

He gabbled some kind of an excuse.

“But all this is very exhausting to both of our tempers,” I added, “and
I think we would do better to preserve a judicious silence.”

The which we did until the girl returned, and I must suppose would have
cut a very ridiculous figure had there been any there to view us.




CHAPTER XXVIII.
IN WHICH I AM LEFT ALONE


I opened the door to Catriona and stopped her on the threshold.

“Your father wishes us to take our walk,” said I.

She looked to James More, who nodded, and at that, like a trained
soldier, she turned to go with me.

We took one of our old ways, where we had gone often together, and been
more happy than I can tell of in the past. I came a half a step behind,
so that I could watch her unobserved. The knocking of her little shoes
upon the way sounded extraordinary pretty and sad; and I thought it a
strange moment that I should be so near both ends of it at once, and
walk in the midst between two destinies, and could not tell whether I
was hearing these steps for the last time, or whether the sound of them
was to go in and out with me till death should part us.

She avoided even to look at me, only walked before her, like one who
had a guess of what was coming. I saw I must speak soon before my
courage was run out, but where to begin I knew not. In this painful
situation, when the girl was as good as forced into my arms and had
already besought my forbearance, any excess of pressure must have
seemed indecent; yet to avoid it wholly would have a very cold-like
appearance. Between these extremes I stood helpless, and could have bit
my fingers; so that, when at last I managed to speak at all, it may be
said I spoke at random.

“Catriona,” said I, “I am in a very painful situation; or rather, so we
are both; and I would be a good deal obliged to you if you would
promise to let me speak through first of all, and not to interrupt me
till I have done.”

She promised me that simply.

“Well,” said I, “this that I have got to say is very difficult, and I
know very well I have no right to be saying it. After what passed
between the two of us last Friday, I have no manner of right. We have
got so ravelled up (and all by my fault) that I know very well the
least I could do is just to hold my tongue, which was what I intended
fully, and there was nothing further from my thoughts than to have
troubled you again. But, my dear, it has become merely necessary, and
no way by it. You see, this estate of mine has fallen in, which makes
of me rather a better match; and the—the business would not have quite
the same ridiculous-like appearance that it would before. Besides
which, it’s supposed that our affairs have got so much ravelled up (as
I was saying) that it would be better to let them be the way they are.
In my view, this part of the thing is vastly exagerate, and if I were
you I would not wear two thoughts on it. Only it’s right I should
mention the same, because there’s no doubt it has some influence on
James More. Then I think we were none so unhappy when we dwelt together
in this town before. I think we did pretty well together. If you would
look back, my dear—”

“I will look neither back nor forward,” she interrupted. “Tell me the
one thing: this is my father’s doing?”

“He approves of it,” said I. “He approved I that I should ask your hand
in marriage,” and was going on again with somewhat more of an appeal
upon her feelings; but she marked me not, and struck into the midst.

“He told you to!” she cried. “It is no sense denying it, you said
yourself that there was nothing farther from your thoughts. He told you
to.”

“He spoke of it the first, if that is what you mean,” I began.

She was walking ever the faster, and looking fain in front of her; but
at this she made a little noise in her head, and I thought she would
have run.

“Without which,” I went on, “after what you said last Friday, I would
never have been so troublesome as make the offer. But when he as good
as asked me, what was I to do?”

She stopped and turned round upon me.

“Well, it is refused at all events,” she cried, “and there will be an
end of that.”

And she began again to walk forward.

“I suppose I could expect no better,” said I, “but I think you might
try to be a little kind to me for the last end of it. I see not why you
should be harsh. I have loved you very well, Catriona—no harm that I
should call you so for the last time. I have done the best that I could
manage, I am trying the same still, and only vexed that I can do no
better. It is a strange thing to me that you can take any pleasure to
be hard to me.”

“I am not thinking of you,” she said, “I am thinking of that man, my
father.”

“Well, and that way, too!” said I. “I can be of use to you that way,
too; I will have to be. It is very needful, my dear, that we should
consult about your father; for the way this talk has gone, an angry man
will be James More.”

She stopped again. “It is because I am disgraced?” she asked.

“That is what he is thinking,” I replied, “but I have told you already
to make nought of it.”

“It will be all one to me,” she cried. “I prefer to be disgraced!”

I did not know very well what to answer, and stood silent.

There seemed to be something working in her bosom after that last cry;
presently she broke out, “And what is the meaning of all this? Why is
all this shame loundered on my head? How could you dare it, David
Balfour?”

“My dear,” said I, “what else was I to do?”

“I am not your dear,” she said, “and I defy you to be calling me these
words.”

“I am not thinking of my words,” said I. “My heart bleeds for you, Miss
Drummond. Whatever I may say, be sure you have my pity in your
difficult position. But there is just the one thing that I wish you
would bear in view, if it was only long enough to discuss it quietly;
for there is going to be a collieshangie when we two get home. Take my
word for it, it will need the two of us to make this matter end in
peace.”

“Ay,” said she. There sprang a patch of red in either of her cheeks.
“Was he for fighting you?” said she.

“Well, he was that,” said I.

She gave a dreadful kind of laugh. “At all events, it is complete!” she
cried. And then turning on me. “My father and I are a fine pair,” said
she, “but I am thanking the good God there will be somebody worse than
what we are. I am thanking the good God that he has let me see you so.
There will never be the girl made that will not scorn you.”

I had borne a good deal pretty patiently, but this was over the mark.

“You have no right to speak to me like that,” said I. “What have I done
but to be good to you, or try to be? And here is my repayment! O, it is
too much.”

She kept looking at me with a hateful smile. “Coward!” said she.

“The word in your throat and in your father’s!” I cried. “I have dared
him this day already in your interest. I will dare him again, the nasty
pole-cat; little I care which of us should fall! Come,” said I, “back
to the house with us; let us be done with it, let me be done with the
whole Hieland crew of you! You will see what you think when I am dead.”

She shook her head at me with that same smile I could have struck her
for.

“O, smile away!” I cried. “I have seen your bonny father smile on the
wrong side this day. Not that I mean he was afraid, of course,” I added
hastily, “but he preferred the other way of it.”

“What is this?” she asked.

“When I offered to draw with him,” said I.

“You offered to draw upon James More!” she cried.

“And I did so,” said I, “and found him backward enough, or how would we
be here?”

“There is a meaning upon this,” said she. “What is it you are meaning?”

“He was to make you take me,” I replied, “and I would not have it. I
said you should be free, and I must speak with you alone; little I
supposed it would be such a speaking! ‘_And what if I refuse_?’ said
he.—‘_Then it must come to the throat-cutting_,’ says I, ‘_for I will
no more have a husband forced on that young lady_, _than what I would
have a wife forced upon myself_.’ These were my words, they were a
friend’s words; bonnily have I paid for them! Now you have refused me
of your own clear free will, and there lives no father in the
Highlands, or out of them, that can force on this marriage. I will see
that your wishes are respected; I will make the same my business, as I
have all through. But I think you might have that decency as to affect
some gratitude. ’Deed, and I thought you knew me better! I have not
behaved quite well to you, but that was weakness. And to think me a
coward, and such a coward as that—O, my lass, there was a stab for the
last of it!”

“Davie, how would I guess?” she cried. “O, this is a dreadful business!
Me and mine,”—she gave a kind of a wretched cry at the word—“me and
mine are not fit to speak to you. O, I could be kneeling down to you in
the street, I could be kissing your hands for forgiveness!”

“I will keep the kisses I have got from you already,” cried I. “I will
keep the ones I wanted and that were something worth; I will not be
kissed in penitence.”

“What can you be thinking of this miserable girl?” says she.

“What I am trying to tell you all this while!” said I, “that you had
best leave me alone, whom you can make no more unhappy if you tried,
and turn your attention to James More, your father, with whom you are
like to have a queer pirn to wind.”

“O, that I must be going out into the world alone with such a man!” she
cried, and seemed to catch herself in with a great effort. “But trouble
yourself no more for that,” said she. “He does not know what kind of
nature is in my heart. He will pay me dear for this day of it; dear,
dear, will he pay.”

She turned, and began to go home and I to accompany her. At which she
stopped.

“I will be going alone,” she said. “It is alone I must be seeing him.”

Some little time I raged about the streets, and told myself I was the
worst used lad in Christendom. Anger choked me; it was all very well
for me to breathe deep; it seemed there was not air enough about Leyden
to supply me, and I thought I would have burst like a man at the bottom
of the sea. I stopped and laughed at myself at a street corner a minute
together, laughing out loud, so that a passenger looked at me, which
brought me to myself.

“Well,” I thought, “I have been a gull and a ninny and a soft Tommy
long enough. Time it was done. Here is a good lesson to have nothing to
do with that accursed sex, that was the ruin of the man in the
beginning and will be so to the end. God knows I was happy enough
before ever I saw her; God knows I can be happy enough again when I
have seen the last of her.”

That seemed to me the chief affair: to see them go. I dwelled upon the
idea fiercely; and presently slipped on, in a kind of malevolence, to
consider how very poorly they were likely to fare when Davie Balfour
was no longer by to be their milk-cow; at which, to my very own great
surprise, the disposition of my mind turned bottom up. I was still
angry; I still hated her; and yet I thought I owed it to myself that
she should suffer nothing.

This carried me home again at once, where I found the mails drawn out
and ready fastened by the door, and the father and daughter with every
mark upon them of a recent disagreement. Catriona was like a wooden
doll; James More breathed hard, his face was dotted with white spots,
and his nose upon one side. As soon as I came in, the girl looked at
him with a steady, clear, dark look that might have been followed by a
blow. It was a hint that was more contemptuous than a command, and I
was surprised to see James More accept it. It was plain he had had a
master talking-to; and I could see there must be more of the devil in
the girl than I had guessed, and more good humour about the man than I
had given him the credit of.

He began, at least, calling me Mr. Balfour, and plainly speaking from a
lesson; but he got not very far, for at the first pompous swell of his
voice, Catriona cut in.

“I will tell you what James More is meaning,” said she. “He means we
have come to you, beggar-folk, and have not behaved to you very well,
and we are ashamed of our ingratitude and ill-behaviour. Now we are
wanting to go away and be forgotten; and my father will have guided his
gear so ill, that we cannot even do that unless you will give us some
more alms. For that is what we are, at an events, beggar-folk and
sorners.”

“By your leave, Miss Drummond,” said I, “I must speak to your father by
myself.”

She went into her own room and shut the door, without a word or a look.

“You must excuse her, Mr. Balfour,” says James More. “She has no
delicacy.”

“I am not here to discuss that with you,” said I, “but to be quit of
you. And to that end I must talk of your position. Now, Mr. Drummond, I
have kept the run of your affairs more closely than you bargained for.
I know you had money of your own when you were borrowing mine. I know
you have had more since you were here in Leyden, though you concealed
it even from your daughter.”

“I bid you beware. I will stand no more baiting,” he broke out. “I am
sick of her and you. What kind of a damned trade is this to be a
parent! I have had expressions used to me—” There he broke off. “Sir,
this is the heart of a soldier and a parent,” he went on again, laying
his hand on his bosom, “outraged in both characters—and I bid you
beware.”

“If you would have let me finish,” says I, “you would have found I
spoke for your advantage.”

“My dear friend,” he cried, “I know I might have relied upon the
generosity of your character.”

“Man! will you let me speak?” said I. “The fact is that I cannot win to
find out if you are rich or poor. But it is my idea that your means, as
they are mysterious in their source, so they are something insufficient
in amount; and I do not choose your daughter to be lacking. If I durst
speak to herself, you may be certain I would never dream of trusting it
to you; because I know you like the back of my hand, and all your
blustering talk is that much wind to me. However, I believe in your way
you do still care something for your daughter after all; and I must
just be doing with that ground of confidence, such as it is.”

Whereupon, I arranged with him that he was to communicate with me, as
to his whereabouts and Catriona’s welfare, in consideration of which I
was to serve him a small stipend.

He heard the business out with a great deal of eagerness; and when it
was done, “My dear fellow, my dear son,” he cried out, “this is more
like yourself than any of it yet! I will serve you with a soldier’s
faithfulness—”

“Let me hear no more of it!” says I. “You have got me to that pitch
that the bare name of soldier rises on my stomach. Our traffic is
settled; I am now going forth and will return in one half-hour, when I
expect to find my chambers purged of you.”

I gave them good measure of time; it was my one fear that I might see
Catriona again, because tears and weakness were ready in my heart, and
I cherished my anger like a piece of dignity. Perhaps an hour went by;
the sun had gone down, a little wisp of a new moon was following it
across a scarlet sunset; already there were stars in the east, and in
my chambers, when at last I entered them, the night lay blue. I lit a
taper and reviewed the rooms; in the first there remained nothing so
much as to awake a memory of those who were gone; but in the second, in
a corner of the floor, I spied a little heap that brought my heart into
my mouth. She had left behind at her departure all that she had ever
had of me. It was the blow that I felt sorest, perhaps because it was
the last; and I fell upon that pile of clothing and behaved myself more
foolish than I care to tell of.

Late in the night, in a strict frost, and my teeth chattering, I came
again by some portion of my manhood and considered with myself. The
sight of these poor frocks and ribbons, and her shifts, and the clocked
stockings, was not to be endured; and if I were to recover any
constancy of mind, I saw I must be rid of them ere the morning. It was
my first thought to have made a fire and burned them; but my
disposition has always been opposed to wastery, for one thing; and for
another, to have burned these things that she had worn so close upon
her body seemed in the nature of a cruelty. There was a corner cupboard
in that chamber; there I determined to bestow them. The which I did and
made it a long business, folding them with very little skill indeed but
the more care; and sometimes dropping them with my tears. All the heart
was gone out of me, I was weary as though I had run miles, and sore
like one beaten; when, as I was folding a kerchief that she wore often
at her neck, I observed there was a corner neatly cut from it. It was a
kerchief of a very pretty hue, on which I had frequently remarked; and
once that she had it on, I remembered telling her (by way of a banter)
that she wore my colours. There came a glow of hope and like a tide of
sweetness in my bosom; and the next moment I was plunged back in a
fresh despair. For there was the corner crumpled in a knot and cast
down by itself in another part of the floor.

But when I argued with myself, I grew more hopeful. She had cut that
corner off in some childish freak that was manifestly tender; that she
had cast it away again was little to be wondered at; and I was inclined
to dwell more upon the first than upon the second, and to be more
pleased that she had ever conceived the idea of that keepsake, than
concerned because she had flung it from her in an hour of natural
resentment.




CHAPTER XXIX.
WE MEET IN DUNKIRK


Altogether, then, I was scare so miserable the next days but what I had
many hopeful and happy snatches; threw myself with a good deal of
constancy upon my studies; and made out to endure the time till Alan
should arrive, or I might hear word of Catriona by the means of James
More. I had altogether three letters in the time of our separation. One
was to announce their arrival in the town of Dunkirk in France, from
which place James shortly after started alone upon a private mission.
This was to England and to see Lord Holderness; and it has always been
a bitter thought that my good money helped to pay the charges of the
same. But he has need of a long spoon who soups with the de’il, or
James More either. During this absence, the time was to fall due for
another letter; and as the letter was the condition of his stipend, he
had been so careful as to prepare it beforehand and leave it with
Catriona to be despatched. The fact of our correspondence aroused her
suspicions, and he was no sooner gone than she had burst the seal. What
I received began accordingly in the writing of James More:

“My dear Sir,—Your esteemed favour came to hand duly, and I have to
acknowledge the inclosure according to agreement. It shall be all
faithfully expended on my daughter, who is well, and desires to be
remembered to her dear friend. I find her in rather a melancholy
disposition, but trust in the mercy of God to see her re-established.
Our manner of life is very much alone, but we solace ourselves with the
melancholy tunes of our native mountains, and by walking up the margin
of the sea that lies next to Scotland. It was better days with me when
I lay with five wounds upon my body on the field of Gladsmuir. I have
found employment here in the _haras_ of a French nobleman, where my
experience is valued. But, my dear Sir, the wages are so exceedingly
unsuitable that I would be ashamed to mention them, which makes your
remittances the more necessary to my daughter’s comfort, though I
daresay the sight of old friends would be still better.


“My dear Sir,
“Your affectionate, obedient servant,
“James Macgregor Drummond.”


Below it began again in the hand of Catriona:—

“Do not be believing him, it is all lies together,—C. M. D.”


Not only did she add this postscript, but I think she must have come
near suppressing the letter; for it came long after date, and was
closely followed by the third. In the time betwixt them, Alan had
arrived, and made another life to me with his merry conversation; I had
been presented to his cousin of the Scots-Dutch, a man that drank more
than I could have thought possible and was not otherwise of interest; I
had been entertained to many jovial dinners and given some myself, all
with no great change upon my sorrow; and we two (by which I mean Alan
and myself, and not at all the cousin) had discussed a good deal the
nature of my relations with James More and his daughter. I was
naturally diffident to give particulars; and this disposition was not
anyway lessened by the nature of Alan’s commentary upon those I gave.

“I cannae make heed nor tail of it,” he would say, “but it sticks in my
mind ye’ve made a gowk of yourself. There’s few people that has had
more experience than Alan Breck: and I can never call to mind to have
heard tell of a lassie like this one of yours. The way that you tell
it, the thing’s fair impossible. Ye must have made a terrible hash of
the business, David.”

“There are whiles that I am of the same mind,” said I.

“The strange thing is that ye seem to have a kind of fancy for her
too!” said Alan.

“The biggest kind, Alan,” said I, “and I think I’ll take it to my grave
with me.”

“Well, ye beat me, whatever!” he would conclude.

I showed him the letter with Catriona’s postscript. “And here again!”
he cried. “Impossible to deny a kind of decency to this Catriona, and
sense forby! As for James More, the man’s as boss as a drum; he’s just
a wame and a wheen words; though I’ll can never deny that he fought
reasonably well at Gladsmuir, and it’s true what he says here about the
five wounds. But the loss of him is that the man’s boss.”

“Ye see, Alan,” said I, “it goes against the grain with me to leave the
maid in such poor hands.”

“Ye couldnae weel find poorer,” he admitted. “But what are ye to do
with it? It’s this way about a man and a woman, ye see, Davie: The
weemenfolk have got no kind of reason to them. Either they like the
man, and then a’ goes fine; or else they just detest him, and ye may
spare your breath—ye can do naething. There’s just the two sets of
them—them that would sell their coats for ye, and them that never look
the road ye’re on. That’s a’ that there is to women; and you seem to be
such a gomeral that ye cannae tell the tane frae the tither.”

“Well, and I’m afraid that’s true for me,” said I.

“And yet there’s naething easier!” cried Alan. “I could easy learn ye
the science of the thing; but ye seem to me to be born blind, and
there’s where the deefficulty comes in.”

“And can _you_ no help me?” I asked, “you that are so clever at the
trade?”

“Ye see, David, I wasnae here,” said he. “I’m like a field officer that
has naebody but blind men for scouts and _éclaireurs_; and what would
he ken? But it sticks in my mind that ye’ll have made some kind of
bauchle; and if I was you I would have a try at her again.”

“Would ye so, man Alan?” said I.

“I would e’en’t,” says he.

The third letter came to my hand while we were deep in some such talk:
and it will be seen how pat it fell to the occasion. James professed to
be in some concern upon his daughter’s health, which I believe was
never better; abounded in kind expressions to myself; and finally
proposed that I should visit them at Dunkirk.

“You will now be enjoying the society of my old comrade Mr. Stewart,”
he wrote. “Why not accompany him so far in his return to France? I have
something very particular for Mr. Stewart’s ear; and, at any rate, I
would be pleased to meet in with an old fellow-soldier and one so
mettle as himself. As for you, my dear sir, my daughter and I would be
proud to receive our benefactor, whom we regard as a brother and a son.
The French nobleman has proved a person of the most filthy avarice of
character, and I have been necessitate to leave the _haras_. You will
find us in consequence a little poorly lodged in the _auberge_ of a man
Bazin on the dunes; but the situation is caller, and I make no doubt
but we might spend some very pleasant days, when Mr. Stewart and I
could recall our services, and you and my daughter divert yourselves in
a manner more befitting your age. I beg at least that Mr. Stewart would
come here; my business with him opens a very wide door.”

“What does the man want with me?” cried Alan, when he had read. “What
he wants with you is clear enough—it’s siller. But what can he want
with Alan Breck?”

“O, it’ll be just an excuse,” said I. “He is still after this marriage,
which I wish from my heart that we could bring about. And he asks you
because he thinks I would be less likely to come wanting you.”

“Well, I wish that I kent,” says Alan. “Him and me were never onyways
pack; we used to girn at ither like a pair of pipers. ‘Something for my
ear,’ quo’ he! I’ll maybe have something for his hinder-end, before
we’re through with it. Dod, I’m thinking it would be a kind of
divertisement to gang and see what he’ll be after! Forby that I could
see your lassie then. What say ye, Davie? Will ye ride with Alan?”

You may be sure I was not backward, and Alan’s furlough running towards
an end, we set forth presently upon this joint adventure.

It was near dark of a January day when we rode at last into the town of
Dunkirk. We left our horses at the post, and found a guide to Bazin’s
Inn, which lay beyond the walls. Night was quite fallen, so that we
were the last to leave that fortress, and heard the doors of it close
behind us as we passed the bridge. On the other side there lay a
lighted suburb, which we thridded for a while, then turned into a dark
lane, and presently found ourselves wading in the night among deep sand
where we could hear a bullering of the sea. We travelled in this
fashion for some while, following our conductor mostly by the sound of
his voice; and I had begun to think he was perhaps misleading us, when
we came to the top of a small brae, and there appeared out of the
darkness a dim light in a window.

“_Voilà l’auberge à Bazin_,” says the guide.

Alan smacked his lips. “An unco lonely bit,” said he, and I thought by
his tone he was not wholly pleased.

A little after, and we stood in the lower storey of that house, which
was all in the one apartment, with a stairs leading to the chambers at
the side, benches and tables by the wall, the cooking fire at the one
end of it, and shelves of bottles and the cellar-trap at the other.
Here Bazin, who was an ill-looking, big man, told us the Scottish
gentleman was gone abroad he knew not where, but the young lady was
above, and he would call her down to us.

I took from my breast that kerchief wanting the corner, and knotted it
about my throat. I could hear my heart go; and Alan patting me on the
shoulder with some of his laughable expressions, I could scarce refrain
from a sharp word. But the time was not long to wait. I heard her step
pass overhead, and saw her on the stair. This she descended very
quietly, and greeted me with a pale face and a certain seeming of
earnestness, or uneasiness, in her manner that extremely dashed me.

“My father, James More, will be here soon. He will be very pleased to
see you,” she said. And then of a sudden her face flamed, her eyes
lightened, the speech stopped upon her lips; and I made sure she had
observed the kerchief. It was only for a breath that she was
discomposed; but methought it was with a new animation that she turned
to welcome Alan. “And you will be his friend, Alan Breck?” she cried.
“Many is the dozen times I will have heard him tell of you; and I love
you already for all your bravery and goodness.”

“Well, well,” says Alan, holding her hand in his and viewing her, “and
so this is the young lady at the last of it! David, ye’re an awful poor
hand of a description.”

I do not know that ever I heard him speak so straight to people’s
hearts; the sound of his voice was like song.

“What? will he have been describing me?” she cried.

“Little else of it since I ever came out of France!” says he, “forby a
bit of a speciment one night in Scotland in a shaw of wood by
Silvermills. But cheer up, my dear! ye’re bonnier than what he said.
And now there’s one thing sure; you and me are to be a pair of friends.
I’m a kind of a henchman to Davie here; I’m like a tyke at his heels;
and whatever he cares for, I’ve got to care for too—and by the holy
airn! they’ve got to care for me! So now you can see what way you stand
with Alan Breck, and ye’ll find ye’ll hardly lose on the transaction.
He’s no very bonnie, my dear, but he’s leal to them he loves.”

“I thank you from my heart for your good words,” said she. “I have that
honour for a brave, honest man that I cannot find any to be answering
with.”

Using travellers’ freedom, we spared to wait for James More, and sat
down to meat, we threesome. Alan had Catriona sit by him and wait upon
his wants: he made her drink first out of his glass, he surrounded her
with continual kind gallantries, and yet never gave me the most small
occasion to be jealous; and he kept the talk so much in his own hand,
and that in so merry a note, that neither she nor I remembered to be
embarrassed. If any had seen us there, it must have been supposed that
Alan was the old friend and I the stranger. Indeed, I had often cause
to love and to admire the man, but I never loved or admired him better
than that night; and I could not help remarking to myself (what I was
sometimes rather in danger of forgetting) that he had not only much
experience of life, but in his own way a great deal of natural ability
besides. As for Catriona, she seemed quite carried away; her laugh was
like a peal of bells, her face gay as a May morning; and I own,
although I was well pleased, yet I was a little sad also, and thought
myself a dull, stockish character in comparison of my friend, and very
unfit to come into a young maid’s life, and perhaps ding down her
gaiety.

But if that was like to be my part, I found that at least I was not
alone in it; for, James More returning suddenly, the girl was changed
into a piece of stone. Through the rest of that evening, until she made
an excuse and slipped to bed, I kept an eye upon her without cease; and
I can bear testimony that she never smiled, scarce spoke, and looked
mostly on the board in front of her. So that I really marvelled to see
so much devotion (as it used to be) changed into the very sickness of
hate.

Of James More it is unnecessary to say much; you know the man already,
what there was to know of him; and I am weary of writing out his lies.
Enough that he drank a great deal, and told us very little that was to
any possible purpose. As for the business with Alan, that was to be
reserved for the morrow and his private hearing.

It was the more easy to be put off, because Alan and I were pretty
weary with four day’s ride, and sat not very late after Catriona.

We were soon alone in a chamber where we were to make-shift with a
single bed. Alan looked on me with a queer smile.

“Ye muckle ass!” said he.

“What do ye mean by that?” I cried.

“Mean? What do I mean! It’s extraordinar, David man,” say he, “that you
should be so mortal stupit.”

Again I begged him to speak out.

“Well, it’s this of it,” said he. “I told ye there were the two kinds
of women—them that would sell their shifts for ye, and the others. Just
you try for yoursel, my bonny man! But what’s that neepkin at your
craig?”

I told him.

“I thocht it was something thereabout,” said he.

Nor would he say another word though I besieged him long with
importunities.




CHAPTER XXX.
THE LETTER FROM THE SHIP


Daylight showed us how solitary the inn stood. It was plainly hard upon
the sea, yet out of all view of it, and beset on every side with
scabbit hills of sand. There was, indeed, only one thing in the nature
of a prospect, where there stood out over a brae the two sails of a
windmill, like an ass’s ears, but with the ass quite hidden. It was
strange (after the wind rose, for at first it was dead calm) to see the
turning and following of each other of these great sails behind the
hillock. Scarce any road came by there; but a number of footways
travelled among the bents in all directions up to Mr. Bazin’s door. The
truth is, he was a man of many trades, not any one of them honest, and
the position of his inn was the best of his livelihood. Smugglers
frequented it; political agents and forfeited persons bound across the
water came there to await their passages; and I daresay there was worse
behind, for a whole family might have been butchered in that house and
nobody the wiser.

I slept little and ill. Long ere it was day, I had slipped from beside
my bedfellow, and was warming myself at the fire or walking to and fro
before the door. Dawn broke mighty sullen; but a little after, sprang
up a wind out of the west, which burst the clouds, let through the sun,
and set the mill to the turning. There was something of spring in the
sunshine, or else it was in my heart; and the appearing of the great
sails one after another from behind the hill, diverted me extremely. At
times I could hear a creak of the machinery; and by half-past eight of
the day, and I thought this dreary, desert place was like a paradise.

For all which, as the day drew on and nobody came near, I began to be
aware of an uneasiness that I could scarce explain. It seemed there was
trouble afoot; the sails of the windmill, as they came up and went down
over the hill, were like persons spying; and outside of all fancy, it
was surely a strange neighbourhood and house for a young lady to be
brought to dwell in.

At breakfast, which we took late, it was manifest that James More was
in some danger or perplexity; manifest that Alan was alive to the same,
and watched him close; and this appearance of duplicity upon the one
side, and vigilance upon the other, held me on live coals. The meal was
no sooner over than James seemed to come began to make apologies. He
had an appointment of a private nature in the town (it was with the
French nobleman, he told me), and we would please excuse him till about
noon. Meanwhile he carried his daughter aside to the far end of the
room, where he seemed to speak rather earnestly and she to listen with
much inclination.

“I am caring less and less about this man James,” said Alan. “There’s
something no right with the man James, and I shouldnae wonder but what
Alan Breck would give an eye to him this day. I would like fine to see
yon French nobleman, Davie; and I daresay you could find an employ to
yoursel, and that would be to speir at the lassie for some news o’ your
affair. Just tell it to her plainly—tell her ye’re a muckle ass at the
off-set; and then, if I were you, and ye could do it naitural, I would
just mint to her I was in some kind of a danger; a’ weemenfolk likes
that.”

“I cannae lee, Alan, I cannae do it naitural,” says I, mocking him.

“The more fool you!” says he. “Then ye’ll can tell her that I
recommended it; that’ll set her to the laughing; and I wouldnae wonder
but what that was the next best. But see to the pair of them! If I
didnae feel just sure of the lassie, and that she was awful pleased and
chief with Alan, I would think there was some kind of hocus-pocus about
you.”

“And is she so pleased with ye, then, Alan?” I asked.

“She thinks a heap of me,” says he. “And I’m no like you: I’m one that
can tell. That she does—she thinks a heap of Alan. And troth! I’m
thinking a good deal of him mysel; and with your permission, Shaws,
I’ll be getting a wee yont amang the bents, so that I can see what way
James goes.”

One after another went, till I was left alone beside the breakfast
table; James to Dunkirk, Alan dogging him, Catriona up the stairs to
her own chamber. I could very well understand how she should avoid to
be alone with me; yet was none the better pleased with it for that, and
bent my mind to entrap her to an interview before the men returned.
Upon the whole, the best appeared to me to do like Alan. If I was out
of view among the sandhills, the fine morning would decoy her forth;
and once I had her in the open, I could please myself.

No sooner said than done; nor was I long under the bield of a hillock
before she appeared at the inn door, looked here and there, and (seeing
nobody) set out by a path that led directly seaward, and by which I
followed her. I was in no haste to make my presence known; the further
she went I made sure of the longer hearing to my suit; and the ground
being all sandy it was easy to follow her unheard. The path rose and
came at last to the head of a knowe. Thence I had a picture for the
first time of what a desolate wilderness that inn stood hidden in;
where was no man to be seen, nor any house of man, except just Bazin’s
and the windmill. Only a little further on, the sea appeared and two or
three ships upon it, pretty as a drawing. One of these was extremely
close in to be so great a vessel; and I was aware of a shock of new
suspicion, when I recognised the trim of the _Seahorse_. What should an
English ship be doing so near in to France? Why was Alan brought into
her neighbourhood, and that in a place so far from any hope of rescue?
and was it by accident, or by design, that the daughter of James More
should walk that day to the seaside?

Presently I came forth behind her in the front of the sandhills and
above the beach. It was here long and solitary; with a man-o’-war’s
boat drawn up about the middle of the prospect, and an officer in
charge and pacing the sands like one who waited. I sat down where the
rough grass a good deal covered me, and looked for what should follow.
Catriona went straight to the boat; the officer met her with
civilities; they had ten words together; I saw a letter changing hands;
and there was Catriona returning. At the same time, as if this were all
her business on the Continent, the boat shoved off and was headed for
the _Seahorse_. But I observed the officer to remain behind and
disappear among the bents.

I liked the business little; and the more I considered of it, liked it
less. Was it Alan the officer was seeking? or Catriona? She drew near
with her head down, looking constantly on the sand, and made so tender
a picture that I could not bear to doubt her innocence. The next, she
raised her face and recognised me; seemed to hesitate, and then came on
again, but more slowly, and I thought with a changed colour. And at
that thought, all else that was upon my bosom—fears, suspicions, the
care of my friend’s life—was clean swallowed up; and I rose to my feet
and stood waiting her in a drunkenness of hope.

I gave her “good morning” as she came up, which she returned with a
good deal of composure.

“Will you forgive my having followed you?” said I.

“I know you are always meaning kindly,” she replied; and then, with a
little outburst, “but why will you be sending money to that man! It
must not be.”

“I never sent it for him,” said I, “but for you, as you know well.”

“And you have no right to be sending it to either one of us,” she said.
“David, it is not right.”

“It is not, it is all wrong,” said I, “and I pray God he will help this
dull fellow (if it be at all possible) to make it better. Catriona,
this is no kind of life for you to lead; and I ask your pardon for the
word, but yon man is no fit father to take care of you.”

“Do not be speaking of him, even!” was her cry.

“And I need speak of him no more; it is not of him that I am thinking,
O, be sure of that!” says I. “I think of the one thing. I have been
alone now this long time in Leyden; and when I was by way of at my
studies, still I was thinking of that. Next Alan came, and I went among
soldier-men to their big dinners; and still I had the same thought. And
it was the same before, when I had her there beside me. Catriona, do
you see this napkin at my throat! You cut a corner from it once and
then cast it from you. They’re _your_ colours now; I wear them in my
heart. My dear, I cannot be wanting you. O, try to put up with me!”

I stepped before her so as to intercept her walking on.

“Try to put up with me,” I was saying, “try and bear me with a little.”

Still she had never the word, and a fear began to rise in me like a
fear of death.

“Catriona,” I cried, gazing on her hard, “is it a mistake again? Am I
quite lost?”

She raised her face to me, breathless.

“Do you want me, Davie, truly?” said she, and I scarce could hear her
say it.

“I do that,” said I. “O, sure you know it—I do that.”

“I have nothing left to give or to keep back,” said she. “I was all
yours from the first day, if you would have had a gift of me!” she
said.

This was on the summit of a brae; the place was windy and conspicuous,
we were to be seen there even from the English ship; but I kneeled down
before her in the sand, and embraced her knees, and burst into that
storm of weeping that I thought it must have broken me. All thought was
wholly beaten from my mind by the vehemency of my discomposure. I knew
not where I was. I had forgot why I was happy; only I knew she stooped,
and I felt her cherish me to her face and bosom, and heard her words
out of a whirl.

“Davie,” she was saying, “O, Davie, is this what you think of me! Is it
so that you were caring for poor me! O, Davie, Davie!”

With that she wept also, and our tears were commingled in a perfect
gladness.

It might have been ten in the day before I came to a clear sense of
what a mercy had befallen me; and sitting over against her, with her
hands in mine, gazed in her face, and laughed out loud for pleasure
like a child, and called her foolish and kind names. I have never seen
the place that looked so pretty as those bents by Dunkirk; and the
windmill sails, as they bobbed over the knowe, were like a tune of
music.

I know not how much longer we might have continued to forget all else
besides ourselves, had I not chanced upon a reference to her father,
which brought us to reality.

“My little friend,” I was calling her again and again, rejoicing to
summon up the past by the sound of it, and to gaze across on her, and
to be a little distant—“My little friend, now you are mine altogether;
mine for good, my little friend and that man’s no longer at all.”

There came a sudden whiteness in her face, she plucked her hands from
mine.

“Davie, take me away from him!” she cried. “There’s something wrong;
he’s not true. There will be something wrong; I have a dreadful terror
here at my heart. What will he be wanting at all events with that
King’s ship? What will this word be saying?” And she held the letter
forth. “My mind misgives me, it will be some ill to Alan. Open it,
Davie—open it and see.”

I took it, and looked at it, and shook my head.

“No,” said I, “it goes against me, I cannot open a man’s letter.”

“Not to save your friend?” she cried.

“I cannae tell,” said I. “I think not. If I was only sure!”

“And you have but to break the seal!” said she.

“I know it,” said I, “but the thing goes against me.”

“Give it here,” said she, “and I will open it myself.”

“Nor you neither,” said I. “You least of all. It concerns your father,
and his honour, dear, which we are both misdoubting. No question but
the place is dangerous-like, and the English ship being here, and your
father having word from it, and yon officer that stayed ashore. He
would not be alone either; there must be more along with him; I daresay
we are spied upon this minute. Ay, no doubt, the letter should be
opened; but somehow, not by you nor me.”

I was about thus far with it, and my spirit very much overcome with a
sense of danger and hidden enemies, when I spied Alan, come back again
from following James and walking by himself among the sand-hills. He
was in his soldier’s coat, of course, and mighty fine; but I could not
avoid to shudder when I thought how little that jacket would avail him,
if he were once caught and flung in a skiff, and carried on board of
the _Seahorse_, a deserter, a rebel, and now a condemned murderer.

“There,” said I, “there is the man that has the best right to open it:
or not, as he thinks fit.”

With which I called upon his name, and we both stood up to be a mark
for him.

“If it is so—if it be more disgrace—will you can bear it?” she asked,
looking upon me with a burning eye.

“I was asked something of the same question when I had seen you but the
once,” said I. “What do you think I answered? That if I liked you as I
thought I did—and O, but I like you better!—I would marry you at his
gallows’ foot.”

The blood rose in her face; she came close up and pressed upon me,
holding my hand: and it was so that we awaited Alan.

He came with one of his queer smiles. “What was I telling ye, David?”
says he.

“There is a time for all things, Alan,” said I, “and this time is
serious. How have you sped? You can speak out plain before this friend
of ours.”

“I have been upon a fool’s errand,” said he.

“I doubt we have done better than you, then,” said I; “and, at least,
here is a great deal of matter that you must judge of. Do you see
that?” I went on, pointing to the ship. “That is the _Seahorse_,
Captain Palliser.”

“I should ken her, too,” says Alan. “I had fyke enough with her when
she was stationed in the Forth. But what ails the man to come so
close?”

“I will tell you why he came there first,” said I. “It was to bring
this letter to James More. Why he stops here now that it’s delivered,
what it’s likely to be about, why there’s an officer hiding in the
bents, and whether or not it’s probable that he’s alone—I would rather
you considered for yourself.”

“A letter to James More?” said he.

“The same,” said I.

“Well, and I can tell ye more than that,” said Alan. “For the last
night, when you were fast asleep, I heard the man colloguing with some
one in the French, and then the door of that inn to be opened and
shut.”

“Alan!” cried I, “you slept all night, and I am here to prove it.”

“Ay, but I would never trust Alan whether he was asleep or waking!”
says he. “But the business looks bad. Let’s see the letter.”

I gave it him.

“Catriona,” said he, “you have to excuse me, my dear; but there’s
nothing less than my fine bones upon the cast of it, and I’ll have to
break this seal.”

“It is my wish,” said Catriona.

He opened it, glanced it through, and flung his hand in the air.

“The stinking brock!” says he, and crammed the paper in his pocket.
“Here, let’s get our things together. This place is fair death to me.”
And he began to walk towards the inn.

It was Catriona that spoke the first. “He has sold you?” she asked.

“Sold me, my dear,” said Alan. “But thanks to you and Davie, I’ll can
jink him yet. Just let me win upon my horse,” he added.

“Catriona must come with us,” said I. “She can have no more traffic
with that man. She and I are to be married.” At which she pressed my
hand to her side.

“Are ye there with it?” says Alan, looking back. “The best day’s work
that ever either of you did yet! And I’m bound to say, my dawtie, ye
make a real, bonny couple.”

The way that he was following brought us close in by the windmill,
where I was aware of a man in seaman’s trousers, who seemed to be
spying from behind it. Only, of course, we took him in the rear.

“See, Alan!”

“Wheesht!” said, he, “this is my affairs.”

The man was, no doubt, a little deafened by the clattering of the mill,
and we got up close before he noticed. Then he turned, and we saw he
was a big fellow with a mahogany face.

“I think, sir,” says Alan, “that you speak the English?”

“_Non_, _monsieur_,” says he, with an incredible bad accent.

“_Non_, _monsieur_,” cries Alan, mocking him. “Is that how they learn
you French on the _Seahorse_? Ye muckle, gutsey hash, here’s a Scots
boot to your English hurdies!”

And bounding on him before he could escape, he dealt the man a kick
that laid him on his nose. Then he stood, with a savage smile, and
watched him scramble to his feet and scamper off into the sand-hills.

“But it’s high time I was clear of these empty bents!” said Alan; and
continued his way at top speed, and we still following, to the backdoor
of Bazin’s inn.

It chanced that as we entered by the one door we came face to face with
James More entering by the other.

“Here!” said I to Catriona, “quick! upstairs with you and make your
packets; this is no fit scene for you.”

In the meanwhile James and Alan had met in the midst of the long room.
She passed them close by to reach the stairs; and after she was some
way up I saw her turn and glance at them again, though without pausing.
Indeed, they were worth looking at. Alan wore as they met one of his
best appearances of courtesy and friendliness, yet with something
eminently warlike, so that James smelled danger off the man, as folk
smell fire in a house, and stood prepared for accidents.

Time pressed. Alan’s situation in that solitary place, and his enemies
about him, might have daunted Cæsar. It made no change in him; and it
was in his old spirit of mockery and daffing that he began the
interview.

“A braw good day to ye again, Mr. Drummond,” said he. “What’ll yon
business of yours be just about?”

“Why, the thing being private, and rather of a long story,” says James,
“I think it will keep very well till we have eaten.”

“I’m none so sure of that,” said Alan. “It sticks in my mind it’s
either now or never; for the fact is me and Mr. Balfour here have
gotten a line, and we’re thinking of the road.”

I saw a little surprise in James’s eye; but he held himself stoutly.

“I have but the one word to say to cure you of that,” said he, “and
that is the name of my business.”

“Say it then,” says Alan. “Hout! wha minds for Davie?”

“It is a matter that would make us both rich men,” said James.

“Do you tell me that?” cries Alan.

“I do, sir,” said James. “The plain fact is that it is Cluny’s
Treasure.”

“No!” cried Alan. “Have ye got word of it?”

“I ken the place, Mr. Stewart, and can take you there,” said James.

“This crowns all!” says Alan. “Well, and I’m glad I came to Dunkirk.
And so this was your business, was it? Halvers, I’m thinking?”

“That is the business, sir,” said James.

“Well, well,” said Alan; and then in the same tone of childlike
interest, “it has naething to do with the _Seahorse_, then?” he asked.

“With what?” says James.

“Or the lad that I have just kicked the bottom of behind yon windmill?”
pursued Alan. “Hut, man! have done with your lees! I have Palliser’s
letter here in my pouch. You’re by with it, James More. You can never
show your face again with dacent folk.”

James was taken all aback with it. He stood a second, motionless and
white, then swelled with the living anger.

“Do you talk to me, you bastard?” he roared out.

“Ye glee’d swine!” cried Alan, and hit him a sounding buffet on the
mouth, and the next wink of time their blades clashed together.

At the first sound of the bare steel I instinctively leaped back from
the collision. The next I saw, James parried a thrust so nearly that I
thought him killed; and it lowed up in my mind that this was the girl’s
father, and in a manner almost my own, and I drew and ran in to sever
them.

“Keep back, Davie! Are ye daft! Damn ye, keep back!” roared Alan. “Your
blood be on your ain heid then!”

I beat their blades down twice. I was knocked reeling against the wall;
I was back again betwixt them. They took no heed of me, thrusting at
each other like two furies. I can never think how I avoided being
stabbed myself or stabbing one of these two Rodomonts, and the whole
business turned about me like a piece of a dream; in the midst of which
I heard a great cry from the stair, and Catriona sprang before her
father. In the same moment the point of my sword encountered some thing
yielding. It came back to me reddened. I saw the blood flow on the
girl’s kerchief, and stood sick.

“Will you be killing him before my eyes, and me his daughter after
all!” she cried.

“My dear, I have done with him,” said Alan, and went, and sat on a
table, with his arms crossed and the sword naked in his hand.

Awhile she stood before the man, panting, with big eyes, then swung
suddenly about and faced him.

“Begone!” was her word, “take your shame out of my sight; leave me with
clean folk. I am a daughter of Alpin! Shame of the sons of Alpin,
begone!”

It was said with so much passion as awoke me from the horror of my own
bloodied sword. The two stood facing, she with the red stain on her
kerchief, he white as a rag. I knew him well enough—I knew it must have
pierced him in the quick place of his soul; but he betook himself to a
bravado air.

“Why,” says he, sheathing his sword, though still with a bright eye on
Alan, “if this brawl is over I will but get my portmanteau—”

“There goes no pockmantie out of this place except with me,” says Alan.

“Sir!” cries James.

“James More,” says Alan, “this lady daughter of yours is to marry my
friend Davie, upon the which account I let you pack with a hale
carcase. But take you my advice of it and get that carcase out of
harm’s way or ower late. Little as you suppose it, there are leemits to
my temper.”

“Be damned, sir, but my money’s there!” said James.

“I’m vexed about that, too,” says Alan, with his funny face, “but now,
ye see, it’s mines.” And then with more gravity, “Be you advised, James
More, you leave this house.”

James seemed to cast about for a moment in his mind; but it’s to be
thought he had enough of Alan’s swordsmanship, for he suddenly put off
his hat to us and (with a face like one of the damned) bade us farewell
in a series. With which he was gone.

At the same time a spell was lifted from me.

“Catriona,” I cried, “it was me—it was my sword. O, are you much hurt?”

“I know it, Davie, I am loving you for the pain of it; it was done
defending that bad man, my father. See!” she said, and showed me a
bleeding scratch, “see, you have made a man of me now. I will carry a
wound like an old soldier.”

Joy that she should be so little hurt, and the love of her brave
nature, supported me. I embraced her, I kissed the wound.

“And am I to be out of the kissing, me that never lost a chance?” says
Alan; and putting me aside and taking Catriona by either shoulder, “My
dear,” he said, “you’re a true daughter of Alpin. By all accounts, he
was a very fine man, and he may weel be proud of you. If ever I was to
get married, it’s the marrow of you I would be seeking for a mother to
my sons. And I bear’s a king’s name and speak the truth.”

He said it with a serious heat of admiration that was honey to the
girl, and through her, to me. It seemed to wipe us clean of all James
More’s disgraces. And the next moment he was just himself again.

“And now by your leave, my dawties,” said he, “this is a’ very bonny;
but Alan Breck’ll be a wee thing nearer to the gallows than he’s caring
for; and Dod! I think this is a grand place to be leaving.”

The word recalled us to some wisdom. Alan ran upstairs and returned
with our saddle-bags and James More’s portmanteau; I picked up
Catriona’s bundle where she had dropped it on the stair; and we were
setting forth out of that dangerous house, when Bazin stopped the way
with cries and gesticulations. He had whipped under a table when the
swords were drawn, but now he was as bold as a lion. There was his bill
to be settled, there was a chair broken, Alan had sat among his dinner
things, James More had fled.

“Here,” I cried, “pay yourself,” and flung him down some Lewie d’ors;
for I thought it was no time to be accounting.

He sprang upon that money, and we passed him by, and ran forth into the
open. Upon three sides of the house were seamen hasting and closing in;
a little nearer to us James More waved his hat as if to hurry them; and
right behind him, like some foolish person holding up his hands, were
the sails of the windmill turning.

Alan gave but one glance, and laid himself down to run. He carried a
great weight in James More’s portmanteau; but I think he would as soon
have lost his life as cast away that booty which was his revenge; and
he ran so that I was distressed to follow him, and marvelled and
exulted to see the girl bounding at my side.

As soon as we appeared, they cast off all disguise upon the other side;
and the seamen pursued us with shouts and view-hullohs. We had a start
of some two hundred yards, and they were but bandy-legged tarpaulins
after all, that could not hope to better us at such an exercise. I
suppose they were armed, but did not care to use their pistols on
French ground. And as soon as I perceived that we not only held our
advantage but drew a little away, I began to feel quite easy of the
issue. For all which, it was a hot, brisk bit of work, so long as it
lasted; Dunkirk was still far off; and when we popped over a knowe, and
found a company of the garrison marching on the other side on some
manœuvre, I could very well understand the word that Alan had.

He stopped running at once; and mopping at his brow, “They’re a real
bonny folk, the French nation,” says he.

CONCLUSION


No sooner were we safe within the walls of Dunkirk than we held a very
necessary council-of-war on our position. We had taken a daughter from
her father at the sword’s point; any judge would give her back to him
at once, and by all likelihood clap me and Alan into jail; and though
we had an argument upon our side in Captain Palliser’s letter, neither
Catriona nor I were very keen to be using it in public. Upon all
accounts it seemed the most prudent to carry the girl to Paris to the
hands of her own chieftain, Macgregor of Bohaldie, who would be very
willing to help his kinswoman, on the one hand, and not at all anxious
to dishonour James upon other.

We made but a slow journey of it up, for Catriona was not so good at
the riding as the running, and had scarce sat in the saddle since the
’Forty-five. But we made it out at last, reached Paris early of a
Sabbath morning, and made all speed, under Alan’s guidance, to find
Bohaldie. He was finely lodged, and lived in a good style, having a
pension on the Scots Fund, as well as private means; greeted Catriona
like one of his own house, and seemed altogether very civil and
discreet, but not particularly open. We asked of the news of James
More. “Poor James!” said he, and shook his head and smiled, so that I
thought he knew further than he meant to tell. Then we showed him
Palliser’s letter, and he drew a long face at that.

“Poor James!” said he again. “Well, there are worse folk than James
More, too. But this is dreadful bad. Tut, tut, he must have forgot
himself entirely! This is a most undesirable letter. But, for all that,
gentlemen, I cannot see what we would want to make it public for. It’s
an ill bird that fouls his own nest, and we are all Scots folk and all
Hieland.”

Upon this we all agreed, save perhaps Alan; and still more upon the
question of our marriage, which Bohaldie took in his own hands, as
though there had been no such person as James More, and gave Catriona
away with very pretty manners and agreeable compliments in French. It
was not till all was over, and our healths drunk, that he told us James
was in that city, whither he had preceded us some days, and where he
now lay sick, and like to die. I thought I saw by my wife’s face what
way her inclination pointed.

“And let us go see him, then,” said I.

“If it is your pleasure,” said Catriona. These were early days.

He was lodged in the same quarter of the city with his chief, in a
great house upon a corner; and we were guided up to the garret where he
lay by the sound of Highland piping. It seemed he had just borrowed a
set of them from Bohaldie to amuse his sickness; though he was no such
hand as was his brother Rob, he made good music of the kind; and it was
strange to observe the French folk crowding on the stairs, and some of
them laughing. He lay propped in a pallet. The first look of him I saw
he was upon his last business; and, doubtless, this was a strange place
for him to die in. But even now I find I can scarce dwell upon his end
with patience. Doubtless, Bohaldie had prepared him; he seemed to know
we were married, complimented us on the event, and gave us a
benediction like a patriarch.

“I have been never understood,” said he. “I forgive you both without an
afterthought;” after which he spoke for all the world in his old
manner, was so obliging as to play us a tune or two upon his pipes, and
borrowed a small sum before I left.

I could not trace even a hint of shame in any part of his behaviour;
but he was great upon forgiveness; it seemed always fresh to him. I
think he forgave me every time we met; and when after some four days he
passed away in a kind of odour of affectionate sanctity, I could have
torn my hair out for exasperation. I had him buried; but what to put
upon his tomb was quite beyond me, till at last I considered the date
would look best alone.

I thought it wiser to resign all thoughts of Leyden, where we had
appeared once as brother and sister, and it would certainly look
strange to return in a new character. Scotland would be doing for us;
and thither, after I had recovered that which I had left behind, we
sailed in a Low Country ship.


And now, Miss Barbara Balfour (to set the ladies first), and Mr. Alan
Balfour younger of Shaws, here is the story brought fairly to an end. A
great many of the folk that took a part in it, you will find (if you
think well) that you have seen and spoken with. Alison Hastie in
Limekilns was the lass that rocked your cradle when you were too small
to know of it, and walked abroad with you in the policy when you were
bigger. That very fine great lady that is Miss Barbara’s name-mamma is
no other than the same Miss Grant that made so much a fool of David
Balfour in the house of the Lord Advocate. And I wonder whether you
remember a little, lean, lively gentleman in a scratch-wig and a
wraprascal, that came to Shaws very late of a dark night, and whom you
were awakened out of your beds and brought down to the dining-hall to
be presented to, by the name of Mr. Jamieson? Or has Alan forgotten
what he did at Mr. Jamieson’s request—a most disloyal act—for which, by
the letter of the law, he might be hanged—no less than drinking the
king’s health _across the water_? These were strange doings in a good
Whig house! But Mr. Jamieson is a man privileged, and might set fire to
my corn-barn; and the name they know him by now in France is the
Chevalier Stewart.

As for Davie and Catriona, I shall watch you pretty close in the next
days, and see if you are so bold as to be laughing at papa and mamma.
It is true we were not so wise as we might have been, and made a great
deal of sorrow out of nothing; but you will find as you grow up that
even the artful Miss Barbara, and even the valiant Mr. Alan, will be
not so very much wiser than their parents. For the life of man upon
this world of ours is a funny business. They talk of the angels
weeping; but I think they must more often be holding their sides as
they look on; and there was one thing I determined to do when I began
this long story, and that was to tell out everything as it befell.

STORY OF THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE CREAM TARTS


During his residence in London, the accomplished Prince Florizel of
Bohemia gained the affection of all classes by the seduction of his
manner and by a well-considered generosity. He was a remarkable man
even by what was known of him; and that was but a small part of what he
actually did. Although of a placid temper in ordinary circumstances,
and accustomed to take the world with as much philosophy as any
ploughman, the Prince of Bohemia was not without a taste for ways of
life more adventurous and eccentric than that to which he was destined
by his birth. Now and then, when he fell into a low humour, when there
was no laughable play to witness in any of the London theatres, and
when the season of the year was unsuitable to those field sports in
which he excelled all competitors, he would summon his confidant and
Master of the Horse, Colonel Geraldine, and bid him prepare himself
against an evening ramble. The Master of the Horse was a young officer
of a brave and even temerarious disposition. He greeted the news with
delight, and hastened to make ready. Long practice and a varied
acquaintance of life had given him a singular facility in disguise; he
could adapt not only his face and bearing, but his voice and almost his
thoughts, to those of any rank, character, or nation; and in this way
he diverted attention from the Prince, and sometimes gained admission
for the pair into strange societies. The civil authorities were never
taken into the secret of these adventures; the imperturbable courage of
the one and the ready invention and chivalrous devotion of the other
had brought them through a score of dangerous passes; and they grew in
confidence as time went on.

One evening in March they were driven by a sharp fall of sleet into an
Oyster Bar in the immediate neighbourhood of Leicester Square. Colonel
Geraldine was dressed and painted to represent a person connected with
the Press in reduced circumstances; while the Prince had, as usual,
travestied his appearance by the addition of false whiskers and a pair
of large adhesive eyebrows. These lent him a shaggy and weather-beaten
air, which, for one of his urbanity, formed the most impenetrable
disguise. Thus equipped, the commander and his satellite sipped their
brandy and soda in security.

The bar was full of guests, male and female; but though more than one
of these offered to fall into talk with our adventurers, none of them
promised to grow interesting upon a nearer acquaintance. There was
nothing present but the lees of London and the commonplace of
disrespectability; and the Prince had already fallen to yawning, and
was beginning to grow weary of the whole excursion, when the swing
doors were pushed violently open, and a young man, followed by a couple
of commissionaires, entered the bar. Each of the commissionaires
carried a large dish of cream tarts under a cover, which they at once
removed; and the young man made the round of the company, and pressed
these confections upon every one’s acceptance with an exaggerated
courtesy. Sometimes his offer was laughingly accepted; sometimes it was
firmly, or even harshly, rejected. In these latter cases the new-comer
always ate the tart himself, with some more or less humorous
commentary.

At last he accosted Prince Florizel.

“Sir,” said he, with a profound obeisance, proffering the tart at the
same time between his thumb and forefinger, “will you so far honour an
entire stranger? I can answer for the quality of the pastry, having
eaten two dozen and three of them myself since five o’clock.”

“I am in the habit,” replied the Prince, “of looking not so much to the
nature of a gift as to the spirit in which it is offered.”

“The spirit, sir,” returned the young man, with another bow, “is one of
mockery.”

“Mockery?” repeated Florizel. “And whom do you propose to mock?”

“I am not here to expound my philosophy,” replied the other, “but to
distribute these cream tarts. If I mention that I heartily include
myself in the ridicule of the transaction, I hope you will consider
honour satisfied and condescend. If not, you will constrain me to eat
my twenty-eighth, and I own to being weary of the exercise.”

“You touch me,” said the Prince, “and I have all the will in the world
to rescue you from this dilemma, but upon one condition. If my friend
and I eat your cakes—for which we have neither of us any natural
inclination—we shall expect you to join us at supper by way of
recompense.”

The young man seemed to reflect.

“I have still several dozen upon hand,” he said at last; “and that will
make it necessary for me to visit several more bars before my great
affair is concluded. This will take some time; and if you are hungry—”

The Prince interrupted him with a polite gesture.

“My friend and I will accompany you,” he said; “for we have already a
deep interest in your very agreeable mode of passing an evening. And
now that the preliminaries of peace are settled, allow me to sign the
treaty for both.”

And the Prince swallowed the tart with the best grace imaginable.

“It is delicious,” said he.

“I perceive you are a connoisseur,” replied the young man.

Colonel Geraldine likewise did honour to the pastry; and every one in
that bar having now either accepted or refused his delicacies, the
young man with the cream tarts led the way to another and similar
establishment. The two commissionaires, who seemed to have grown
accustomed to their absurd employment, followed immediately after; and
the Prince and the Colonel brought up the rear, arm in arm, and smiling
to each other as they went. In this order the company visited two other
taverns, where scenes were enacted of a like nature to that already
described—some refusing, some accepting, the favours of this vagabond
hospitality, and the young man himself eating each rejected tart.

On leaving the third saloon the young man counted his store. There were
but nine remaining, three in one tray and six in the other.

“Gentlemen,” said he, addressing himself to his two new followers, “I
am unwilling to delay your supper. I am positively sure you must be
hungry. I feel that I owe you a special consideration. And on this
great day for me, when I am closing a career of folly by my most
conspicuously silly action, I wish to behave handsomely to all who give
me countenance. Gentlemen, you shall wait no longer. Although my
constitution is shattered by previous excesses, at the risk of my life
I liquidate the suspensory condition.”

With these words he crushed the nine remaining tarts into his mouth,
and swallowed them at a single movement each. Then, turning to the
commissionaires, he gave them a couple of sovereigns.

“I have to thank you,” said be, “for your extraordinary patience.”

And he dismissed them with a bow apiece. For some seconds he stood
looking at the purse from which he had just paid his assistants, then,
with a laugh, he tossed it into the middle of the street, and signified
his readiness for supper.

In a small French restaurant in Soho, which had enjoyed an exaggerated
reputation for some little while, but had already begun to be
forgotten, and in a private room up two pair of stairs, the three
companions made a very elegant supper, and drank three or four bottles
of champagne, talking the while upon indifferent subjects. The young
man was fluent and gay, but he laughed louder than was natural in a
person of polite breeding; his hands trembled violently, and his voice
took sudden and surprising inflections, which seemed to be independent
of his will. The dessert had been cleared away, and all three had
lighted their cigars, when the Prince addressed him in these words:—

“You will, I am sure, pardon my curiosity. What I have seen of you has
greatly pleased but even more puzzled me. And though I should be loth
to seem indiscreet, I must tell you that my friend and I are persons
very well worthy to be entrusted with a secret. We have many of our
own, which we are continually revealing to improper ears. And if, as I
suppose, your story is a silly one, you need have no delicacy with us,
who are two of the silliest men in England. My name is Godall,
Theophilus Godall; my friend is Major Alfred Hammersmith—or at least,
such is the name by which he chooses to be known. We pass our lives
entirely in the search for extravagant adventures; and there is no
extravagance with which we are not capable of sympathy.”

“I like you, Mr. Godall,” returned the young man; “you inspire me with
a natural confidence; and I have not the slightest objection to your
friend the Major, whom I take to be a nobleman in masquerade. At least,
I am sure he is no soldier.”

The Colonel smiled at this compliment to the perfection of his art; and
the young man went on in a more animated manner.

“There is every reason why I should not tell you my story. Perhaps that
is just the reason why I am going to do so. At least, you seem so well
prepared to hear a tale of silliness that I cannot find it in my heart
to disappoint you. My name, in spite of your example, I shall keep to
myself. My age is not essential to the narrative. I am descended from
my ancestors by ordinary generation, and from them I inherited the very
eligible human tenement which I still occupy and a fortune of three
hundred pounds a year. I suppose they also handed on to me a hare-brain
humour, which it has been my chief delight to indulge. I received a
good education. I can play the violin nearly well enough to earn money
in the orchestra of a penny gaff, but not quite. The same remark
applies to the flute and the French horn. I learned enough of whist to
lose about a hundred a year at that scientific game. My acquaintance
with French was sufficient to enable me to squander money in Paris with
almost the same facility as in London. In short, I am a person full of
manly accomplishments. I have had every sort of adventure, including a
duel about nothing. Only two months ago I met a young lady exactly
suited to my taste in mind and body; I found my heart melt; I saw that
I had come upon my fate at last, and was in the way to fall in love.
But when I came to reckon up what remained to me of my capital, I found
it amounted to something less than four hundred pounds! I ask you
fairly—can a man who respects himself fall in love on four hundred
pounds? I concluded, certainly not; left the presence of my charmer,
and slightly accelerating my usual rate of expenditure, came this
morning to my last eighty pounds. This I divided into two equal parts;
forty I reserved for a particular purpose; the remaining forty I was to
dissipate before the night. I have passed a very entertaining day, and
played many farces besides that of the cream tarts which procured me
the advantage of your acquaintance; for I was determined, as I told
you, to bring a foolish career to a still more foolish conclusion; and
when you saw me throw my purse into the street, the forty pounds were
at an end. Now you know me as well as I know myself: a fool, but
consistent in his folly; and, as I will ask you to believe, neither a
whimperer nor a coward.”

From the whole tone of the young man’s statement it was plain that he
harboured very bitter and contemptuous thoughts about himself. His
auditors were led to imagine that his love affair was nearer his heart
than he admitted, and that he had a design on his own life. The farce
of the cream tarts began to have very much the air of a tragedy in
disguise.

“Why, is this not odd,” broke out Geraldine, giving a look to Prince
Florizel, “that we three fellows should have met by the merest accident
in so large a wilderness as London, and should be so nearly in the same
condition?”

“How?” cried the young man. “Are you, too, ruined? Is this supper a
folly like my cream tarts? Has the devil brought three of his own
together for a last carouse?”

“The devil, depend upon it, can sometimes do a very gentlemanly thing,”
returned Prince Florizel; “and I am so much touched by this
coincidence, that, although we are not entirely in the same case, I am
going to put an end to the disparity. Let your heroic treatment of the
last cream tarts be my example.”

So saying, the Prince drew out his purse and took from it a small
bundle of bank-notes.

“You see, I was a week or so behind you, but I mean to catch you up and
come neck and neck into the winning-post,” he continued. “This,” laying
one of the notes upon the table, “will suffice for the bill. As for the
rest—”

He tossed them into the fire, and they went up the chimney in a single
blaze.

The young man tried to catch his arm, but as the table was between them
his interference came too late.

“Unhappy man,” he cried, “you should not have burned them all! You
should have kept forty pounds.”

“Forty pounds!” repeated the Prince. “Why, in heaven’s name, forty
pounds?”

“Why not eighty?” cried the Colonel; “for to my certain knowledge there
must have been a hundred in the bundle.”

“It was only forty pounds he needed,” said the young man gloomily. “But
without them there is no admission. The rule is strict. Forty pounds
for each. Accursed life, where a man cannot even die without money!”

The Prince and the Colonel exchanged glances. “Explain yourself,” said
the latter. “I have still a pocket-book tolerably well lined, and I
need not say how readily I should share my wealth with Godall. But I
must know to what end: you must certainly tell us what you mean.”

The young man seemed to awaken; he looked uneasily from one to the
other, and his face flushed deeply.

“You are not fooling me?” he asked. “You are indeed ruined men like
me?”

“Indeed, I am for my part,” replied the Colonel.

“And for mine,” said the Prince, “I have given you proof. Who but a
ruined man would throw his notes into the fire? The action speaks for
itself.”

“A ruined man—yes,” returned the other suspiciously, “or else a
millionaire.”

“Enough, sir,” said the Prince; “I have said so, and I am not
accustomed to have my word remain in doubt.”

“Ruined?” said the young man. “Are you ruined, like me? Are you, after
a life of indulgence, come to such a pass that you can only indulge
yourself in one thing more? Are you”—he kept lowering his voice as he
went on—“are you going to give yourselves that last indulgence? Are you
going to avoid the consequences of your folly by the one infallible and
easy path? Are you going to give the slip to the sheriff’s officers of
conscience by the one open door?”

Suddenly he broke off and attempted to laugh.

“Here is your health!” he cried, emptying his glass, “and good night to
you, my merry ruined men.”

Colonel Geraldine caught him by the arm as he was about to rise.

“You lack confidence in us,” he said, “and you are wrong. To all your
questions I make answer in the affirmative. But I am not so timid, and
can speak the Queen’s English plainly. We too, like yourself, have had
enough of life, and are determined to die. Sooner or later, alone or
together, we meant to seek out death and beard him where he lies ready.
Since we have met you, and your case is more pressing, let it be
to-night—and at once—and, if you will, all three together. Such a
penniless trio,” he cried, “should go arm in arm into the halls of
Pluto, and give each other some countenance among the shades!”

Geraldine had hit exactly on the manners and intonations that became
the part he was playing. The Prince himself was disturbed, and looked
over at his confidant with a shade of doubt. As for the young man, the
flush came back darkly into his cheek, and his eyes threw out a spark
of light.

“You are the men for me!” he cried, with an almost terrible gaiety.
“Shake hands upon the bargain!” (his hand was cold and wet). “You
little know in what a company you will begin the march! You little know
in what a happy moment for yourselves you partook of my cream tarts! I
am only a unit, but I am a unit in an army. I know Death’s private
door. I am one of his familiars, and can show you into eternity without
ceremony and yet without scandal.”

They called upon him eagerly to explain his meaning.

“Can you muster eighty pounds between you?” he demanded.

Geraldine ostentatiously consulted his pocket-book, and replied in the
affirmative.

“Fortunate beings!” cried the young man. “Forty pounds is the entry
money of the Suicide Club.”

“The Suicide Club,” said the Prince, “why, what the devil is that?”

“Listen,” said the young man; “this is the age of conveniences, and I
have to tell you of the last perfection of the sort. We have affairs in
different places; and hence railways were invented. Railways separated
us infallibly from our friends; and so telegraphs were made that we
might communicate speedier at great distances. Even in hotels we have
lifts to spare us a climb of some hundred steps. Now, we know that life
is only a stage to play the fool upon as long as the part amuses us.
There was one more convenience lacking to modern comfort; a decent,
easy way to quit that stage; the back stairs to liberty; or, as I said
this moment, Death’s private door. This, my two fellow-rebels, is
supplied by the Suicide Club. Do not suppose that you and I are alone,
or even exceptional in the highly reasonable desire that we profess. A
large number of our fellowmen, who have grown heartily sick of the
performance in which they are expected to join daily and all their
lives long, are only kept from flight by one or two considerations.
Some have families who would be shocked, or even blamed, if the matter
became public; others have a weakness at heart and recoil from the
circumstances of death. That is, to some extent, my own experience. I
cannot put a pistol to my head and draw the trigger; for something
stronger than myself withholds the act; and although I loathe life, I
have not strength enough in my body to take hold of death and be done
with it. For such as I, and for all who desire to be out of the coil
without posthumous scandal, the Suicide Club has been inaugurated. How
this has been managed, what is its history, or what may be its
ramifications in other lands, I am myself uninformed; and what I know
of its constitution, I am not at liberty to communicate to you. To this
extent, however, I am at your service. If you are truly tired of life,
I will introduce you to-night to a meeting; and if not to-night, at
least some time within the week, you will be easily relieved of your
existences. It is now (consulting his watch) eleven; by half-past, at
latest, we must leave this place; so that you have half-an-hour before
you to consider my proposal. It is more serious than a cream tart,” he
added, with a smile; “and I suspect more palatable.”

“More serious, certainly,” returned Colonel Geraldine; “and as it is so
much more so, will you allow me five minutes’ speech in private with my
friend, Mr. Godall?”

“It is only fair,” answered the young man. “If you will permit, I will
retire.”

“You will be very obliging,” said the Colonel.

As soon as the two were alone—“What,” said Prince Florizel, “is the use
of this confabulation, Geraldine? I see you are flurried, whereas my
mind is very tranquilly made up. I will see the end of this.”

“Your Highness,” said the Colonel, turning pale; “let me ask you to
consider the importance of your life, not only to your friends, but to
the public interest. ‘If not to-night,’ said this madman; but supposing
that to-night some irreparable disaster were to overtake your
Highness’s person, what, let me ask you, what would be my despair, and
what the concern and disaster of a great nation?”

“I will see the end of this,” repeated the Prince in his most
deliberate tones; “and have the kindness, Colonel Geraldine, to
remember and respect your word of honour as a gentleman. Under no
circumstances, recollect, nor without my special authority, are you to
betray the incognito under which I choose to go abroad. These were my
commands, which I now reiterate. And now,” he added, “let me ask you to
call for the bill.”

Colonel Geraldine bowed in submission; but he had a very white face as
he summoned the young man of the cream tarts, and issued his directions
to the waiter. The Prince preserved his undisturbed demeanour, and
described a Palais Royal farce to the young suicide with great humour
and gusto. He avoided the Colonel’s appealing looks without
ostentation, and selected another cheroot with more than usual care.
Indeed, he was now the only man of the party who kept any command over
his nerves.

The bill was discharged, the Prince giving the whole change of the note
to the astonished waiter; and the three drove off in a four-wheeler.
They were not long upon the way before the cab stopped at the entrance
to a rather dark court. Here all descended.

After Geraldine had paid the fare, the young man turned, and addressed
Prince Florizel as follows:—

“It is still time, Mr. Godall, to make good your escape into thraldom.
And for you too, Major Hammersmith. Reflect well before you take
another step; and if your hearts say no—here are the cross-roads.”

“Lead on, sir,” said the Prince. “I am not the man to go back from a
thing once said.”

“Your coolness does me good,” replied their guide. “I have never seen
any one so unmoved at this conjuncture; and yet you are not the first
whom I have escorted to this door. More than one of my friends has
preceded me, where I knew I must shortly follow. But this is of no
interest to you. Wait me here for only a few moments; I shall return as
soon as I have arranged the preliminaries of your introduction.”

And with that the young man, waving his hand to his companions, turned
into the court, entered a doorway and disappeared.

“Of all our follies,” said Colonel Geraldine in a low voice, “this is
the wildest and most dangerous.”

“I perfectly believe so,” returned the Prince.

“We have still,” pursued the Colonel, “a moment to ourselves. Let me
beseech your Highness to profit by the opportunity and retire. The
consequences of this step are so dark, and may be so grave, that I feel
myself justified in pushing a little farther than usual the liberty
which your Highness is so condescending as to allow me in private.”

“Am I to understand that Colonel Geraldine is afraid?” asked his
Highness, taking his cheroot from his lips, and looking keenly into the
other’s face.

“My fear is certainly not personal,” replied the other proudly; “of
that your Highness may rest well assured.”

“I had supposed as much,” returned the Prince, with undisturbed good
humour; “but I was unwilling to remind you of the difference in our
stations. No more—no more,” he added, seeing Geraldine about to
apologise, “you stand excused.”

And he smoked placidly, leaning against a railing, until the young man
returned.

“Well,” he asked, “has our reception been arranged?”

“Follow me,” was the reply. “The President will see you in the cabinet.
And let me warn you to be frank in your answers. I have stood your
guarantee; but the club requires a searching inquiry before admission;
for the indiscretion of a single member would lead to the dispersion of
the whole society for ever.”

The Prince and Geraldine put their heads together for a moment. “Bear
me out in this,” said the one; and “bear me out in that,” said the
other; and by boldly taking up the characters of men with whom both
were acquainted, they had come to an agreement in a twinkling, and were
ready to follow their guide into the President’s cabinet.

There were no formidable obstacles to pass. The outer door stood open;
the door of the cabinet was ajar; and there, in a small but very high
apartment, the young man left them once more.

“He will be here immediately,” he said, with a nod, as he disappeared.

Voices were audible in the cabinet through the folding doors which
formed one end; and now and then the noise of a champagne cork,
followed by a burst of laughter, intervened among the sounds of
conversation. A single tall window looked out upon the river and the
embankment; and by the disposition of the lights they judged themselves
not far from Charing Cross station. The furniture was scanty, and the
coverings worn to the thread; and there was nothing movable except a
hand-bell in the centre of a round table, and the hats and coats of a
considerable party hung round the wall on pegs.

“What sort of a den is this?” said Geraldine.

“That is what I have come to see,” replied the Prince. “If they keep
live devils on the premises, the thing may grow amusing.”

Just then the folding door was opened no more than was necessary for
the passage of a human body; and there entered at the same moment a
louder buzz of talk, and the redoubtable President of the Suicide Club.
The President was a man of fifty or upwards; large and rambling in his
gait, with shaggy side whiskers, a bald top to his head, and a veiled
grey eye, which now and then emitted a twinkle. His mouth, which
embraced a large cigar, he kept continually screwing round and round
and from side to side, as he looked sagaciously and coldly at the
strangers. He was dressed in light tweeds, with his neck very open in a
striped shirt collar; and carried a minute book under one arm.

“Good evening,” said he, after he had closed the door behind him. “I am
told you wish to speak with me.”

“We have a desire, sir, to join the Suicide Club,” replied the Colonel.

The President rolled his cigar about in his mouth. “What is that?” he
said abruptly.

“Pardon me,” returned the Colonel, “but I believe you are the person
best qualified to give us information on that point.”

“I?” cried the President. “A Suicide Club? Come, come! this is a frolic
for All Fools’ Day. I can make allowances for gentlemen who get merry
in their liquor; but let there be an end to this.”

“Call your Club what you will,” said the Colonel, “you have some
company behind these doors, and we insist on joining it.”

“Sir,” returned the President curtly, “you have made a mistake. This is
a private house, and you must leave it instantly.”

The Prince had remained quietly in his seat throughout this little
colloquy; but now, when the Colonel looked over to him, as much as to
say, “Take your answer and come away, for God’s sake!” he drew his
cheroot from his mouth, and spoke—

“I have come here,” said he, “upon the invitation of a friend of yours.
He has doubtless informed you of my intention in thus intruding on your
party. Let me remind you that a person in my circumstances has
exceedingly little to bind him, and is not at all likely to tolerate
much rudeness. I am a very quiet man, as a usual thing; but, my dear
sir, you are either going to oblige me in the little matter of which
you are aware, or you shall very bitterly repent that you ever admitted
me to your ante-chamber.”

The President laughed aloud.

“That is the way to speak,” said he. “You are a man who is a man. You
know the way to my heart, and can do what you like with me. Will you,”
he continued, addressing Geraldine, “will you step aside for a few
minutes? I shall finish first with your companion, and some of the
club’s formalities require to be fulfilled in private.”

With these words he opened the door of a small closet, into which he
shut the Colonel.

“I believe in you,” he said to Florizel, as soon as they were alone;
“but are you sure of your friend?”

“Not so sure as I am of myself, though he has more cogent reasons,”
answered Florizel, “but sure enough to bring him here without alarm. He
has had enough to cure the most tenacious man of life. He was cashiered
the other day for cheating at cards.”

“A good reason, I daresay,” replied the President; “at least, we have
another in the same case, and I feel sure of him. Have you also been in
the Service, may I ask?”

“I have,” was the reply; “but I was too lazy, I left it early.”

“What is your reason for being tired of life?” pursued the President.

“The same, as near as I can make out,” answered the Prince;
“unadulterated laziness.”

The President started. “D—n it,” said he, “you must have something
better than that.”

“I have no more money,” added Florizel. “That is also a vexation,
without doubt. It brings my sense of idleness to an acute point.”

The President rolled his cigar round in his mouth for some seconds,
directing his gaze straight into the eyes of this unusual neophyte; but
the Prince supported his scrutiny with unabashed good temper.

“If I had not a deal of experience,” said the President at last, “I
should turn you off. But I know the world; and this much any way, that
the most frivolous excuses for a suicide are often the toughest to
stand by. And when I downright like a man, as I do you, sir, I would
rather strain the regulation than deny him.”

The Prince and the Colonel, one after the other, were subjected to a
long and particular interrogatory: the Prince alone; but Geraldine in
the presence of the Prince, so that the President might observe the
countenance of the one while the other was being warmly cross-examined.
The result was satisfactory; and the President, after having booked a
few details of each case, produced a form of oath to be accepted.
Nothing could be conceived more passive than the obedience promised, or
more stringent than the terms by which the juror bound himself. The man
who forfeited a pledge so awful could scarcely have a rag of honour or
any of the consolations of religion left to him. Florizel signed the
document, but not without a shudder; the Colonel followed his example
with an air of great depression. Then the President received the entry
money; and without more ado, introduced the two friends into the
smoking-room of the Suicide Club.

The smoking-room of the Suicide Club was the same height as the cabinet
into which it opened, but much larger, and papered from top to bottom
with an imitation of oak wainscot. A large and cheerful fire and a
number of gas-jets illuminated the company. The Prince and his follower
made the number up to eighteen. Most of the party were smoking, and
drinking champagne; a feverish hilarity reigned, with sudden and rather
ghastly pauses.

“Is this a full meeting?” asked the Prince.

“Middling,” said the President. “By the way,” he added, “if you have
any money, it is usual to offer some champagne. It keeps up a good
spirit, and is one of my own little perquisites.”

“Hammersmith,” said Florizel, “I may leave the champagne to you.”

And with that he turned away and began to go round among the guests.
Accustomed to play the host in the highest circles, he charmed and
dominated all whom he approached; there was something at once winning
and authoritative in his address; and his extraordinary coolness gave
him yet another distinction in this half maniacal society. As he went
from one to another he kept both his eyes and ears open, and soon began
to gain a general idea of the people among whom he found himself. As in
all other places of resort, one type predominated: people in the prime
of youth, with every show of intelligence and sensibility in their
appearance, but with little promise of strength or the quality that
makes success. Few were much above thirty, and not a few were still in
their teens. They stood, leaning on tables and shifting on their feet;
sometimes they smoked extraordinarily fast, and sometimes they let
their cigars go out; some talked well, but the conversation of others
was plainly the result of nervous tension, and was equally without wit
or purport. As each new bottle of champagne was opened, there was a
manifest improvement in gaiety. Only two were seated—one in a chair in
the recess of the window, with his head hanging and his hands plunged
deep into his trouser pockets, pale, visibly moist with perspiration,
saying never a word, a very wreck of soul and body; the other sat on
the divan close by the chimney, and attracted notice by a trenchant
dissimilarity from all the rest. He was probably upwards of forty, but
he looked fully ten years older; and Florizel thought he had never seen
a man more naturally hideous, nor one more ravaged by disease and
ruinous excitements. He was no more than skin and bone, was partly
paralysed, and wore spectacles of such unusual power, that his eyes
appeared through the glasses greatly magnified and distorted in shape.
Except the Prince and the President, he was the only person in the room
who preserved the composure of ordinary life.

There was little decency among the members of the club. Some boasted of
the disgraceful actions, the consequences of which had reduced them to
seek refuge in death; and the others listened without disapproval.
There was a tacit understanding against moral judgments; and whoever
passed the club doors enjoyed already some of the immunities of the
tomb. They drank to each other’s memories, and to those of notable
suicides in the past. They compared and developed their different views
of death—some declaring that it was no more than blackness and
cessation; others full of a hope that that very night they should be
scaling the stars and commencing with the mighty dead.

“To the eternal memory of Baron Trenck, the type of suicides!” cried
one. “He went out of a small cell into a smaller, that he might come
forth again to freedom.”

“For my part,” said a second, “I wish no more than a bandage for my
eyes and cotton for my ears. Only they have no cotton thick enough in
this world.”

A third was for reading the mysteries of life in a future state; and a
fourth professed that he would never have joined the club, if he had
not been induced to believe in Mr. Darwin.

“I could not bear,” said this remarkable suicide, “to be descended from
an ape.”

Altogether, the Prince was disappointed by the bearing and conversation
of the members.

“It does not seem to me,” he thought, “a matter for so much
disturbance. If a man has made up his mind to kill himself, let him do
it, in God’s name, like a gentleman. This flutter and big talk is out
of place.”

In the meanwhile Colonel Geraldine was a prey to the blackest
apprehensions; the club and its rules were still a mystery, and he
looked round the room for some one who should be able to set his mind
at rest. In this survey his eye lighted on the paralytic person with
the strong spectacles; and seeing him so exceedingly tranquil, he
besought the President, who was going in and out of the room under a
pressure of business, to present him to the gentleman on the divan.

The functionary explained the needlessness of all such formalities
within the club, but nevertheless presented Mr. Hammersmith to Mr.
Malthus.

Mr. Malthus looked at the Colonel curiously, and then requested him to
take a seat upon his right.

“You are a new-comer,” he said, “and wish information? You have come to
the proper source. It is two years since I first visited this charming
club.”

The Colonel breathed again. If Mr. Malthus had frequented the place for
two years there could be little danger for the Prince in a single
evening. But Geraldine was none the less astonished, and began to
suspect a mystification.

“What!” cried he, “two years! I thought—but indeed I see I have been
made the subject of a pleasantry.”

“By no means,” replied Mr. Malthus mildly. “My case is peculiar. I am
not, properly speaking, a suicide at all; but, as it were, an honorary
member. I rarely visit the club twice in two months. My infirmity and
the kindness of the President have procured me these little immunities,
for which besides I pay at an advanced rate. Even as it is my luck has
been extraordinary.”

“I am afraid,” said the Colonel, “that I must ask you to be more
explicit. You must remember that I am still most imperfectly acquainted
with the rules of the club.”

“An ordinary member who comes here in search of death like yourself,”
replied the paralytic, “returns every evening until fortune favours
him. He can even, if he is penniless, get board and lodging from the
President: very fair, I believe, and clean, although, of course, not
luxurious; that could hardly be, considering the exiguity (if I may so
express myself) of the subscription. And then the President’s company
is a delicacy in itself.”

“Indeed!” cried Geraldine, “he had not greatly prepossessed me.”

“Ah!” said Mr. Malthus, “you do not know the man: the drollest fellow!
What stories! What cynicism! He knows life to admiration and, between
ourselves, is probably the most corrupt rogue in Christendom.”

“And he also,” asked the Colonel, “is a permanency—like yourself, if I
may say so without offence?”

“Indeed, he is a permanency in a very different sense from me,” replied
Mr. Malthus. “I have been graciously spared, but I must go at last. Now
he never plays. He shuffles and deals for the club, and makes the
necessary arrangements. That man, my dear Mr. Hammersmith, is the very
soul of ingenuity. For three years he has pursued in London his useful
and, I think I may add, his artistic calling; and not so much as a
whisper of suspicion has been once aroused. I believe him myself to be
inspired. You doubtless remember the celebrated case, six months ago,
of the gentleman who was accidentally poisoned in a chemists shop? That
was one of the least rich, one of the least racy, of his notions; but
then, how simple! and how safe!”

“You astound me,” said the Colonel. “Was that unfortunate gentleman one
of the—” He was about to say “victims”; but bethinking himself in time,
he substituted—“members of the club?”

In the same flash of thought, it occurred to him that Mr. Malthus
himself had not at all spoken in the tone of one who is in love with
death; and he added hurriedly:

“But I perceive I am still in the dark. You speak of shuffling and
dealing; pray for what end? And since you seem rather unwilling to die
than otherwise, I must own that I cannot conceive what brings you here
at all.”

“You say truly that you are in the dark,” replied Mr. Malthus with more
animation. “Why, my dear sir, this club is the temple of intoxication.
If my enfeebled health could support the excitement more often, you may
depend upon it I should be more often here. It requires all the sense
of duty engendered by a long habit of ill-health and careful regimen,
to keep me from excess in this, which is, I may say, my last
dissipation. I have tried them all, sir,” he went on, laying his hand
on Geraldine’s arm, “all without exception, and I declare to you, upon
my honour, there is not one of them that has not been grossly and
untruthfully overrated. People trifle with love. Now, I deny that love
is a strong passion. Fear is the strong passion; it is with fear that
you must trifle, if you wish to taste the intensest joys of living.
Envy me—envy me, sir,” he added with a chuckle, “I am a coward!”

Geraldine could scarcely repress a movement of repulsion for this
deplorable wretch; but he commanded himself with an effort, and
continued his inquiries.

“How, sir,” he asked, “is the excitement so artfully prolonged? and
where is there any element of uncertainty?”

“I must tell you how the victim for every evening is selected,”
returned Mr. Malthus; “and not only the victim, but another member, who
is to be the instrument in the club’s hands, and death’s high priest
for that occasion.”

“Good God!” said the Colonel, “do they then kill each other?”

“The trouble of suicide is removed in that way,” returned Malthus with
a nod.

“Merciful heavens!” ejaculated the Colonel, “and may you—may I—may
the—my friend I mean—may any of us be pitched upon this evening as the
slayer of another man’s body and immortal spirit? Can such things be
possible among men born of women? Oh! infamy of infamies!”

He was about to rise in his horror, when he caught the Prince’s eye. It
was fixed upon him from across the room with a frowning and angry
stare. And in a moment Geraldine recovered his composure.

“After all,” he added, “why not? And since you say the game is
interesting, _vogue la galère_—I follow the club!”

Mr. Malthus had keenly enjoyed the Colonel’s amazement and disgust. He
had the vanity of wickedness; and it pleased him to see another man
give way to a generous movement, while he felt himself, in his entire
corruption, superior to such emotions.

“You now, after your first moment of surprise,” said he, “are in a
position to appreciate the delights of our society. You can see how it
combines the excitement of a gaming-table, a duel, and a Roman
amphitheatre. The Pagans did well enough; I cordially admire the
refinement of their minds; but it has been reserved for a Christian
country to attain this extreme, this quintessence, this absolute of
poignancy. You will understand how vapid are all amusements to a man
who has acquired a taste for this one. The game we play,” he continued,
“is one of extreme simplicity. A full pack—but I perceive you are about
to see the thing in progress. Will you lend me the help of your arm? I
am unfortunately paralysed.”

Indeed, just as Mr. Malthus was beginning his description, another pair
of folding-doors was thrown open, and the whole club began to pass, not
without some hurry, into the adjoining room. It was similar in every
respect to the one from which it was entered, but somewhat differently
furnished. The centre was occupied by a long green table, at which the
President sat shuffling a pack of cards with great particularity. Even
with the stick and the Colonel’s arm, Mr. Malthus walked with so much
difficulty that every one was seated before this pair and the Prince,
who had waited for them, entered the apartment; and, in consequence,
the three took seats close together at the lower end of the board.

“It is a pack of fifty-two,” whispered Mr. Malthus. “Watch for the ace
of spades, which is the sign of death, and the ace of clubs, which
designates the official of the night. Happy, happy young men!” he
added. “You have good eyes, and can follow the game. Alas! I cannot
tell an ace from a deuce across the table.”

And he proceeded to equip himself with a second pair of spectacles.

“I must at least watch the faces,” he explained.

The Colonel rapidly informed his friend of all that he had learned from
the honorary member, and of the horrible alternative that lay before
them. The Prince was conscious of a deadly chill and a contraction
about his heart; he swallowed with difficulty, and looked from side to
side like a man in a maze.

“One bold stroke,” whispered the Colonel, “and we may still escape.”

But the suggestion recalled the Prince’s spirits.

“Silence!” said be. “Let me see that you can play like a gentleman for
any stake, however serious.”

And he looked about him, once more to all appearance at his ease,
although his heart beat thickly, and he was conscious of an unpleasant
heat in his bosom. The members were all very quiet and intent; every
one was pale, but none so pale as Mr. Malthus. His eyes protruded; his
head kept nodding involuntarily upon his spine; his hands found their
way, one after the other, to his mouth, where they made clutches at his
tremulous and ashen lips. It was plain that the honorary member enjoyed
his membership on very startling terms.

“Attention, gentlemen!” said the President.

And he began slowly dealing the cards about the table in the reverse
direction, pausing until each man had shown his card. Nearly every one
hesitated; and sometimes you would see a player’s fingers stumble more
than once before he could turn over the momentous slip of pasteboard.
As the Prince’s turn drew nearer, he was conscious of a growing and
almost suffocating excitement; but he had somewhat of the gambler’s
nature, and recognised almost with astonishment, that there was a
degree of pleasure in his sensations. The nine of clubs fell to his
lot; the three of spades was dealt to Geraldine; and the queen of
hearts to Mr. Malthus, who was unable to suppress a sob of relief. The
young man of the cream tarts almost immediately afterwards turned over
the ace of clubs, and remained frozen with horror, the card still
resting on his finger; he had not come there to kill, but to be killed;
and the Prince in his generous sympathy with his position almost forgot
the peril that still hung over himself and his friend.

The deal was coming round again, and still Death’s card had not come
out. The players held their respiration, and only breathed by gasps.
The Prince received another club; Geraldine had a diamond; but when Mr.
Malthus turned up his card a horrible noise, like that of something
breaking, issued from his mouth; and he rose from his seat and sat down
again, with no sign of his paralysis. It was the ace of spades. The
honorary member had trifled once too often with his terrors.

Conversation broke out again almost at once. The players relaxed their
rigid attitudes, and began to rise from the table and stroll back by
twos and threes into the smoking-room. The President stretched his arms
and yawned, like a man who has finished his day’s work. But Mr. Malthus
sat in his place, with his head in his hands, and his hands upon the
table, drunk and motionless—a thing stricken down.

The Prince and Geraldine made their escape at once. In the cold night
air their horror of what they had witnessed was redoubled.

“Alas!” cried the Prince, “to be bound by an oath in such a matter! to
allow this wholesale trade in murder to be continued with profit and
impunity! If I but dared to forfeit my pledge!”

“That is impossible for your Highness,” replied the Colonel, “whose
honour is the honour of Bohemia. But I dare, and may with propriety,
forfeit mine.”

“Geraldine,” said the Prince, “if your honour suffers in any of the
adventures into which you follow me, not only will I never pardon you,
but—what I believe will much more sensibly affect you—I should never
forgive myself.”

“I receive your Highness’s commands,” replied the Colonel. “Shall we go
from this accursed spot?”

“Yes,” said the Prince. “Call a cab in Heaven’s name, and let me try to
forget in slumber the memory of this night’s disgrace.”

But it was notable that he carefully read the name of the court before
he left it.

The next morning, as soon as the Prince was stirring, Colonel Geraldine
brought him a daily newspaper, with the following paragraph marked:—

“Melancholy Accident.—This morning, about two o’clock, Mr. Bartholomew
Malthus, of 16 Chepstow Place, Westbourne Grove, on his way home from a
party at a friend’s house, fell over the upper parapet in Trafalgar
Square, fracturing his skull and breaking a leg and an arm. Death was
instantaneous. Mr. Malthus, accompanied by a friend, was engaged in
looking for a cab at the time of the unfortunate occurrence. As Mr.
Malthus was paralytic, it is thought that his fall may have been
occasioned by another seizure. The unhappy gentleman was well known in
the most respectable circles, and his loss will be widely and deeply
deplored.”

“If ever a soul went straight to Hell,” said Geraldine solemnly, “it
was that paralytic man’s.”

The Prince buried his face in his hands, and remained silent.

“I am almost rejoiced,” continued the Colonel, “to know that he is
dead. But for our young man of the cream tarts I confess my heart
bleeds.”

“Geraldine,” said the Prince, raising his face, “that unhappy lad was
last night as innocent as you and I; and this morning the guilt of
blood is on his soul. When I think of the President, my heart grows
sick within me. I do not know how it shall be done, but I shall have
that scoundrel at my mercy as there is a God in heaven. What an
experience, what a lesson, was that game of cards!”

“One,” said the Colonel, “never to be repeated.”

The Prince remained so long without replying, that Geraldine grew
alarmed.

“You cannot mean to return,” he said. “You have suffered too much and
seen too much horror already. The duties of your high position forbid
the repetition of the hazard.”

“There is much in what you say,” replied Prince Florizel, “and I am not
altogether pleased with my own determination. Alas! in the clothes of
the greatest potentate, what is there but a man? I never felt my
weakness more acutely than now, Geraldine, but it is stronger than I.
Can I cease to interest myself in the fortunes of the unhappy young man
who supped with us some hours ago? Can I leave the President to follow
his nefarious career unwatched? Can I begin an adventure so entrancing,
and not follow it to an end? No, Geraldine: you ask of the Prince more
than the man is able to perform. To-night, once more, we take our
places at the table of the Suicide Club.”

Colonel Geraldine fell upon his knees.

“Will your Highness take my life?” he cried. “It is his—his freely; but
do not, O do not! let him ask me to countenance so terrible a risk.”

“Colonel Geraldine,” replied the Prince, with some haughtiness of
manner, “your life is absolutely your own. I only looked for obedience;
and when that is unwillingly rendered, I shall look for that no longer.
I add one word: your importunity in this affair has been sufficient.”

The Master of the Horse regained his feet at once.

“Your Highness,” he said, “may I be excused in my attendance this
afternoon? I dare not, as an honourable man, venture a second time into
that fatal house until I have perfectly ordered my affairs. Your
Highness shall meet, I promise him, with no more opposition from the
most devoted and grateful of his servants.”

“My dear Geraldine,” returned Prince Florizel, “I always regret when
you oblige me to remember my rank. Dispose of your day as you think
fit, but be here before eleven in the same disguise.”

The club, on this second evening, was not so fully attended; and when
Geraldine and the Prince arrived, there were not above half-a-dozen
persons in the smoking-room. His Highness took the President aside and
congratulated him warmly on the demise of Mr. Malthus.

“I like,” he said, “to meet with capacity, and certainly find much of
it in you. Your profession is of a very delicate nature, but I see you
are well qualified to conduct it with success and secrecy.”

The President was somewhat affected by these compliments from one of
his Highness’s superior bearing. He acknowledged them almost with
humility.

“Poor Malthy!” he added, “I shall hardly know the club without him. The
most of my patrons are boys, sir, and poetical boys, who are not much
company for me. Not but what Malthy had some poetry, too; but it was of
a kind that I could understand.”

“I can readily imagine you should find yourself in sympathy with Mr.
Malthus,” returned the Prince. “He struck me as a man of a very
original disposition.”

The young man of the cream tarts was in the room, but painfully
depressed and silent. His late companions sought in vain to lead him
into conversation.

“How bitterly I wish,” he cried, “that I had never brought you to this
infamous abode! Begone, while you are clean-handed. If you could have
heard the old man scream as he fell, and the noise of his bones upon
the pavement! Wish me, if you have any kindness to so fallen a
being—wish the ace of spades for me to-night!”

A few more members dropped in as the evening went on, but the club did
not muster more than the devil’s dozen when they took their places at
the table. The Prince was again conscious of a certain joy in his
alarms; but he was astonished to see Geraldine so much more
self-possessed than on the night before.

“It is extraordinary,” thought the Prince, “that a will, made or
unmade, should so greatly influence a young man’s spirit.”

“Attention, gentlemen!” said the President, and he began to deal.

Three times the cards went all round the table, and neither of the
marked cards had yet fallen from his hand. The excitement as he began
the fourth distribution was overwhelming. There were just cards enough
to go once more entirely round. The Prince, who sat second from the
dealer’s left, would receive, in the reverse mode of dealing practised
at the club, the second last card. The third player turned up a black
ace—it was the ace of clubs. The next received a diamond, the next a
heart, and so on; but the ace of spades was still undelivered. At last,
Geraldine, who sat upon the Prince’s left, turned his card; it was an
ace, but the ace of hearts.

When Prince Florizel saw his fate upon the table in front of him, his
heart stood still. He was a brave man, but the sweat poured off his
face. There were exactly fifty chances out of a hundred that he was
doomed. He reversed the card; it was the ace of spades. A loud roaring
filled his brain, and the table swam before his eyes. He heard the
player on his right break into a fit of laughter that sounded between
mirth and disappointment; he saw the company rapidly dispersing, but
his mind was full of other thoughts. He recognised how foolish, how
criminal, had been his conduct. In perfect health, in the prime of his
years, the heir to a throne, he had gambled away his future and that of
a brave and loyal country. “God,” he cried, “God forgive me!” And with
that, the confusion of his senses passed away, and he regained his
self-possession in a moment.

To his surprise Geraldine had disappeared. There was no one in the
card-room but his destined butcher consulting with the President, and
the young man of the cream tarts, who slipped up to the Prince, and
whispered in his ear:—

“I would give a million, if I had it, for your luck.”

His Highness could not help reflecting, as the young man departed, that
he would have sold his opportunity for a much more moderate sum.

The whispered conference now came to an end. The holder of the ace of
clubs left the room with a look of intelligence, and the President,
approaching the unfortunate Prince, proffered him his hand.

“I am pleased to have met you, sir,” said he, “and pleased to have been
in a position to do you this trifling service. At least, you cannot
complain of delay. On the second evening—what a stroke of luck!”

The Prince endeavoured in vain to articulate something in response, but
his mouth was dry and his tongue seemed paralysed.

“You feel a little sickish?” asked the President, with some show of
solicitude. “Most gentlemen do. Will you take a little brandy?”

The Prince signified in the affirmative, and the other immediately
filled some of the spirit into a tumbler.

“Poor old Malthy!” ejaculated the President, as the Prince drained the
glass. “He drank near upon a pint, and little enough good it seemed to
do him!”

“I am more amenable to treatment,” said the Prince, a good deal
revived. “I am my own man again at once, as you perceive. And so, let
me ask you, what are my directions?”

“You will proceed along the Strand in the direction of the City, and on
the left-hand pavement, until you meet the gentleman who has just left
the room. He will continue your instructions, and him you will have the
kindness to obey; the authority of the club is vested in his person for
the night. And now,” added the President, “I wish you a pleasant walk.”

Florizel acknowledged the salutation rather awkwardly, and took his
leave. He passed through the smoking-room, where the bulk of the
players were still consuming champagne, some of which he had himself
ordered and paid for; and he was surprised to find himself cursing them
in his heart. He put on his hat and greatcoat in the cabinet, and
selected his umbrella from a corner. The familiarity of these acts, and
the thought that he was about them for the last time, betrayed him into
a fit of laughter which sounded unpleasantly in his own ears. He
conceived a reluctance to leave the cabinet, and turned instead to the
window. The sight of the lamps and the darkness recalled him to
himself.

“Come, come, I must be a man,” he thought, “and tear myself away.”

At the corner of Box Court three men fell upon Prince Florizel and he
was unceremoniously thrust into a carriage, which at once drove rapidly
away. There was already an occupant.

“Will your Highness pardon my zeal?” said a well known voice.

The Prince threw himself upon the Colonel’s neck in a passion of
relief.

“How can I ever thank you?” he cried. “And how was this effected?”

Although he had been willing to march upon his doom, he was overjoyed
to yield to friendly violence, and return once more to life and hope.

“You can thank me effectually enough,” replied the Colonel, “by
avoiding all such dangers in the future. And as for your second
question, all has been managed by the simplest means. I arranged this
afternoon with a celebrated detective. Secrecy has been promised and
paid for. Your own servants have been principally engaged in the
affair. The house in Box Court has been surrounded since nightfall, and
this, which is one of your own carriages, has been awaiting you for
nearly an hour.”

“And the miserable creature who was to have slain me—what of him?”
inquired the Prince.

“He was pinioned as he left the club,” replied the Colonel, “and now
awaits your sentence at the Palace, where he will soon be joined by his
accomplices.”

“Geraldine,” said the Prince, “you have saved me against my explicit
orders, and you have done well. I owe you not only my life, but a
lesson; and I should be unworthy of my rank if I did not show myself
grateful to my teacher. Let it be yours to choose the manner.”

There was a pause, during which the carriage continued to speed through
the streets, and the two men were each buried in his own reflections.
The silence was broken by Colonel Geraldine.

“Your Highness,” said he, “has by this time a considerable body of
prisoners. There is at least one criminal among the number to whom
justice should be dealt. Our oath forbids us all recourse to law; and
discretion would forbid it equally if the oath were loosened. May I
inquire your Highness’s intention?”

“It is decided,” answered Florizel; “the President must fall in duel.
It only remains to choose his adversary.”

“Your Highness has permitted me to name my own recompense,” said the
Colonel. “Will he permit me to ask the appointment of my brother? It is
an honourable post, but I dare assure your Highness that the lad will
acquit himself with credit.”

“You ask me an ungracious favour,” said the Prince, “but I must refuse
you nothing.”

The Colonel kissed his hand with the greatest affection; and at that
moment the carriage rolled under the archway of the Prince’s splendid
residence.

An hour after, Florizel in his official robes, and covered with all the
orders of Bohemia, received the members of the Suicide Club.

“Foolish and wicked men,” said he, “as many of you as have been driven
into this strait by the lack of fortune shall receive employment and
remuneration from my officers. Those who suffer under a sense of guilt
must have recourse to a higher and more generous Potentate than I. I
feel pity for all of you, deeper than you can imagine; to-morrow you
shall tell me your stories; and as you answer more frankly, I shall be
the more able to remedy your misfortunes. As for you,” he added,
turning to the President, “I should only offend a person of your parts
by any offer of assistance; but I have instead a piece of diversion to
propose to you. Here,” laying his hand on the shoulder of Colonel
Geraldine’s young brother, “is an officer of mine who desires to make a
little tour upon the Continent; and I ask you, as a favour, to
accompany him on this excursion. Do you,” he went on, changing his
tone, “do you shoot well with the pistol? Because you may have need of
that accomplishment. When two men go travelling together, it is best to
be prepared for all. Let me add that, if by any chance you should lose
young Mr. Geraldine upon the way, I shall always have another member of
my household to place at your disposal; and I am known, Mr. President,
to have long eyesight, and as long an arm.”

With these words, said with much sternness, the Prince concluded his
address. Next morning the members of the club were suitably provided
for by his munificence, and the President set forth upon his travels,
under the supervision of Mr. Geraldine, and a pair of faithful and
adroit lackeys, well trained in the Prince’s household. Not content
with this, discreet agents were put in possession of the house in Box
Court, and all letters or visitors for the Suicide Club or its
officials were to be examined by Prince Florizel in person.

STORY OF THE PHYSICIAN AND THE SARATOGA TRUNK


Mr. Silas Q. Scuddamore was a young American of a simple and harmless
disposition, which was the more to his credit as he came from New
England—a quarter of the New World not precisely famous for those
qualities. Although he was exceedingly rich, he kept a note of all his
expenses in a little paper pocket-book; and he had chosen to study the
attractions of Paris from the seventh story of what is called a
furnished hotel, in the Latin Quarter. There was a great deal of habit
in his penuriousness; and his virtue, which was very remarkable among
his associates, was principally founded upon diffidence and youth.

The next room to his was inhabited by a lady, very attractive in her
air and very elegant in toilette, whom, on his first arrival, he had
taken for a Countess. In course of time he had learned that she was
known by the name of Madame Zéphyrine, and that whatever station she
occupied in life it was not that of a person of title. Madame
Zéphyrine, probably in the hope of enchanting the young American, used
to flaunt by him on the stairs with a civil inclination, a word of
course, and a knock-down look out of her black eyes, and disappear in a
rustle of silk, and with the revelation of an admirable foot and ankle.
But these advances, so far from encouraging Mr. Scuddamore, plunged him
into the depths of depression and bashfulness. She had come to him
several times for a light, or to apologise for the imaginary
depredations of her poodle; but his mouth was closed in the presence of
so superior a being, his French promptly left him, and he could only
stare and stammer until she was gone. The slenderness of their
intercourse did not prevent him from throwing out insinuations of a
very glorious order when he was safely alone with a few males.

The room on the other side of the American’s—for there were three rooms
on a floor in the hotel—was tenanted by an old English physician of
rather doubtful reputation. Dr. Noel, for that was his name, had been
forced to leave London, where he enjoyed a large and increasing
practice; and it was hinted that the police had been the instigators of
this change of scene. At least he, who had made something of a figure
in earlier life, now dwelt in the Latin Quarter in great simplicity and
solitude, and devoted much of his time to study. Mr. Scuddamore had
made his acquaintance, and the pair would now and then dine together
frugally in a restaurant across the street.

Silas Q. Scuddamore had many little vices of the more respectable
order, and was not restrained by delicacy from indulging them in many
rather doubtful ways. Chief among his foibles stood curiosity. He was a
born gossip; and life, and especially those parts of it in which he had
no experience, interested him to the degree of passion. He was a pert,
invincible questioner, pushing his inquiries with equal pertinacity and
indiscretion; he had been observed, when he took a letter to the post,
to weigh it in his hand, to turn it over and over, and to study the
address with care; and when he found a flaw in the partition between
his room and Madame Zéphyrine’s, instead of filling it up, he enlarged
and improved the opening, and made use of it as a spy-hole on his
neighbour’s affairs.

One day, in the end of March, his curiosity growing as it was indulged,
he enlarged the hole a little further, so that he might command another
corner of the room. That evening, when he went as usual to inspect
Madame Zéphyrine’s movements, he was astonished to find the aperture
obscured in an odd manner on the other side, and still more abashed
when the obstacle was suddenly withdrawn and a titter of laughter
reached his ears. Some of the plaster had evidently betrayed the secret
of his spy-hole, and his neighbour had been returning the compliment in
kind. Mr. Scuddamore was moved to a very acute feeling of annoyance; he
condemned Madame Zéphyrine unmercifully; he even blamed himself; but
when he found, next day, that she had taken no means to baulk him of
his favourite pastime, he continued to profit by her carelessness, and
gratify his idle curiosity.

That next day Madame Zéphyrine received a long visit from a tall,
loosely-built man of fifty or upwards, whom Silas had not hitherto
seen. His tweed suit and coloured shirt, no less than his shaggy
side-whiskers, identified him as a Britisher, and his dull grey eye
affected Silas with a sense of cold. He kept screwing his mouth from
side to side and round and round during the whole colloquy, which was
carried on in whispers. More than once it seemed to the young New
Englander as if their gestures indicated his own apartment; but the
only thing definite he could gather by the most scrupulous attention
was this remark made by the Englishman in a somewhat higher key, as if
in answer to some reluctance or opposition.

“I have studied his taste to a nicety, and I tell you again and again
you are the only woman of the sort that I can lay my hands on.”

In answer to this, Madame Zéphyrine sighed, and appeared by a gesture
to resign herself, like one yielding to unqualified authority.

That afternoon the observatory was finally blinded, a wardrobe having
been drawn in front of it upon the other side; and while Silas was
still lamenting over this misfortune, which he attributed to the
Britisher’s malign suggestion, the concierge brought him up a letter in
a female handwriting. It was conceived in French of no very rigorous
orthography, bore no signature, and in the most encouraging terms
invited the young American to be present in a certain part of the
Bullier Ball at eleven o’clock that night. Curiosity and timidity
fought a long battle in his heart; sometimes he was all virtue,
sometimes all fire and daring; and the result of it was that, long
before ten, Mr. Silas Q. Scuddamore presented himself in unimpeachable
attire at the door of the Bullier Ball Rooms, and paid his entry money
with a sense of reckless devilry that was not without its charm.

It was Carnival time, and the Ball was very full and noisy. The lights
and the crowd at first rather abashed our young adventurer, and then,
mounting to his brain with a sort of intoxication, put him in
possession of more than his own share of manhood. He felt ready to face
the devil, and strutted in the ballroom with the swagger of a cavalier.
While he was thus parading, he became aware of Madame Zéphyrine and her
Britisher in conference behind a pillar. The cat-like spirit of
eaves-dropping overcame him at once. He stole nearer and nearer on the
couple from behind, until he was within earshot.

“That is the man,” the Britisher was saying; “there—with the long blond
hair—speaking to a girl in green.”

Silas identified a very handsome young fellow of small stature, who was
plainly the object of this designation.

“It is well,” said Madame Zéphyrine. “I shall do my utmost. But,
remember, the best of us may fail in such a matter.”

“Tut!” returned her companion; “I answer for the result. Have I not
chosen you from thirty? Go; but be wary of the Prince. I cannot think
what cursed accident has brought him here to-night. As if there were
not a dozen balls in Paris better worth his notice than this riot of
students and counter-jumpers! See him where he sits, more like a
reigning Emperor at home than a Prince upon his holidays!”

Silas was again lucky. He observed a person of rather a full build,
strikingly handsome, and of a very stately and courteous demeanour,
seated at table with another handsome young man, several years his
junior, who addressed him with conspicuous deference. The name of
Prince struck gratefully on Silas’s Republican hearing, and the aspect
of the person to whom that name was applied exercised its usual charm
upon his mind. He left Madame Zéphyrine and her Englishman to take care
of each other, and threading his way through the assembly, approached
the table which the Prince and his confidant had honoured with their
choice.

“I tell you, Geraldine,” the former was saying, “the action is madness.
Yourself (I am glad to remember it) chose your brother for this
perilous service, and you are bound in duty to have a guard upon his
conduct. He has consented to delay so many days in Paris; that was
already an imprudence, considering the character of the man he has to
deal with; but now, when he is within eight-and-forty hours of his
departure, when he is within two or three days of the decisive trial, I
ask you, is this a place for him to spend his time? He should be in a
gallery at practice; he should be sleeping long hours and taking
moderate exercise on foot; he should be on a rigorous diet, without
white wines or brandy. Does the dog imagine we are all playing comedy?
The thing is deadly earnest, Geraldine.”

“I know the lad too well to interfere,” replied Colonel Geraldine, “and
well enough not to be alarmed. He is more cautious than you fancy, and
of an indomitable spirit. If it had been a woman I should not say so
much, but I trust the President to him and the two valets without an
instant’s apprehension.”

“I am gratified to hear you say so,” replied the Prince; “but my mind
is not at rest. These servants are well-trained spies, and already has
not this miscreant succeeded three times in eluding their observation
and spending several hours on end in private, and most likely
dangerous, affairs? An amateur might have lost him by accident, but if
Rudolph and Jérome were thrown off the scent, it must have been done on
purpose, and by a man who had a cogent reason and exceptional
resources.”

“I believe the question is now one between my brother and myself,”
replied Geraldine, with a shade of offence in his tone.

“I permit it to be so, Colonel Geraldine,” returned Prince Florizel.
“Perhaps, for that very reason, you should be all the more ready to
accept my counsels. But enough. That girl in yellow dances well.”

And the talk veered into the ordinary topics of a Paris ballroom in the
Carnival.

Silas remembered where he was, and that the hour was already near at
hand when he ought to be upon the scene of his assignation. The more he
reflected the less he liked the prospect, and as at that moment an eddy
in the crowd began to draw him in the direction of the door, he
suffered it to carry him away without resistance. The eddy stranded him
in a corner under the gallery, where his ear was immediately struck
with the voice of Madame Zéphyrine. She was speaking in French with the
young man of the blond locks who had been pointed out by the strange
Britisher not half-an-hour before.

“I have a character at stake,” she said, “or I would put no other
condition than my heart recommends. But you have only to say so much to
the porter, and he will let you go by without a word.”

“But why this talk of debt?” objected her companion.

“Heavens!” said she, “do you think I do not understand my own hotel?”

And she went by, clinging affectionately to her companion’s arm.

This put Silas in mind of his billet.

“Ten minutes hence,” thought he, “and I may be walking with as
beautiful a woman as that, and even better dressed—perhaps a real lady,
possibly a woman or title.”

And then he remembered the spelling, and was a little downcast.

“But it may have been written by her maid,” he imagined.

The clock was only a few minutes from the hour, and this immediate
proximity set his heart beating at a curious and rather disagreeable
speed. He reflected with relief that he was in no way bound to put in
an appearance. Virtue and cowardice were together, and he made once
more for the door, but this time of his own accord, and battling
against the stream of people which was now moving in a contrary
direction. Perhaps this prolonged resistance wearied him, or perhaps he
was in that frame of mind when merely to continue in the same
determination for a certain number of minutes produces a reaction and a
different purpose. Certainly, at least, he wheeled about for a third
time, and did not stop until he had found a place of concealment within
a few yards of the appointed place.

Here he went through an agony of spirit, in which he several times
prayed to God for help, for Silas had been devoutly educated. He had
now not the least inclination for the meeting; nothing kept him from
flight but a silly fear lest he should be thought unmanly; but this was
so powerful that it kept head against all other motives; and although
it could not decide him to advance, prevented him from definitely
running away. At last the clock indicated ten minutes past the hour.
Young Scuddamore’s spirit began to rise; he peered round the corner and
saw no one at the place of meeting; doubtless his unknown correspondent
had wearied and gone away. He became as bold as he had formerly been
timid. It seemed to him that if he came at all to the appointment,
however late, he was clear from the charge of cowardice. Nay, now he
began to suspect a hoax, and actually complimented himself on his
shrewdness in having suspected and outmanoeuvred his mystifiers. So
very idle a thing is a boy’s mind!

Armed with these reflections, he advanced boldly from his corner; but
he had not taken above a couple of steps before a hand was laid upon
his arm. He turned and beheld a lady cast in a very large mould and
with somewhat stately features, but bearing no mark of severity in her
looks.

“I see that you are a very self-confident lady-killer,” said she; “for
you make yourself expected. But I was determined to meet you. When a
woman has once so far forgotten herself as to make the first advance,
she has long ago left behind her all considerations of petty pride.”

Silas was overwhelmed by the size and attractions of his correspondent
and the suddenness with which she had fallen upon him. But she soon set
him at his ease. She was very towardly and lenient in her behaviour;
she led him on to make pleasantries, and then applauded him to the
echo; and in a very short time, between blandishments and a liberal
exhibition of warm brandy, she had not only induced him to fancy
himself in love, but to declare his passion with the greatest
vehemence.

“Alas!” she said; “I do not know whether I ought not to deplore this
moment, great as is the pleasure you give me by your words. Hitherto I
was alone to suffer; now, poor boy, there will be two. I am not my own
mistress. I dare not ask you to visit me at my own house, for I am
watched by jealous eyes. Let me see,” she added; “I am older than you,
although so much weaker; and while I trust in your courage and
determination, I must employ my own knowledge of the world for our
mutual benefit. Where do you live?”

He told her that he lodged in a furnished hotel, and named the street
and number.

She seemed to reflect for some minutes, with an effort of mind.

“I see,” she said at last. “You will be faithful and obedient, will you
not?”

Silas assured her eagerly of his fidelity.

“To-morrow night, then,” she continued, with an encouraging smile, “you
must remain at home all the evening; and if any friends should visit
you, dismiss them at once on any pretext that most readily presents
itself. Your door is probably shut by ten?” she asked.

“By eleven,” answered Silas.

“At a quarter past eleven,” pursued the lady, “leave the house. Merely
cry for the door to be opened, and be sure you fall into no talk with
the porter, as that might ruin everything. Go straight to the corner
where the Luxembourg Gardens join the Boulevard; there you will find me
waiting you. I trust you to follow my advice from point to point: and
remember, if you fail me in only one particular, you will bring the
sharpest trouble on a woman whose only fault is to have seen and loved
you.”

“I cannot see the use of all these instructions,” said Silas.

“I believe you are already beginning to treat me as a master,” she
cried, tapping him with her fan upon the arm. “Patience, patience! that
should come in time. A woman loves to be obeyed at first, although
afterwards she finds her pleasure in obeying. Do as I ask you, for
Heaven’s sake, or I will answer for nothing. Indeed, now I think of
it,” she added, with the manner of one who has just seen further into a
difficulty, “I find a better plan of keeping importunate visitors away.
Tell the porter to admit no one for you, except a person who may come
that night to claim a debt; and speak with some feeling, as though you
feared the interview, so that he may take your words in earnest.”

“I think you may trust me to protect myself against intruders,” he
said, not without a little pique.

“That is how I should prefer the thing arranged,” she answered coldly.
“I know you men; you think nothing of a woman’s reputation.”

Silas blushed and somewhat hung his head; for the scheme he had in view
had involved a little vain-glorying before his acquaintances.

“Above all,” she added, “do not speak to the porter as you come out.”

“And why?” said he. “Of all your instructions, that seems to me the
least important.”

“You at first doubted the wisdom of some of the others, which you now
see to be very necessary,” she replied. “Believe me, this also has its
uses; in time you will see them; and what am I to think of your
affection, if you refuse me such trifles at our first interview?”

Silas confounded himself in explanations and apologies; in the middle
of these she looked up at the clock and clapped her hands together with
a suppressed scream.

“Heavens!” she cried, “is it so late? I have not an instant to lose.
Alas, we poor women, what slaves we are! What have I not risked for you
already?”

And after repeating her directions, which she artfully combined with
caresses and the most abandoned looks, she bade him farewell and
disappeared among the crowd.

The whole of the next day Silas was filled with a sense of great
importance; he was now sure she was a countess; and when evening came
he minutely obeyed her orders and was at the corner of the Luxembourg
Gardens by the hour appointed. No one was there. He waited nearly
half-an-hour, looking in the face of every one who passed or loitered
near the spot; he even visited the neighbouring corners of the
Boulevard and made a complete circuit of the garden railings; but there
was no beautiful countess to throw herself into his arms. At last, and
most reluctantly, he began to retrace his steps towards his hotel. On
the way he remembered the words he had heard pass between Madame
Zéphyrine and the blond young man, and they gave him an indefinite
uneasiness.

“It appears,” he reflected, “that every one has to tell lies to our
porter.”

He rang the bell, the door opened before him, and the porter in his
bed-clothes came to offer him a light.

“Has he gone?” inquired the porter.

“He? Whom do you mean?” asked Silas, somewhat sharply, for he was
irritated by his disappointment.

“I did not notice him go out,” continued the porter, “but I trust you
paid him. We do not care, in this house, to have lodgers who cannot
meet their liabilities.”

“What the devil do you mean?” demanded Silas rudely. “I cannot
understand a word of this farrago.”

“The short blond young man who came for his debt,” returned the other.
“Him it is I mean. Who else should it be, when I had your orders to
admit no one else?”

“Why, good God, of course he never came,” retorted Silas.

“I believe what I believe,” returned the porter, putting his tongue
into his cheek with a most roguish air.

“You are an insolent scoundrel,” cried Silas, and, feeling that he had
made a ridiculous exhibition of asperity, and at the same time
bewildered by a dozen alarms, he turned and began to run upstairs.

“Do you not want a light then?” cried the porter.

But Silas only hurried the faster, and did not pause until he had
reached the seventh landing and stood in front of his own door. There
he waited a moment to recover his breath, assailed by the worst
forebodings and almost dreading to enter the room.

When at last he did so he was relieved to find it dark, and to all
appearance, untenanted. He drew a long breath. Here he was, home again
in safety, and this should be his last folly as certainly as it had
been his first. The matches stood on a little table by the bed, and he
began to grope his way in that direction. As he moved, his
apprehensions grew upon him once more, and he was pleased, when his
foot encountered an obstacle, to find it nothing more alarming than a
chair. At last he touched curtains. From the position of the window,
which was faintly visible, he knew he must be at the foot of the bed,
and had only to feel his way along it in order to reach the table in
question.

He lowered his hand, but what it touched was not simply a
counterpane—it was a counterpane with something underneath it like the
outline of a human leg. Silas withdrew his arm and stood a moment
petrified.

“What, what,” he thought, “can this betoken?”

He listened intently, but there was no sound of breathing. Once more,
with a great effort, he reached out the end of his finger to the spot
he had already touched; but this time he leaped back half a yard, and
stood shivering and fixed with terror. There was something in his bed.
What it was he knew not, but there was something there.

It was some seconds before he could move. Then, guided by an instinct,
he fell straight upon the matches, and keeping his back towards the bed
lighted a candle. As soon as the flame had kindled, he turned slowly
round and looked for what he feared to see. Sure enough, there was the
worst of his imaginations realised. The coverlid was drawn carefully up
over the pillow, but it moulded the outline of a human body lying
motionless; and when he dashed forward and flung aside the sheets, he
beheld the blond young man whom he had seen in the Bullier Ball the
night before, his eyes open and without speculation, his face swollen
and blackened, and a thin stream of blood trickling from his nostrils.

Silas uttered a long, tremulous wail, dropped the candle, and fell on
his knees beside the bed.

Silas was awakened from the stupor into which his terrible discovery
had plunged him by a prolonged but discreet tapping at the door. It
took him some seconds to remember his position; and when he hastened to
prevent anyone from entering it was already too late. Dr. Noel, in a
tall night-cap, carrying a lamp which lighted up his long white
countenance, sidling in his gait, and peering and cocking his head like
some sort of bird, pushed the door slowly open, and advanced into the
middle of the room.

“I thought I heard a cry,” began the Doctor, “and fearing you might be
unwell I did not hesitate to offer this intrusion.”

Silas, with a flushed face and a fearful beating heart, kept between
the Doctor and the bed; but he found no voice to answer.

“You are in the dark,” pursued the Doctor; “and yet you have not even
begun to prepare for rest. You will not easily persuade me against my
own eyesight; and your face declares most eloquently that you require
either a friend or a physician—which is it to be? Let me feel your
pulse, for that is often a just reporter of the heart.”

He advanced to Silas, who still retreated before him backwards, and
sought to take him by the wrist; but the strain on the young American’s
nerves had become too great for endurance. He avoided the Doctor with a
febrile movement, and, throwing himself upon the floor, burst into a
flood of weeping.

As soon as Dr. Noel perceived the dead man in the bed his face
darkened; and hurrying back to the door which he had left ajar, he
hastily closed and double-locked it.

“Up!” he cried, addressing Silas in strident tones; “this is no time
for weeping. What have you done? How came this body in your room? Speak
freely to one who may be helpful. Do you imagine I would ruin you? Do
you think this piece of dead flesh on your pillow can alter in any
degree the sympathy with which you have inspired me? Credulous youth,
the horror with which blind and unjust law regards an action never
attaches to the doer in the eyes of those who love him; and if I saw
the friend of my heart return to me out of seas of blood he would be in
no way changed in my affection. Raise yourself,” he said; “good and ill
are a chimera; there is nought in life except destiny, and however you
may be circumstanced there is one at your side who will help you to the
last.”

Thus encouraged, Silas gathered himself together, and in a broken
voice, and helped out by the Doctor’s interrogations, contrived at last
to put him in possession of the facts. But the conversation between the
Prince and Geraldine he altogether omitted, as he had understood little
of its purport, and had no idea that it was in any way related to his
own misadventure.

“Alas!” cried Dr. Noel, “I am much abused, or you have fallen
innocently into the most dangerous hands in Europe. Poor boy, what a
pit has been dug for your simplicity! into what a deadly peril have
your unwary feet been conducted! This man,” he said, “this Englishman,
whom you twice saw, and whom I suspect to be the soul of the
contrivance, can you describe him? Was he young or old? tall or short?”

But Silas, who, for all his curiosity, had not a seeing eye in his
head, was able to supply nothing but meagre generalities, which it was
impossible to recognise.

“I would have it a piece of education in all schools!” cried the Doctor
angrily. “Where is the use of eyesight and articulate speech if a man
cannot observe and recollect the features of his enemy? I, who know all
the gangs of Europe, might have identified him, and gained new weapons
for your defence. Cultivate this art in future, my poor boy; you may
find it of momentous service.”

“The future!” repeated Silas. “What future is there left for me except
the gallows?”

“Youth is but a cowardly season,” returned the Doctor; “and a man’s own
troubles look blacker than they are. I am old, and yet I never
despair.”

“Can I tell such a story to the police?” demanded Silas.

“Assuredly not,” replied the Doctor. “From what I see already of the
machination in which you have been involved, your case is desperate
upon that side; and for the narrow eye of the authorities you are
infallibly the guilty person. And remember that we only know a portion
of the plot; and the same infamous contrivers have doubtless arranged
many other circumstances which would be elicited by a police inquiry,
and help to fix the guilt more certainly upon your innocence.”

“I am then lost, indeed!” cried Silas.

“I have not said so,” answered Dr. Noel “for I am a cautious man.”

“But look at this!” objected Silas, pointing to the body. “Here is this
object in my bed; not to be explained, not to be disposed of, not to be
regarded without horror.”

“Horror?” replied the Doctor. “No. When this sort of clock has run
down, it is no more to me than an ingenious piece of mechanism, to be
investigated with the bistoury. When blood is once cold and stagnant,
it is no longer human blood; when flesh is once dead, it is no longer
that flesh which we desire in our lovers and respect in our friends.
The grace, the attraction, the terror, have all gone from it with the
animating spirit. Accustom yourself to look upon it with composure; for
if my scheme is practicable you will have to live some days in constant
proximity to that which now so greatly horrifies you.”

“Your scheme?” cried Silas. “What is that? Tell me speedily, Doctor;
for I have scarcely courage enough to continue to exist.”

Without replying, Doctor Noel turned towards the bed, and proceeded to
examine the corpse.

“Quite dead,” he murmured. “Yes, as I had supposed, the pockets empty.
Yes, and the name cut off the shirt. Their work has been done
thoroughly and well. Fortunately, he is of small stature.”

Silas followed these words with an extreme anxiety. At last the Doctor,
his autopsy completed, took a chair and addressed the young American
with a smile.

“Since I came into your room,” said he, “although my ears and my tongue
have been so busy, I have not suffered my eyes to remain idle. I noted
a little while ago that you have there, in the corner, one of those
monstrous constructions which your fellow-countrymen carry with them
into all quarters of the globe—in a word, a Saratoga trunk. Until this
moment I have never been able to conceive the utility of these
erections; but then I began to have a glimmer. Whether it was for
convenience in the slave trade, or to obviate the results of too ready
an employment of the bowie-knife, I cannot bring myself to decide. But
one thing I see plainly—the object of such a box is to contain a human
body.

“Surely,” cried Silas, “surely this is not a time for jesting.”

“Although I may express myself with some degree of pleasantry,” replied
the Doctor, “the purport of my words is entirely serious. And the first
thing we have to do, my young friend, is to empty your coffer of all
that it contains.”

Silas, obeying the authority of Doctor Noel, put himself at his
disposition. The Saratoga trunk was soon gutted of its contents, which
made a considerable litter on the floor; and then—Silas taking the
heels and the Doctor supporting the shoulders—the body of the murdered
man was carried from the bed, and, after some difficulty, doubled up
and inserted whole into the empty box. With an effort on the part of
both, the lid was forced down upon this unusual baggage, and the trunk
was locked and corded by the Doctor’s own hand, while Silas disposed of
what had been taken out between the closet and a chest of drawers.

“Now,” said the Doctor, “the first step has been taken on the way to
your deliverance. To-morrow, or rather to-day, it must be your task to
allay the suspicions of your porter, paying him all that you owe; while
you may trust me to make the arrangements necessary to a safe
conclusion. Meantime, follow me to my room, where I shall give you a
safe and powerful opiate; for, whatever you do, you must have rest.”

The next day was the longest in Silas’s memory; it seemed as if it
would never be done. He denied himself to his friends, and sat in a
corner with his eyes fixed upon the Saratoga trunk in dismal
contemplation. His own former indiscretions were now returned upon him
in kind; for the observatory had been once more opened, and he was
conscious of an almost continual study from Madame Zéphyrine’s
apartment. So distressing did this become, that he was at last obliged
to block up the spy-hole from his own side; and when he was thus
secured from observation he spent a considerable portion of his time in
contrite tears and prayer.

Late in the evening Dr. Noel entered the room carrying in his hand a
pair of sealed envelopes without address, one somewhat bulky, and the
other so slim as to seem without enclosure.

“Silas,” he said, seating himself at the table, “the time has now come
for me to explain my plan for your salvation. To-morrow morning, at an
early hour, Prince Florizel of Bohemia returns to London, after having
diverted himself for a few days with the Parisian Carnival. It was my
fortune, a good while ago, to do Colonel Geraldine, his Master of the
Horse, one of those services, so common in my profession, which are
never forgotten upon either side. I have no need to explain to you the
nature of the obligation under which he was laid; suffice it to say
that I knew him ready to serve me in any practicable manner. Now, it
was necessary for you to gain London with your trunk unopened. To this
the Custom House seemed to oppose a fatal difficulty; but I bethought
me that the baggage of so considerable a person as the Prince, is, as a
matter of courtesy, passed without examination by the officers of
Custom. I applied to Colonel Geraldine, and succeeded in obtaining a
favourable answer. To-morrow, if you go before six to the hotel where
the Prince lodges, your baggage will be passed over as a part of his,
and you yourself will make the journey as a member of his suite.”

“It seems to me, as you speak, that I have already seen both the Prince
and Colonel Geraldine; I even overheard some of their conversation the
other evening at the Bullier Ball.”

“It is probable enough; for the Prince loves to mix with all
societies,” replied the Doctor. “Once arrived in London,” he pursued,
“your task is nearly ended. In this more bulky envelope I have given
you a letter which I dare not address; but in the other you will find
the designation of the house to which you must carry it along with your
box, which will there be taken from you and not trouble you any more.”

“Alas!” said Silas, “I have every wish to believe you; but how is it
possible? You open up to me a bright prospect, but, I ask you, is my
mind capable of receiving so unlikely a solution? Be more generous, and
let me further understand your meaning.”

The Doctor seemed painfully impressed.

“Boy,” he answered, “you do not know how hard a thing you ask of me.
But be it so. I am now inured to humiliation; and it would be strange
if I refused you this, after having granted you so much. Know, then,
that although I now make so quiet an appearance—frugal, solitary,
addicted to study—when I was younger, my name was once a rallying-cry
among the most astute and dangerous spirits of London; and while I was
outwardly an object for respect and consideration, my true power
resided in the most secret, terrible, and criminal relations. It is to
one of the persons who then obeyed me that I now address myself to
deliver you from your burden. They were men of many different nations
and dexterities, all bound together by a formidable oath, and working
to the same purposes; the trade of the association was in murder; and I
who speak to you, innocent as I appear, was the chieftain of this
redoubtable crew.”

“What?” cried Silas. “A murderer? And one with whom murder was a trade?
Can I take your hand? Ought I so much as to accept your services? Dark
and criminal old man, would you make an accomplice of my youth and my
distress?”

The Doctor bitterly laughed.

“You are difficult to please, Mr. Scuddamore,” said he; “but I now
offer you your choice of company between the murdered man and the
murderer. If your conscience is too nice to accept my aid, say so, and
I will immediately leave you. Thenceforward you can deal with your
trunk and its belongings as best suits your upright conscience.”

“I own myself wrong,” replied Silas. “I should have remembered how
generously you offered to shield me, even before I had convinced you of
my innocence, and I continue to listen to your counsels with
gratitude.”

“That is well,” returned the Doctor; “and I perceive you are beginning
to learn some of the lessons of experience.”

“At the same time,” resumed the New-Englander, “as you confess yourself
accustomed to this tragical business, and the people to whom you
recommend me are your own former associates and friends, could you not
yourself undertake the transport of the box, and rid me at once of its
detested presence?”

“Upon my word,” replied the Doctor, “I admire you cordially. If you do
not think I have already meddled sufficiently in your concerns, believe
me, from my heart I think the contrary. Take or leave my services as I
offer them; and trouble me with no more words of gratitude, for I value
your consideration even more lightly than I do your intellect. A time
will come, if you should be spared to see a number of years in health
of mind, when you will think differently of all this, and blush for
your to-night’s behaviour.”

So saying, the Doctor arose from his chair, repeated his directions
briefly and clearly, and departed from the room without permitting
Silas any time to answer.

The next morning Silas presented himself at the hotel, where he was
politely received by Colonel Geraldine, and relieved, from that moment,
of all immediate alarm about his trunk and its grisly contents. The
journey passed over without much incident, although the young man was
horrified to overhear the sailors and railway porters complaining among
themselves about the unusual weight of the Prince’s baggage. Silas
travelled in a carriage with the valets, for Prince Florizel chose to
be alone with his Master of the Horse. On board the steamer, however,
Silas attracted his Highness’s attention by the melancholy of his air
and attitude as he stood gazing at the pile of baggage; for he was
still full of disquietude about the future.

“There is a young man,” observed the Prince, “who must have some cause
for sorrow.”

“That,” replied Geraldine, “is the American for whom I obtained
permission to travel with your suite.”

“You remind me that I have been remiss in courtesy,” said Prince
Florizel, and advancing to Silas, he addressed him with the most
exquisite condescension in these words:—“I was charmed, young sir, to
be able to gratify the desire you made known to me through Colonel
Geraldine. Remember, if you please, that I shall be glad at any future
time to lay you under a more serious obligation.”

And he then put some questions as to the political condition of
America, which Silas answered with sense and propriety.

“You are still a young man,” said the Prince; “but I observe you to be
very serious for your years. Perhaps you allow your attention to be too
much occupied with grave studies. But, perhaps, on the other hand, I am
myself indiscreet and touch upon a painful subject.”

“I have certainly cause to be the most miserable of men,” said Silas;
“never has a more innocent person been more dismally abused.”

“I will not ask you for your confidence,” returned Prince Florizel.
“But do not forget that Colonel Geraldine’s recommendation is an
unfailing passport; and that I am not only willing, but possibly more
able than many others, to do you a service.”

Silas was delighted with the amiability of this great personage; but
his mind soon returned upon its gloomy preoccupations; for not even the
favour of a Prince to a Republican can discharge a brooding spirit of
its cares.

The train arrived at Charing Cross, where the officers of the Revenue
respected the baggage of Prince Florizel in the usual manner. The most
elegant equipages were in waiting; and Silas was driven, along with the
rest, to the Prince’s residence. There Colonel Geraldine sought him
out, and expressed himself pleased to have been of any service to a
friend of the physician’s, for whom he professed a great consideration.

“I hope,” he added, “that you will find none of your porcelain injured.
Special orders were given along the line to deal tenderly with the
Prince’s effects.”

And then, directing the servants to place one of the carriages at the
young gentleman’s disposal, and at once to charge the Saratoga trunk
upon the dickey, the Colonel shook hands and excused himself on account
of his occupations in the princely household.

Silas now broke the seal of the envelope containing the address, and
directed the stately footman to drive him to Box Court, opening off the
Strand. It seemed as if the place were not at all unknown to the man,
for he looked startled and begged a repetition of the order. It was
with a heart full of alarms, that Silas mounted into the luxurious
vehicle, and was driven to his destination. The entrance to Box Court
was too narrow for the passage of a coach; it was a mere footway
between railings, with a post at either end. On one of these posts was
seated a man, who at once jumped down and exchanged a friendly sign
with the driver, while the footman opened the door and inquired of
Silas whether he should take down the Saratoga trunk, and to what
number it should be carried.

“If you please,” said Silas. “To number three.”

The footman and the man who had been sitting on the post, even with the
aid of Silas himself, had hard work to carry in the trunk; and before
it was deposited at the door of the house in question, the young
American was horrified to find a score of loiterers looking on. But he
knocked with as good a countenance as he could muster up, and presented
the other envelope to him who opened.

“He is not at home,” said he, “but if you will leave your letter and
return to-morrow early, I shall be able to inform you whether and when
he can receive your visit. Would you like to leave your box?” he added.

“Dearly,” cried Silas; and the next moment he repented his
precipitation, and declared, with equal emphasis, that he would rather
carry the box along with him to the hotel.

The crowd jeered at his indecision and followed him to the carriage
with insulting remarks; and Silas, covered with shame and terror,
implored the servants to conduct him to some quiet and comfortable
house of entertainment in the immediate neighbourhood.

The Prince’s equipage deposited Silas at the Craven Hotel in Craven
Street, and immediately drove away, leaving him alone with the servants
of the inn. The only vacant room, it appeared, was a little den up four
pairs of stairs, and looking towards the back. To this hermitage, with
infinite trouble and complaint, a pair of stout porters carried the
Saratoga trunk. It is needless to mention that Silas kept closely at
their heels throughout the ascent, and had his heart in his mouth at
every corner. A single false step, he reflected, and the box might go
over the banisters and land its fatal contents, plainly discovered, on
the pavement of the hall.

Arrived in the room, he sat down on the edge of his bed to recover from
the agony that he had just endured; but he had hardly taken his
position when he was recalled to a sense of his peril by the action of
the boots, who had knelt beside the trunk, and was proceeding
officiously to undo its elaborate fastenings.

“Let it be!” cried Silas. “I shall want nothing from it while I stay
here.”

“You might have let it lie in the hall, then,” growled the man; “a
thing as big and heavy as a church. What you have inside I cannot
fancy. If it is all money, you are a richer man than me.”

“Money?” repeated Silas, in a sudden perturbation. “What do you mean by
money? I have no money, and you are speaking like a fool.”

“All right, captain,” retorted the boots with a wink. “There’s nobody
will touch your lordship’s money. I’m as safe as the bank,” he added;
“but as the box is heavy, I shouldn’t mind drinking something to your
lordship’s health.”

Silas pressed two Napoleons upon his acceptance, apologising, at the
same time, for being obliged to trouble him with foreign money, and
pleading his recent arrival for excuse. And the man, grumbling with
even greater fervour, and looking contemptuously from the money in his
hand to the Saratoga trunk and back again from the one to the other, at
last consented to withdraw.

For nearly two days the dead body had been packed into Silas’s box; and
as soon as he was alone the unfortunate New-Englander nosed all the
cracks and openings with the most passionate attention. But the weather
was cool, and the trunk still managed to contain his shocking secret.

He took a chair beside it, and buried his face in his hands, and his
mind in the most profound reflection. If he were not speedily relieved,
no question but he must be speedily discovered. Alone in a strange
city, without friends or accomplices, if the Doctor’s introduction
failed him, he was indubitably a lost New-Englander. He reflected
pathetically over his ambitious designs for the future; he should not
now become the hero and spokesman of his native place of Bangor, Maine;
he should not, as he had fondly anticipated, move on from office to
office, from honour to honour; he might as well divest himself at once
of all hope of being acclaimed President of the United States, and
leaving behind him a statue, in the worst possible style of art, to
adorn the Capitol at Washington. Here he was, chained to a dead
Englishman doubled up inside a Saratoga trunk; whom he must get rid of,
or perish from the rolls of national glory!

I should be afraid to chronicle the language employed by this young man
to the Doctor, to the murdered man, to Madame Zéphyrine, to the boots
of the hotel, to the Prince’s servants, and, in a word, to all who had
been ever so remotely connected with his horrible misfortune.

He slunk down to dinner about seven at night; but the yellow
coffee-room appalled him, the eyes of the other diners seemed to rest
on his with suspicion, and his mind remained upstairs with the Saratoga
trunk. When the waiter came to offer him cheese, his nerves were
already so much on edge that he leaped half-way out of his chair and
upset the remainder of a pint of ale upon the table-cloth.

The fellow offered to show him to the smoking-room when he had done;
and although he would have much preferred to return at once to his
perilous treasure, he had not the courage to refuse, and was shown
downstairs to the black, gas-lit cellar, which formed, and possibly
still forms, the divan of the Craven Hotel.

Two very sad betting men were playing billiards, attended by a moist,
consumptive marker; and for the moment Silas imagined that these were
the only occupants of the apartment. But at the next glance his eye
fell upon a person smoking in the farthest corner, with lowered eyes
and a most respectable and modest aspect. He knew at once that he had
seen the face before; and, in spite of the entire change of clothes,
recognised the man whom he had found seated on a post at the entrance
to Box Court, and who had helped him to carry the trunk to and from the
carriage. The New-Englander simply turned and ran, nor did he pause
until he had locked and bolted himself into his bedroom.

There, all night long, a prey to the most terrible imaginations, he
watched beside the fatal boxful of dead flesh. The suggestion of the
boots that his trunk was full of gold inspired him with all manner of
new terrors, if he so much as dared to close an eye; and the presence
in the smoking-room, and under an obvious disguise, of the loiterer
from Box Court convinced him that he was once more the centre of
obscure machinations.

Midnight had sounded some time, when, impelled by uneasy suspicions,
Silas opened his bedroom door and peered into the passage. It was dimly
illuminated by a single jet of gas; and some distance off he perceived
a man sleeping on the floor in the costume of an hotel under-servant.
Silas drew near the man on tiptoe. He lay partly on his back, partly on
his side, and his right forearm concealed his face from recognition.
Suddenly, while the American was still bending over him, the sleeper
removed his arm and opened his eyes, and Silas found himself once more
face to face with the loiterer of Box Court.

“Good-night, sir,” said the man, pleasantly.

But Silas was too profoundly moved to find an answer, and regained his
room in silence.

Towards morning, worn out by apprehension, he fell asleep on his chair,
with his head forward on the trunk. In spite of so constrained an
attitude and such a grisly pillow, his slumber was sound and prolonged,
and he was only awakened at a late hour and by a sharp tapping at the
door.

He hurried to open, and found the boots without.

“You are the gentleman who called yesterday at Box Court?” he asked.

Silas, with a quaver, admitted that he had done so.

“Then this note is for you,” added the servant, proffering a sealed
envelope.

Silas tore it open, and found inside the words: “Twelve o’clock.”

He was punctual to the hour; the trunk was carried before him by
several stout servants; and he was himself ushered into a room, where a
man sat warming himself before the fire with his back towards the door.
The sound of so many persons entering and leaving, and the scraping of
the trunk as it was deposited upon the bare boards, were alike unable
to attract the notice of the occupant; and Silas stood waiting, in an
agony of fear, until he should deign to recognise his presence.

Perhaps five minutes had elapsed before the man turned leisurely about,
and disclosed the features of Prince Florizel of Bohemia.

“So, sir,” he said, with great severity, “this is the manner in which
you abuse my politeness. You join yourselves to persons of condition, I
perceive, for no other purpose than to escape the consequences of your
crimes; and I can readily understand your embarrassment when I
addressed myself to you yesterday.”

“Indeed,” cried Silas, “I am innocent of everything except misfortune.”

And in a hurried voice, and with the greatest ingenuousness, he
recounted to the Prince the whole history of his calamity.

“I see I have been mistaken,” said his Highness, when he had heard him
to an end. “You are no other than a victim, and since I am not to
punish you may be sure I shall do my utmost to help. And now,” he
continued, “to business. Open your box at once, and let me see what it
contains.”

Silas changed colour.

“I almost fear to look upon it,” he exclaimed.

“Nay,” replied the Prince, “have you not looked at it already? This is
a form of sentimentality to be resisted. The sight of a sick man, whom
we can still help, should appeal more directly to the feelings than
that of a dead man who is equally beyond help or harm, love or hatred.
Nerve yourself, Mr. Scuddamore,” and then, seeing that Silas still
hesitated, “I do not desire to give another name to my request,” he
added.

The young American awoke as if out of a dream, and with a shiver of
repugnance addressed himself to loose the straps and open the lock of
the Saratoga trunk. The Prince stood by, watching with a composed
countenance and his hands behind his back. The body was quite stiff,
and it cost Silas a great effort, both moral and physical, to dislodge
it from its position, and discover the face.

Prince Florizel started back with an exclamation of painful surprise.

“Alas!” he cried, “you little know, Mr. Scuddamore, what a cruel gift
you have brought me. This is a young man of my own suite, the brother
of my trusted friend; and it was upon matters of my own service that he
has thus perished at the hands of violent and treacherous men. Poor
Geraldine,” he went on, as if to himself, “in what words am I to tell
you of your brother’s fate? How can I excuse myself in your eyes, or in
the eyes of God, for the presumptuous schemes that led him to this
bloody and unnatural death? Ah, Florizel! Florizel! when will you learn
the discretion that suits mortal life, and be no longer dazzled with
the image of power at your disposal? Power!” he cried; “who is more
powerless? I look upon this young man whom I have sacrificed, Mr.
Scuddamore, and feel how small a thing it is to be a Prince.”

Silas was moved at the sight of his emotion. He tried to murmur some
consolatory words, and burst into tears.

The Prince, touched by his obvious intention, came up to him and took
him by the hand.

“Command yourself,” said he. “We have both much to learn, and we shall
both be better men for to-day’s meeting.”

Silas thanked him in silence with an affectionate look.

“Write me the address of Doctor Noel on this piece of paper,” continued
the Prince, leading him towards the table; “and let me recommend you,
when you are again in Paris, to avoid the society of that dangerous
man. He has acted in this matter on a generous inspiration; that I must
believe; had he been privy to young Geraldine’s death he would never
have despatched the body to the care of the actual criminal.”

“The actual criminal!” repeated Silas in astonishment.

“Even so,” returned the Prince. “This letter, which the disposition of
Almighty Providence has so strangely delivered into my hands, was
addressed to no less a person than the criminal himself, the infamous
President of the Suicide Club. Seek to pry no further in these perilous
affairs, but content yourself with your own miraculous escape, and
leave this house at once. I have pressing affairs, and must arrange at
once about this poor clay, which was so lately a gallant and handsome
youth.”

Silas took a grateful and submissive leave of Prince Florizel, but he
lingered in Box Court until he saw him depart in a splendid carriage on
a visit to Colonel Henderson of the police. Republican as he was, the
young American took off his hat with almost a sentiment of devotion to
the retreating carriage. And the same night he started by rail on his
return to Paris.


_Here_ (observes my Arabian author) _is the end of_ The History of the
Physician and the Saratoga Trunk. _Omitting some reflections on the
power of Providence_, _highly pertinent in the original_, _but little
suited to our occiddental taste_, _I shall only add that Mr. Scuddamore
has already begun to mount the ladder of political fame_, _and by last
advices was the Sheriff of his native town_.




THE ADVENTURE OF THE HANSOM CABS


Lieutenant Brackenbury Rich had greatly distinguished himself in one of
the lesser Indian hill wars. He it was who took the chieftain prisoner
with his own hand; his gallantry was universally applauded; and when he
came home, prostrated by an ugly sabre cut and a protracted jungle
fever, society was prepared to welcome the Lieutenant as a celebrity of
minor lustre. But his was a character remarkable for unaffected
modesty; adventure was dear to his heart, but he cared little for
adulation; and he waited at foreign watering-places and in Algiers
until the fame of his exploits had run through its nine days’ vitality
and begun to be forgotten. He arrived in London at last, in the early
season, with as little observation as he could desire; and as he was an
orphan and had none but distant relatives who lived in the provinces,
it was almost as a foreigner that he installed himself in the capital
of the country for which he had shed his blood.

On the day following his arrival he dined alone at a military club. He
shook hands with a few old comrades, and received their warm
congratulations; but as one and all had some engagement for the
evening, he found himself left entirely to his own resources. He was in
dress, for he had entertained the notion of visiting a theatre. But the
great city was new to him; he had gone from a provincial school to a
military college, and thence direct to the Eastern Empire; and he
promised himself a variety of delights in this world for exploration.
Swinging his cane, he took his way westward. It was a mild evening,
already dark, and now and then threatening rain. The succession of
faces in the lamplight stirred the Lieutenant’s imagination; and it
seemed to him as if he could walk for ever in that stimulating city
atmosphere and surrounded by the mystery of four million private lives.
He glanced at the houses, and marvelled what was passing behind those
warmly-lighted windows; he looked into face after face, and saw them
each intent upon some unknown interest, criminal or kindly.

“They talk of war,” he thought, “but this is the great battlefield of
mankind.”

And then he began to wonder that he should walk so long in this
complicated scene, and not chance upon so much as the shadow of an
adventure for himself.

“All in good time,” he reflected. “I am still a stranger, and perhaps
wear a strange air. But I must be drawn into the eddy before long.”

The night was already well advanced when a plump of cold rain fell
suddenly out of the darkness. Brackenbury paused under some trees, and
as he did so he caught sight of a hansom cabman making him a sign that
he was disengaged. The circumstance fell in so happily to the occasion
that he at once raised his cane in answer, and had soon ensconced
himself in the London gondola.

“Where to, sir?” asked the driver.

“Where you please,” said Brackenbury.

And immediately, at a pace of surprising swiftness, the hansom drove
off through the rain into a maze of villas. One villa was so like
another, each with its front garden, and there was so little to
distinguish the deserted lamp-lit streets and crescents through which
the flying hansom took its way, that Brackenbury soon lost all idea of
direction.

He would have been tempted to believe that the cabman was amusing
himself by driving him round and round and in and out about a small
quarter, but there was something business-like in the speed which
convinced him of the contrary. The man had an object in view, he was
hastening towards a definite end; and Brackenbury was at once
astonished at the fellow’s skill in picking a way through such a
labyrinth, and a little concerned to imagine what was the occasion of
his hurry. He had heard tales of strangers falling ill in London. Did
the driver belong to some bloody and treacherous association? and was
he himself being whirled to a murderous death?

The thought had scarcely presented itself, when the cab swung sharply
round a corner and pulled up before the garden gate of a villa in a
long and wide road. The house was brilliantly lighted up. Another
hansom had just driven away, and Brackenbury could see a gentleman
being admitted at the front door and received by several liveried
servants. He was surprised that the cabman should have stopped so
immediately in front of a house where a reception was being held; but
he did not doubt it was the result of accident, and sat placidly
smoking where he was, until he heard the trap thrown open over his
head.

“Here we are, sir,” said the driver.

“Here!” repeated Brackenbury. “Where?”

“You told me to take you where I pleased, sir,” returned the man with a
chuckle, “and here we are.”

It struck Brackenbury that the voice was wonderfully smooth and
courteous for a man in so inferior a position; he remembered the speed
at which he had been driven; and now it occurred to him that the hansom
was more luxuriously appointed than the common run of public
conveyances.

“I must ask you to explain,” said he. “Do you mean to turn me out into
the rain? My good man, I suspect the choice is mine.”

“The choice is certainly yours,” replied the driver; “but when I tell
you all, I believe I know how a gentleman of your figure will decide.
There is a gentlemen’s party in this house. I do not know whether the
master be a stranger to London and without acquaintances of his own; or
whether he is a man of odd notions. But certainly I was hired to kidnap
single gentlemen in evening dress, as many as I pleased, but military
officers by preference. You have simply to go in and say that Mr.
Morris invited you.”

“Are you Mr. Morris?” inquired the Lieutenant.

“Oh, no,” replied the cabman. “Mr. Morris is the person of the house.”

“It is not a common way of collecting guests,” said Brackenbury: “but
an eccentric man might very well indulge the whim without any intention
to offend. And suppose that I refuse Mr. Morris’s invitation,” he went
on, “what then?”

“My orders are to drive you back where I took you from,” replied the
man, “and set out to look for others up to midnight. Those who have no
fancy for such an adventure, Mr. Morris said, were not the guests for
him.”

These words decided the Lieutenant on the spot.

“After all,” he reflected, as he descended from the hansom, “I have not
had long to wait for my adventure.”

He had hardly found footing on the side-walk, and was still feeling in
his pocket for the fare, when the cab swung about and drove off by the
way it came at the former break-neck velocity. Brackenbury shouted
after the man, who paid no heed, and continued to drive away; but the
sound of his voice was overheard in the house, the door was again
thrown open, emitting a flood of light upon the garden, and a servant
ran down to meet him holding an umbrella.

“The cabman has been paid,” observed the servant in a very civil tone;
and he proceeded to escort Brackenbury along the path and up the steps.
In the hall several other attendants relieved him of his hat, cane, and
paletot, gave him a ticket with a number in return, and politely
hurried him up a stair adorned with tropical flowers, to the door of an
apartment on the first storey. Here a grave butler inquired his name,
and announcing “Lieutenant Brackenbury Rich,” ushered him into the
drawing-room of the house.

A young man, slender and singularly handsome, came forward and greeted
him with an air at once courtly and affectionate. Hundreds of candles,
of the finest wax, lit up a room that was perfumed, like the staircase,
with a profusion of rare and beautiful flowering shrubs. A side-table
was loaded with tempting viands. Several servants went to and fro with
fruits and goblets of champagne. The company was perhaps sixteen in
number, all men, few beyond the prime of life, and with hardly an
exception, of a dashing and capable exterior. They were divided into
two groups, one about a roulette board, and the other surrounding a
table at which one of their number held a bank of baccarat.

“I see,” thought Brackenbury, “I am in a private gambling saloon, and
the cabman was a tout.”

His eye had embraced the details, and his mind formed the conclusion,
while his host was still holding him by the hand; and to him his looks
returned from this rapid survey. At a second view Mr. Morris surprised
him still more than on the first. The easy elegance of his manners, the
distinction, amiability, and courage that appeared upon his features,
fitted very ill with the Lieutenant’s preconceptions on the subject of
the proprietor of a hell; and the tone of his conversation seemed to
mark him out for a man of position and merit. Brackenbury found he had
an instinctive liking for his entertainer; and though he chid himself
for the weakness, he was unable to resist a sort of friendly attraction
for Mr. Morris’s person and character.

“I have heard of you, Lieutenant Rich,” said Mr. Morris, lowering his
tone; “and believe me I am gratified to make your acquaintance. Your
looks accord with the reputation that has preceded you from India. And
if you will forget for a while the irregularity of your presentation in
my house, I shall feel it not only an honour, but a genuine pleasure
besides. A man who makes a mouthful of barbarian cavaliers,” he added
with a laugh, “should not be appalled by a breach of etiquette, however
serious.”

And he led him towards the sideboard and pressed him to partake of some
refreshment.

“Upon my word,” the Lieutenant reflected, “this is one of the
pleasantest fellows and, I do not doubt, one of the most agreeable
societies in London.”

He partook of some champagne, which he found excellent; and observing
that many of the company were already smoking, he lit one of his own
Manillas, and strolled up to the roulette board, where he sometimes
made a stake and sometimes looked on smilingly on the fortune of
others. It was while he was thus idling that he became aware of a sharp
scrutiny to which the whole of the guests were subjected. Mr. Morris
went here and there, ostensibly busied on hospitable concerns; but he
had ever a shrewd glance at disposal; not a man of the party escaped
his sudden, searching looks; he took stock of the bearing of heavy
losers, he valued the amount of the stakes, he paused behind couples
who were deep in conversation; and, in a word, there was hardly a
characteristic of any one present but he seemed to catch and make a
note of it. Brackenbury began to wonder if this were indeed a gambling
hell: it had so much the air of a private inquisition. He followed Mr.
Morris in all his movements; and although the man had a ready smile, he
seemed to perceive, as it were under a mask, a haggard, careworn, and
preoccupied spirit. The fellows around him laughed and made their game;
but Brackenbury had lost interest in the guests.

“This Morris,” thought he, “is no idler in the room. Some deep purpose
inspires him; let it be mine to fathom it.”

Now and then Mr. Morris would call one of his visitors aside; and after
a brief colloquy in an ante-room, he would return alone, and the
visitors in question reappeared no more. After a certain number of
repetitions, this performance excited Brackenbury’s curiosity to a high
degree. He determined to be at the bottom of this minor mystery at
once; and strolling into the ante-room, found a deep window recess
concealed by curtains of the fashionable green. Here he hurriedly
ensconced himself; nor had he to wait long before the sound of steps
and voices drew near him from the principal apartment. Peering through
the division, he saw Mr. Morris escorting a fat and ruddy personage,
with somewhat the look of a commercial traveller, whom Brackenbury had
already remarked for his coarse laugh and under-bred behaviour at the
table. The pair halted immediately before the window, so that
Brackenbury lost not a word of the following discourse:—

“I beg you a thousand pardons!” began Mr. Morris, with the most
conciliatory manner; “and, if I appear rude, I am sure you will readily
forgive me. In a place so great as London accidents must continually
happen; and the best that we can hope is to remedy them with as small
delay as possible. I will not deny that I fear you have made a mistake
and honoured my poor house by inadvertence; for, to speak openly, I
cannot at all remember your appearance. Let me put the question without
unnecessary circumlocution—between gentlemen of honour a word will
suffice—Under whose roof do you suppose yourself to be?”

“That of Mr. Morris,” replied the other, with a prodigious display of
confusion, which had been visibly growing upon him throughout the last
few words.

“Mr. John or Mr. James Morris?” inquired the host.

“I really cannot tell you,” returned the unfortunate guest. “I am not
personally acquainted with the gentleman, any more than I am with
yourself.”

“I see,” said Mr. Morris. “There is another person of the same name
farther down the street; and I have no doubt the policeman will be able
to supply you with his number. Believe me, I felicitate myself on the
misunderstanding which has procured me the pleasure of your company for
so long; and let me express a hope that we may meet again upon a more
regular footing. Meantime, I would not for the world detain you longer
from your friends. John,” he added, raising his voice, “will you see
that this gentleman finds his great-coat?”

And with the most agreeable air Mr. Morris escorted his visitor as far
as the ante-room door, where he left him under conduct of the butler.
As he passed the window, on his return to the drawing-room, Brackenbury
could hear him utter a profound sigh, as though his mind was loaded
with a great anxiety, and his nerves already fatigued with the task on
which he was engaged.

For perhaps an hour the hansoms kept arriving with such frequency, that
Mr. Morris had to receive a new guest for every old one that he sent
away, and the company preserved its number undiminished. But towards
the end of that time the arrivals grew few and far between, and at
length ceased entirely, while the process of elimination was continued
with unimpaired activity. The drawing-room began to look empty: the
baccarat was discontinued for lack of a banker; more than one person
said good-night of his own accord, and was suffered to depart without
expostulation; and in the meanwhile Mr. Morris redoubled in agreeable
attentions to those who stayed behind. He went from group to group and
from person to person with looks of the readiest sympathy and the most
pertinent and pleasing talk; he was not so much like a host as like a
hostess, and there was a feminine coquetry and condescension in his
manner which charmed the hearts of all.

As the guests grew thinner, Lieutenant Rich strolled for a moment out
of the drawing-room into the hall in quest of fresher air. But he had
no sooner passed the threshold of the ante-chamber than he was brought
to a dead halt by a discovery of the most surprising nature. The
flowering shrubs had disappeared from the staircase; three large
furniture waggons stood before the garden gate; the servants were busy
dismantling the house upon all sides; and some of them had already
donned their great-coats and were preparing to depart. It was like the
end of a country ball, where everything has been supplied by contract.
Brackenbury had indeed some matter for reflection. First, the guests,
who were no real guests after all, had been dismissed; and now the
servants, who could hardly be genuine servants, were actively
dispersing.

‘“Was the whole establishment a sham?” he asked himself. “The mushroom
of a single night which should disappear before morning?”

Watching a favourable opportunity, Brackenbury dashed upstairs to the
highest regions of the house. It was as he had expected. He ran from
room to room, and saw not a stick of furniture nor so much as a picture
on the walls. Although the house had been painted and papered, it was
not only uninhabited at present, but plainly had never been inhabited
at all. The young officer remembered with astonishment its specious,
settled, and hospitable air on his arrival. It was only at a prodigious
cost that the imposture could have been carried out upon so great a
scale.

Who, then, was Mr. Morris? What was his intention in thus playing the
householder for a single night in the remote west of London? And why
did he collect his visitors at hazard from the streets?

Brackenbury remembered that he had already delayed too long, and
hastened to join the company. Many had left during his absence; and
counting the Lieutenant and his host, there were not more than five
persons in the drawing-room—recently so thronged. Mr. Morris greeted
him, as he re-entered the apartment, with a smile, and immediately rose
to his feet.

“It is now time, gentlemen,” said he, “to explain my purpose in
decoying you from your amusements. I trust you did not find the evening
hang very dully on your hands; but my object, I will confess it, was
not to entertain your leisure, but to help myself in an unfortunate
necessity. You are all gentlemen,” he continued, “your appearance does
you that much justice, and I ask for no better security. Hence, I speak
it without concealment, I ask you to render me a dangerous and delicate
service; dangerous because you may run the hazard of your lives, and
delicate because I must ask an absolute discretion upon all that you
shall see or hear. From an utter stranger the request is almost
comically extravagant; I am well aware of this; and I would add at
once, if there be any one present who has heard enough, if there be one
among the party who recoils from a dangerous confidence and a piece of
Quixotic devotion to he knows not whom—here is my hand ready, and I
shall wish him good-night and God-speed with all the sincerity in the
world.”

A very tall, black man, with a heavy stoop, immediately responded to
this appeal.

“I commend your frankness, Sir,” said he; “and, for my part, I go. I
make no reflections; but I cannot deny that you fill me with suspicious
thoughts. I go myself, as I say; and perhaps you will think I have no
right to add words to my example.”

“On the contrary,” replied Mr. Morris, “I am obliged to you for all you
say. It would be impossible to exaggerate the gravity of my proposal.”

“Well, gentlemen, what do you say?” said the tall man, addressing the
others. “We have had our evening’s frolic; shall we all go homeward
peaceably in a body? You will think well of my suggestion in the
morning, when you see the sun again in innocence and safety.”

The speaker pronounced the last words with an intonation which added to
their force; and his face wore a singular expression, full of gravity
and significance. Another of the company rose hastily, and, with some
appearance of alarm, prepared to take his leave. There were only two
who held their ground, Brackenbury and an old red-nosed cavalry Major;
but these two preserved a nonchalant demeanour, and, beyond a look of
intelligence which they rapidly exchanged, appeared entirely foreign to
the discussion that had just been terminated.

Mr. Morris conducted the deserters as far as the door, which he closed
upon their heels; then he turned round, disclosing a countenance of
mingled relief and animation, and addressed the two officers as
follows.

“I have chosen my men like Joshua in the Bible,” said Mr. Morris, “and
I now believe I have the pick of London. Your appearance pleased my
hansom cabmen; then it delighted me; I have watched your behaviour in a
strange company, and under the most unusual circumstances: I have
studied how you played and how you bore your losses; lastly, I have put
you to the test of a staggering announcement, and you received it like
an invitation to dinner. It is not for nothing,” he cried, “that I have
been for years the companion and the pupil of the bravest and wisest
potentate in Europe.”

“At the affair of Bunderchang,” observed the Major, “I asked for twelve
volunteers, and every trooper in the ranks replied to my appeal. But a
gaming party is not the same thing as a regiment under fire. You may be
pleased, I suppose, to have found two, and two who will not fail you at
a push. As for the pair who ran away, I count them among the most
pitiful hounds I ever met with. Lieutenant Rich,” he added, addressing
Brackenbury, “I have heard much of you of late; and I cannot doubt but
you have also heard of me. I am Major O’Rooke.”

And the veteran tendered his hand, which was red and tremulous, to the
young Lieutenant.

“Who has not?” answered Brackenbury.

“When this little matter is settled,” said Mr. Morris, “you will think
I have sufficiently rewarded you; for I could offer neither a more
valuable service than to make him acquainted with the other.”

“And now,” said Major O’Rooke, “is it a duel?”

“A duel after a fashion,” replied Mr. Morris, “a duel with unknown and
dangerous enemies, and, as I gravely fear, a duel to the death. I must
ask you,” he continued, “to call me Morris no longer; call me, if you
please, Hammersmith; my real name, as well as that of another person to
whom I hope to present you before long, you will gratify me by not
asking and not seeking to discover for yourselves. Three days ago the
person of whom I speak disappeared suddenly from home; and, until this
morning, I received no hint of his situation. You will fancy my alarm
when I tell you that he is engaged upon a work of private justice.
Bound by an unhappy oath, too lightly sworn, he finds it necessary,
without the help of law, to rid the earth of an insidious and bloody
villain. Already two of our friends, and one of them my own born
brother, have perished in the enterprise. He himself, or I am much
deceived, is taken in the same fatal toils. But at least he still lives
and still hopes, as this billet sufficiently proves.”

And the speaker, no other than Colonel Geraldine, proffered a letter,
thus conceived:—

“Major Hammersmith,—On Wednesday, at 3 A.M., you will be admitted by
the small door to the gardens of Rochester House, Regent’s Park, by a
man who is entirely in my interest. I must request you not to fail me
by a second. Pray bring my case of swords, and, if you can find them,
one or two gentlemen of conduct and discretion to whom my person is
unknown. My name must not be used in this affair.


T. Godall.”


“From his wisdom alone, if he had no other title,” pursued Colonel
Geraldine, when the others had each satisfied his curiosity, “my friend
is a man whose directions should implicitly be followed. I need not
tell you, therefore, that I have not so much as visited the
neighbourhood of Rochester House; and that I am still as wholly in the
dark as either of yourselves as to the nature of my friend’s dilemma. I
betook myself, as soon as I had received this order, to a furnishing
contractor, and, in a few hours, the house in which we now are had
assumed its late air of festival. My scheme was at least original; and
I am far from regretting an action which has procured me the services
of Major O’Rooke and Lieutenant Brackenbury Rich. But the servants in
the street will have a strange awakening. The house which this evening
was full of lights and visitors they will find uninhabited and for sale
to-morrow morning. Thus even the most serious concerns,” added the
Colonel, “have a merry side.”

“And let us add a merry ending,” said Brackenbury.

The Colonel consulted his watch.

“It is now hard on two,” he said. “We have an hour before us, and a
swift cab is at the door. Tell me if I may count upon your help.”

“During a long life,” replied Major O’Rooke, “I never took back my hand
from anything, nor so much as hedged a bet.”

Brackenbury signified his readiness in the most becoming terms; and
after they had drunk a glass or two of wine, the Colonel gave each of
them a loaded revolver, and the three mounted into the cab and drove
off for the address in question.

Rochester House was a magnificent residence on the banks of the canal.
The large extent of the garden isolated it in an unusual degree from
the annoyances of neighbourhood. It seemed the _parc aux cerfs_ of some
great nobleman or millionaire. As far as could be seen from the street,
there was not a glimmer of light in any of the numerous windows of the
mansion; and the place had a look of neglect, as though the master had
been long from home.

The cab was discharged, and the three gentlemen were not long in
discovering the small door, which was a sort of postern in a lane
between two garden walls. It still wanted ten or fifteen minutes of the
appointed time; the rain fell heavily, and the adventurers sheltered
themselves below some pendant ivy, and spoke in low tones of the
approaching trial.

Suddenly Geraldine raised his finger to command silence, and all three
bent their hearing to the utmost. Through the continuous noise of the
rain, the steps and voices of two men became audible from the other
side of the wall; and, as they drew nearer, Brackenbury, whose sense of
hearing was remarkably acute, could even distinguish some fragments of
their talk.

“Is the grave dug?” asked one.

“It is,” replied the other; “behind the laurel hedge. When the job is
done, we can cover it with a pile of stakes.”

The first speaker laughed, and the sound of his merriment was shocking
to the listeners on the other side.

“In an hour from now,” he said.

And by the sound of the steps it was obvious that the pair had
separated, and were proceeding in contrary directions.

Almost immediately after the postern door was cautiously opened, a
white face was protruded into the lane, and a hand was seen beckoning
to the watchers. In dead silence the three passed the door, which was
immediately locked behind them, and followed their guide through
several garden alleys to the kitchen entrance of the house. A single
candle burned in the great paved kitchen, which was destitute of the
customary furniture; and as the party proceeded to ascend from thence
by a flight of winding stairs, a prodigious noise of rats testified
still more plainly to the dilapidation of the house.

Their conductor preceded them, carrying the candle. He was a lean man,
much bent, but still agile; and he turned from time to time and
admonished silence and caution by his gestures. Colonel Geraldine
followed on his heels, the case of swords under one arm, and a pistol
ready in the other. Brackenbury’s heart beat thickly. He perceived that
they were still in time; but he judged from the alacrity of the old man
that the hour of action must be near at hand; and the circumstances of
this adventure were so obscure and menacing, the place seemed so well
chosen for the darkest acts, that an older man than Brackenbury might
have been pardoned a measure of emotion as he closed the procession up
the winding stair.

At the top the guide threw open a door and ushered the three officers
before him into a small apartment, lighted by a smoky lamp and the glow
of a modest fire. At the chimney corner sat a man in the early prime of
life, and of a stout but courtly and commanding appearance. His
attitude and expression were those of the most unmoved composure; he
was smoking a cheroot with much enjoyment and deliberation, and on a
table by his elbow stood a long glass of some effervescing beverage
which diffused an agreeable odour through the room.

“Welcome,” said he, extending his hand to Colonel Geraldine. “I knew I
might count on your exactitude.”

“On my devotion,” replied the Colonel, with a bow.

“Present me to your friends,” continued the first; and, when that
ceremony had been performed, “I wish, gentlemen,” he added, with the
most exquisite affability, “that I could offer you a more cheerful
programme; it is ungracious to inaugurate an acquaintance upon serious
affairs; but the compulsion of events is stronger than the obligations
of good-fellowship. I hope and believe you will be able to forgive me
this unpleasant evening; and for men of your stamp it will be enough to
know that you are conferring a considerable favour.”

“Your Highness,” said the Major, “must pardon my bluntness. I am unable
to hide what I know. For some time back I have suspected Major
Hammersmith, but Mr. Godall is unmistakable. To seek two men in London
unacquainted with Prince Florizel of Bohemia was to ask too much at
Fortune’s hands.”

“Prince Florizel!” cried Brackenbury in amazement.

And he gazed with the deepest interest on the features of the
celebrated personage before him.

“I shall not lament the loss of my incognito,” remarked the Prince,
“for it enables me to thank you with the more authority. You would have
done as much for Mr. Godall, I feel sure, as for the Prince of Bohemia;
but the latter can perhaps do more for you. The gain is mine,” he
added, with a courteous gesture.

And the next moment he was conversing with the two officers about the
Indian army and the native troops, a subject on which, as on all
others, he had a remarkable fund of information and the soundest views.

There was something so striking in this man’s attitude at a moment of
deadly peril that Brackenbury was overcome with respectful admiration;
nor was he less sensible to the charm of his conversation or the
surprising amenity of his address. Every gesture, every intonation, was
not only noble in itself, but seemed to ennoble the fortunate mortal
for whom it was intended; and Brackenbury confessed to himself with
enthusiasm that this was a sovereign for whom a brave man might
thankfully lay down his life.

Many minutes had thus passed, when the person who had introduced them
into the house, and who had sat ever since in a corner, and with his
watch in his hand, arose and whispered a word into the Prince’s ear.

“It is well, Dr. Noel,” replied Florizel, aloud; and then addressing
the others, “You will excuse me, gentlemen,” he added, “if I have to
leave you in the dark. The moment now approaches.”

Dr. Noel extinguished the lamp. A faint, grey light, premonitory of the
dawn, illuminated the window, but was not sufficient to illuminate the
room; and when the Prince rose to his feet, it was impossible to
distinguish his features or to make a guess at the nature of the
emotion which obviously affected him as he spoke. He moved towards the
door, and placed himself at one side of it in an attitude of the
wariest attention.

“You will have the kindness,” he said, “to maintain the strictest
silence, and to conceal yourselves in the densest of the shadow.”

The three officers and the physician hastened to obey, and for nearly
ten minutes the only sound in Rochester House was occasioned by the
excursions of the rats behind the woodwork. At the end of that period,
a loud creak of a hinge broke in with surprising distinctness on the
silence; and shortly after, the watchers could distinguish a slow and
cautious tread approaching up the kitchen stair. At every second step
the intruder seemed to pause and lend an ear, and during these
intervals, which seemed of an incalculable duration, a profound
disquiet possessed the spirit of the listeners. Dr. Noel, accustomed as
he was to dangerous emotions, suffered an almost pitiful physical
prostration; his breath whistled in his lungs, his teeth grated one
upon another, and his joints cracked aloud as he nervously shifted his
position.

At last a hand was laid upon the door, and the bolt shot back with a
slight report. There followed another pause, during which Brackenbury
could see the Prince draw himself together noiselessly as if for some
unusual exertion. Then the door opened, letting in a little more of the
light of the morning; and the figure of a man appeared upon the
threshold and stood motionless. He was tall, and carried a knife in his
hand. Even in the twilight they could see his upper teeth bare and
glistening, for his mouth was open like that of a hound about to leap.
The man had evidently been over the head in water but a minute or two
before; and even while he stood there the drops kept falling from his
wet clothes and pattered on the floor.

The next moment he crossed the threshold. There was a leap, a stifled
cry, an instantaneous struggle; and before Colonel Geraldine could
spring to his aid, the Prince held the man disarmed and helpless, by
the shoulders.

“Dr. Noel,” he said, “you will be so good as to re-light the lamp.”

And relinquishing the charge of his prisoner to Geraldine and
Brackenbury, he crossed the room and set his back against the
chimney-piece. As soon as the lamp had kindled, the party beheld an
unaccustomed sternness on the Prince’s features. It was no longer
Florizel, the careless gentleman; it was the Prince of Bohemia, justly
incensed and full of deadly purpose, who now raised his head and
addressed the captive President of the Suicide Club.

“President,” he said, “you have laid your last snare, and your own feet
are taken in it. The day is beginning; it is your last morning. You
have just swum the Regent’s Canal; it is your last bathe in this world.
Your old accomplice, Dr. Noel, so far from betraying me, has delivered
you into my hands for judgment. And the grave you had dug for me this
afternoon shall serve, in God’s almighty providence, to hide your own
just doom from the curiosity of mankind. Kneel and pray, sir, if you
have a mind that way; for your time is short, and God is weary of your
iniquities.”

The President made no answer either by word or sign; but continued to
hang his head and gaze sullenly on the floor, as though he were
conscious of the Prince’s prolonged and unsparing regard.

“Gentlemen,” continued Florizel, resuming the ordinary tone of his
conversation, “this is a fellow who has long eluded me, but whom,
thanks to Dr. Noel, I now have tightly by the heels. To tell the story
of his misdeeds would occupy more time than we can now afford; but if
the canal had contained nothing but the blood of his victims, I believe
the wretch would have been no drier than you see him. Even in an affair
of this sort I desire to preserve the forms of honour. But I make you
the judges, gentlemen—this is more an execution than a duel and to give
the rogue his choice of weapons would be to push too far a point of
etiquette. I cannot afford to lose my life in such a business,” he
continued, unlocking the case of swords; “and as a pistol-bullet
travels so often on the wings of chance, and skill and courage may fall
by the most trembling marksman, I have decided, and I feel sure you
will approve my determination, to put this question to the touch of
swords.”

When Brackenbury and Major O’Rooke, to whom these remarks were
particularly addressed, had each intimated his approval, “Quick, sir,”
added Prince Florizel to the President, “choose a blade and do not keep
me waiting; I have an impatience to be done with you for ever.”

For the first time since he was captured and disarmed the President
raised his head, and it was plain that he began instantly to pluck up
courage.

“Is it to be stand up?” he asked eagerly, “and between you and me?”

“I mean so far to honour you,” replied the Prince.

“Oh, come!” cried the President. “With a fair field, who knows how
things may happen? I must add that I consider it handsome behaviour on
your Highness’s part; and if the worst comes to the worst I shall die
by one of the most gallant gentlemen in Europe.”

And the President, liberated by those who had detained him, stepped up
to the table and began, with minute attention, to select a sword. He
was highly elated, and seemed to feel no doubt that he should issue
victorious from the contest. The spectators grew alarmed in the face of
so entire a confidence, and adjured Prince Florizel to reconsider his
intention.

“It is but a farce,” he answered; “and I think I can promise you,
gentlemen, that it will not be long a-playing.”

“Your Highness will be careful not to over-reach,” said Colonel
Geraldine.

“Geraldine,” returned the Prince, “did you ever know me fail in a debt
of honour? I owe you this man’s death, and you shall have it.”

The President at last satisfied himself with one of the rapiers, and
signified his readiness by a gesture that was not devoid of a rude
nobility. The nearness of peril, and the sense of courage, even to this
obnoxious villain, lent an air of manhood and a certain grace.

The Prince helped himself at random to a sword.

“Colonel Geraldine and Doctor Noel,” he said, “will have the goodness
to await me in this room. I wish no personal friend of mine to be
involved in this transaction. Major O’Rooke, you are a man of some
years and a settled reputation—let me recommend the President to your
good graces. Lieutenant Rich will be so good as lend me his attentions:
a young man cannot have too much experience in such affairs.”

“Your Highness,” replied Brackenbury, “it is an honour I shall prize
extremely.”

“It is well,” returned Prince Florizel; “I shall hope to stand your
friend in more important circumstances.”

And so saying he led the way out of the apartment and down the kitchen
stairs.

The two men who were thus left alone threw open the window and leaned
out, straining every sense to catch an indication of the tragical
events that were about to follow. The rain was now over; day had almost
come, and the birds were piping in the shrubbery and on the forest
trees of the garden. The Prince and his companions were visible for a
moment as they followed an alley between two flowering thickets; but at
the first corner a clump of foliage intervened, and they were again
concealed from view. This was all that the Colonel and the Physician
had an opportunity to see, and the garden was so vast, and the place of
combat evidently so remote from the house, that not even the noise of
sword-play reached their ears.

“He has taken him towards the grave,” said Dr. Noel, with a shudder.

“God,” cried the Colonel, “God defend the right!”

And they awaited the event in silence, the Doctor shaking with fear,
the Colonel in an agony of sweat. Many minutes must have elapsed, the
day was sensibly broader, and the birds were singing more heartily in
the garden before a sound of returning footsteps recalled their glances
towards the door. It was the Prince and the two Indian officers who
entered. God had defended the right.

“I am ashamed of my emotion,” said Prince Florizel; “I feel it is a
weakness unworthy of my station, but the continued existence of that
hound of hell had begun to prey upon me like a disease, and his death
has more refreshed me than a night of slumber. Look, Geraldine,” he
continued, throwing his sword upon the floor, “there is the blood of
the man who killed your brother. It should be a welcome sight. And
yet,” he added, “see how strangely we men are made! my revenge is not
yet five minutes old, and already I am beginning to ask myself if even
revenge be attainable on this precarious stage of life. The ill he did,
who can undo it? The career in which he amassed a huge fortune (for the
house itself in which we stand belonged to him)—that career is now a
part of the destiny of mankind for ever; and I might weary myself
making thrusts in carte until the crack of judgment, and Geraldine’s
brother would be none the less dead, and a thousand other innocent
persons would be none the less dishonoured and debauched! The existence
of a man is so small a thing to take, so mighty a thing to employ!
Alas!” he cried, “is there anything in life so disenchanting as
attainment?”

“God’s justice has been done,” replied the Doctor. “So much I behold.
The lesson, your Highness, has been a cruel one for me; and I await my
own turn with deadly apprehension.”

“What was I saying?” cried the Prince. “I have punished, and here is
the man beside us who can help me to undo. Ah, Dr. Noel! you and I have
before us many a day of hard and honourable toil; and perhaps, before
we have none, you may have more than redeemed your early errors.”

“And in the meantime,” said the Doctor, “let me go and bury my oldest
friend.”


(_And this_, observes the erudite Arabian, _is the fortunate conclusion
of the tale_. _The Prince_, _it is superfluous to mention_, _forgot
none of those who served him in this great exploit_; _and to this day
his authority and influence help them forward in their public career_,
_while his condescending friendship adds a charm to their private
life_. _To collect_, continues my author, _all the strange events in
which this Prince has played the part of Providence were to fill the
habitable globe with books_. _But the stories which relate to the
fortunes of_ The Rajah’s Diamond _are of too entertaining a
description_, says he, _to be omitted_. _Following prudently in the
footsteps of this Oriental_, _we shall now begin the series to which he
refers with the_ Story of the Bandbox.)




THE RAJAH’S DIAMOND




STORY OF THE BANDBOX


Up to the age of sixteen, at a private school and afterwards at one of
those great institutions for which England is justly famous, Mr. Harry
Hartley had received the ordinary education of a gentleman. At that
period, he manifested a remarkable distaste for study; and his only
surviving parent being both weak and ignorant, he was permitted
thenceforward to spend his time in the attainment of petty and purely
elegant accomplishments. Two years later, he was left an orphan and
almost a beggar. For all active and industrious pursuits, Harry was
unfitted alike by nature and training. He could sing romantic ditties,
and accompany himself with discretion on the piano; he was a graceful
although a timid cavalier; he had a pronounced taste for chess; and
nature had sent him into the world with one of the most engaging
exteriors that can well be fancied. Blond and pink, with dove’s eyes
and a gentle smile, he had an air of agreeable tenderness and
melancholy, and the most submissive and caressing manners. But when all
is said, he was not the man to lead armaments of war, or direct the
councils of a State.

A fortunate chance and some influence obtained for Harry, at the time
of his bereavement, the position of private secretary to Major-General
Sir Thomas Vandeleur, C.B. Sir Thomas was a man of sixty, loud-spoken,
boisterous, and domineering. For some reason, some service the nature
of which had been often whispered and repeatedly denied, the Rajah of
Kashgar had presented this officer with the sixth known diamond of the
world. The gift transformed General Vandeleur from a poor into a
wealthy man, from an obscure and unpopular soldier into one of the
lions of London society; the possessor of the Rajah’s Diamond was
welcome in the most exclusive circles; and he had found a lady, young,
beautiful, and well-born, who was willing to call the diamond hers even
at the price of marriage with Sir Thomas Vandeleur. It was commonly
said at the time that, as like draws to like, one jewel had attracted
another; certainly Lady Vandeleur was not only a gem of the finest
water in her own person, but she showed herself to the world in a very
costly setting; and she was considered by many respectable authorities,
as one among the three or four best dressed women in England.

Harry’s duty as secretary was not particularly onerous; but he had a
dislike for all prolonged work; it gave him pain to ink his fingers;
and the charms of Lady Vandeleur and her toilettes drew him often from
the library to the boudoir. He had the prettiest ways among women,
could talk fashions with enjoyment, and was never more happy than when
criticising a shade of ribbon, or running on an errand to the
milliner’s. In short, Sir Thomas’s correspondence fell into pitiful
arrears, and my Lady had another lady’s maid.

At last the General, who was one of the least patient of military
commanders, arose from his place in a violent access of passion, and
indicated to his secretary that he had no further need for his
services, with one of those explanatory gestures which are most rarely
employed between gentlemen. The door being unfortunately open, Mr.
Hartley fell downstairs head foremost.

He arose somewhat hurt and very deeply aggrieved. The life in the
General’s house precisely suited him; he moved, on a more or less
doubtful footing, in very genteel company, he did little, he ate of the
best, and he had a lukewarm satisfaction in the presence of Lady
Vandeleur, which, in his own heart, he dubbed by a more emphatic name.

Immediately after he had been outraged by the military foot, he hurried
to the boudoir and recounted his sorrows.

“You know very well, my dear Harry,” replied Lady Vandeleur, for she
called him by name like a child or a domestic servant, “that you never
by any chance do what the General tells you. No more do I, you may say.
But that is different. A woman can earn her pardon for a good year of
disobedience by a single adroit submission; and, besides, no one is
married to his private secretary. I shall be sorry to lose you; but
since you cannot stay longer in a house where you have been insulted, I
shall wish you good-bye, and I promise you to make the General smart
for his behaviour.”

Harry’s countenance fell; tears came into his eyes, and he gazed on
Lady Vandeleur with a tender reproach.

“My Lady,” said he, “what is an insult? I should think little indeed of
any one who could not forgive them by the score. But to leave one’s
friends; to tear up the bonds of affection—”

He was unable to continue, for his emotion choked him, and he began to
weep.

Lady Vandeleur looked at him with a curious expression. “This little
fool,” she thought, “imagines himself to be in love with me. Why should
he not become my servant instead of the General’s? He is good-natured,
obliging, and understands dress; and besides it will keep him out of
mischief. He is positively too pretty to be unattached.” That night she
talked over the General, who was already somewhat ashamed of his
vivacity; and Harry was transferred to the feminine department, where
his life was little short of heavenly. He was always dressed with
uncommon nicety, wore delicate flowers in his button-hole, and could
entertain a visitor with tact and pleasantry. He took a pride in
servility to a beautiful woman; received Lady Vandeleur’s commands as
so many marks of favour; and was pleased to exhibit himself before
other men, who derided and despised him, in his character of male
lady’s-maid and man milliner. Nor could he think enough of his
existence from a moral point of view. Wickedness seemed to him an
essentially male attribute, and to pass one’s days with a delicate
woman, and principally occupied about trimmings, was to inhabit an
enchanted isle among the storms of life.

One fine morning he came into the drawing-room and began to arrange
some music on the top of the piano. Lady Vandeleur, at the other end of
the apartment, was speaking somewhat eagerly with her brother, Charlie
Pendragon, an elderly young man, much broken with dissipation, and very
lame of one foot. The private secretary, to whose entrance they paid no
regard, could not avoid overhearing a part of their conversation.

“To-day or never,” said the lady. “Once and for all, it shall be done
to-day.”

“To-day, if it must be,” replied the brother, with a sigh. “But it is a
false step, a ruinous step, Clara; and we shall live to repent it
dismally.”

Lady Vandeleur looked her brother steadily and somewhat strangely in
the face.

“You forget,” she said; “the man must die at last.”

“Upon my word, Clara,” said Pendragon, “I believe you are the most
heartless rascal in England.”

“You men,” she returned, “are so coarsely built, that you can never
appreciate a shade of meaning. You are yourselves rapacious, violent,
immodest, careless of distinction; and yet the least thought for the
future shocks you in a woman. I have no patience with such stuff. You
would despise in a common banker the imbecility that you expect to find
in us.”

“You are very likely right,” replied her brother; “you were always
cleverer than I. And, anyway, you know my motto: The family before
all.”

“Yes, Charlie,” she returned, taking his hand in hers, “I know your
motto better than you know it yourself. ‘And Clara before the family!’
Is not that the second part of it? Indeed, you are the best of
brothers, and I love you dearly.”

Mr. Pendragon got up, looking a little confused by these family
endearments.

“I had better not be seen,” said he. “I understand my part to a
miracle, and I’ll keep an eye on the Tame Cat.”

“Do,” she replied. “He is an abject creature, and might ruin all.”

She kissed the tips of her fingers to him daintily; and the brother
withdrew by the boudoir and the back stair.

“Harry,” said Lady Vandeleur, turning towards the secretary as soon as
they were alone, “I have a commission for you this morning. But you
shall take a cab; I cannot have my secretary freckled.”

She spoke the last words with emphasis and a look of half-motherly
pride that caused great contentment to poor Harry; and he professed
himself charmed to find an opportunity of serving her.

“It is another of our great secrets,” she went on archly, “and no one
must know of it but my secretary and me. Sir Thomas would make the
saddest disturbance; and if you only knew how weary I am of these
scenes! Oh, Harry, Harry, can you explain to me what makes you men so
violent and unjust? But, indeed, I know you cannot; you are the only
man in the world who knows nothing of these shameful passions; you are
so good, Harry, and so kind; you, at least, can be a woman’s friend;
and, do you know? I think you make the others more ugly by comparison.”

“It is you,” said Harry gallantly, “who are so kind to me. You treat me
like—”

“Like a mother,” interposed Lady Vandeleur; “I try to be a mother to
you. Or, at least,” she corrected herself with a smile, “almost a
mother. I am afraid I am too young to be your mother really. Let us say
a friend—a dear friend.”

She paused long enough to let her words take effect in Harry’s
sentimental quarters, but not long enough to allow him a reply.

“But all this is beside our purpose,” she resumed. “You will find a
bandbox in the left-hand side of the oak wardrobe; it is underneath the
pink slip that I wore on Wednesday with my Mechlin. You will take it
immediately to this address,” and she gave him a paper, “but do not, on
any account, let it out of your hands until you have received a receipt
written by myself. Do you understand? Answer, if you please—answer!
This is extremely important, and I must ask you to pay some attention.”

Harry pacified her by repeating her instructions perfectly; and she was
just going to tell him more when General Vandeleur flung into the
apartment, scarlet with anger, and holding a long and elaborate
milliner’s bill in his hand.

“Will you look at this, madam?” cried he. “Will you have the goodness
to look at this document? I know well enough you married me for my
money, and I hope I can make as great allowances as any other man in
the service; but, as sure as God made me, I mean to put a period to
this disreputable prodigality.”

“Mr. Hartley,” said Lady Vandeleur, “I think you understand what you
have to do. May I ask you to see to it at once?”

“Stop,” said the General, addressing Harry, “one word before you go.”
And then, turning again to Lady Vandeleur, “What is this precious
fellow’s errand?” he demanded. “I trust him no further than I do
yourself, let me tell you. If he had as much as the rudiments of
honesty, he would scorn to stay in this house; and what he does for his
wages is a mystery to all the world. What is his errand, madam? and why
are you hurrying him away?”

“I supposed you had something to say to me in private,” replied the
lady.

“You spoke about an errand,” insisted the General. “Do not attempt to
deceive me in my present state of temper. You certainly spoke about an
errand.”

“If you insist on making your servants privy to our humiliating
dissensions,” replied Lady Vandeleur, “perhaps I had better ask Mr.
Hartley to sit down. No?” she continued; “then you may go, Mr. Hartley.
I trust you may remember all that you have heard in this room; it may
be useful to you.”

Harry at once made his escape from the drawing-room; and as he ran
upstairs he could hear the General’s voice upraised in declamation, and
the thin tones of Lady Vandeleur planting icy repartees at every
opening. How cordially he admired the wife! How skilfully she could
evade an awkward question! with what secure effrontery she repeated her
instructions under the very guns of the enemy! and on the other hand,
how he detested the husband!

There had been nothing unfamiliar in the morning’s events, for he was
continually in the habit of serving Lady Vandeleur on secret missions,
principally connected with millinery. There was a skeleton in the
house, as he well knew. The bottomless extravagance and the unknown
liabilities of the wife had long since swallowed her own fortune, and
threatened day by day to engulph that of the husband. Once or twice in
every year exposure and ruin seemed imminent, and Harry kept trotting
round to all sorts of furnishers’ shops, telling small fibs, and paying
small advances on the gross amount, until another term was tided over,
and the lady and her faithful secretary breathed again. For Harry, in a
double capacity, was heart and soul upon that side of the war: not only
did he adore Lady Vandeleur and fear and dislike her husband, but he
naturally sympathised with the love of finery, and his own single
extravagance was at the tailor’s.

He found the bandbox where it had been described, arranged his toilette
with care, and left the house. The sun shone brightly; the distance he
had to travel was considerable, and he remembered with dismay that the
General’s sudden irruption had prevented Lady Vandeleur from giving him
money for a cab. On this sultry day there was every chance that his
complexion would suffer severely; and to walk through so much of London
with a bandbox on his arm was a humiliation almost insupportable to a
youth of his character. He paused, and took counsel with himself. The
Vandeleurs lived in Eaton Place; his destination was near Notting Hill;
plainly, he might cross the Park by keeping well in the open and
avoiding populous alleys; and he thanked his stars when he reflected
that it was still comparatively early in the day.

Anxious to be rid of his incubus, he walked somewhat faster than his
ordinary, and he was already some way through Kensington Gardens when,
in a solitary spot among trees, he found himself confronted by the
General.

“I beg your pardon, Sir Thomas,” observed Harry, politely falling on
one side; for the other stood directly in his path.

“Where are you going, sir?” asked the General.

“I am taking a little walk among the trees,” replied the lad.

The General struck the bandbox with his cane.

“With that thing?” he cried; “you lie, sir, and you know you lie!”

“Indeed, Sir Thomas,” returned Harry, “I am not accustomed to be
questioned in so high a key.”

“You do not understand your position,” said the General. “You are my
servant, and a servant of whom I have conceived the most serious
suspicions. How do I know but that your box is full of teaspoons?”

“It contains a silk hat belonging to a friend,” said Harry.

“Very well,” replied General Vandeleur. “Then I want to see your
friend’s silk hat. I have,” he added grimly, “a singular curiosity for
hats; and I believe you know me to be somewhat positive.”

“I beg your pardon, Sir Thomas, I am exceedingly grieved,” Harry
apologised; “but indeed this is a private affair.”

The General caught him roughly by the shoulder with one hand, while he
raised his cane in the most menacing manner with the other. Harry gave
himself up for lost; but at the same moment Heaven vouchsafed him an
unexpected defender in the person of Charlie Pendragon, who now strode
forward from behind the trees.

“Come, come, General, hold your hand,” said he, “this is neither
courteous nor manly.”

“Aha!” cried the General, wheeling round upon his new antagonist, “Mr.
Pendragon! And do you suppose, Mr. Pendragon, that because I have had
the misfortune to marry your sister, I shall suffer myself to be dogged
and thwarted by a discredited and bankrupt libertine like you? My
acquaintance with Lady Vandeleur, sir, has taken away all my appetite
for the other members of her family.”

“And do you fancy, General Vandeleur,” retorted Charlie, “that because
my sister has had the misfortune to marry you, she there and then
forfeited her rights and privileges as a lady? I own, sir, that by that
action she did as much as anybody could to derogate from her position;
but to me she is still a Pendragon. I make it my business to protect
her from ungentlemanly outrage, and if you were ten times her husband I
would not permit her liberty to be restrained, nor her private
messengers to be violently arrested.”

“How is that, Mr. Hartley?” interrogated the General. “Mr. Pendragon is
of my opinion, it appears. He too suspects that Lady Vandeleur has
something to do with your friend’s silk hat.”

Charlie saw that he had committed an unpardonable blunder, which he
hastened to repair.

“How, sir?” he cried; “I suspect, do you say? I suspect nothing. Only
where I find strength abused and a man brutalising his inferiors, I
take the liberty to interfere.”

As he said these words he made a sign to Harry, which the latter was
too dull or too much troubled to understand.

“In what way am I to construe your attitude, sir?” demanded Vandeleur.

“Why, sir, as you please,” returned Pendragon.

The General once more raised his cane, and made a cut for Charlie’s
head; but the latter, lame foot and all, evaded the blow with his
umbrella, ran in, and immediately closed with his formidable adversary.

“Run, Harry, run!” he cried; “run, you dolt!”

Harry stood petrified for a moment, watching the two men sway together
in this fierce embrace; then he turned and took to his heels. When he
cast a glance over his shoulder he saw the General prostrate under
Charlie’s knee, but still making desperate efforts to reverse the
situation; and the Gardens seemed to have filled with people, who were
running from all directions towards the scene of fight. This spectacle
lent the secretary wings; and he did not relax his pace until he had
gained the Bayswater road, and plunged at random into an unfrequented
by-street.

To see two gentlemen of his acquaintance thus brutally mauling each
other was deeply shocking to Harry. He desired to forget the sight; he
desired, above all, to put as great a distance as possible between
himself and General Vandeleur; and in his eagerness for this he forgot
everything about his destination, and hurried before him headlong and
trembling. When he remembered that Lady Vandeleur was the wife of one
and the sister of the other of these gladiators, his heart was touched
with sympathy for a woman so distressingly misplaced in life. Even his
own situation in the General’s household looked hardly so pleasing as
usual in the light of these violent transactions.

He had walked some little distance, busied with these meditations,
before a slight collision with another passenger reminded him of the
bandbox on his arm.

“Heavens!” cried he, “where was my head? and whither have I wandered?”

Thereupon he consulted the envelope which Lady Vandeleur had given him.
The address was there, but without a name. Harry was simply directed to
ask for “the gentleman who expected a parcel from Lady Vandeleur,” and
if he were not at home to await his return. The gentleman, added the
note, should present a receipt in the handwriting of the lady herself.
All this seemed mightily mysterious, and Harry was above all astonished
at the omission of the name and the formality of the receipt. He had
thought little of this last when he heard it dropped in conversation;
but reading it in cold blood, and taking it in connection with the
other strange particulars, he became convinced that he was engaged in
perilous affairs. For half a moment he had a doubt of Lady Vandeleur
herself; for he found these obscure proceedings somewhat unworthy of so
high a lady, and became more critical when her secrets were preserved
against himself. But her empire over his spirit was too complete, he
dismissed his suspicions, and blamed himself roundly for having so much
as entertained them.

In one thing, however, his duty and interest, his generosity and his
terrors, coincided—to get rid of the bandbox with the greatest possible
despatch.

He accosted the first policeman and courteously inquired his way. It
turned out that he was already not far from his destination, and a walk
of a few minutes brought him to a small house in a lane, freshly
painted, and kept with the most scrupulous attention. The knocker and
bell-pull were highly polished; flowering pot-herbs garnished the sills
of the different windows; and curtains of some rich material concealed
the interior from the eyes of curious passengers. The place had an air
of repose and secrecy; and Harry was so far caught with this spirit
that he knocked with more than usual discretion, and was more than
usually careful to remove all impurity from his boots.

A servant-maid of some personal attractions immediately opened the
door, and seemed to regard the secretary with no unkind eyes.

“This is the parcel from Lady Vandeleur,” said Harry.

“I know,” replied the maid, with a nod. “But the gentleman is from
home. Will you leave it with me?”

“I cannot,” answered Harry. “I am directed not to part with it but upon
a certain condition, and I must ask you, I am afraid, to let me wait.”

“Well,” said she, “I suppose I may let you wait. I am lonely enough, I
can tell you, and you do not look as though you would eat a girl. But
be sure and do not ask the gentleman’s name, for that I am not to tell
you.”

“Do you say so?” cried Harry. “Why, how strange! But indeed for some
time back I walk among surprises. One question I think I may surely ask
without indiscretion: Is he the master of this house?”

“He is a lodger, and not eight days old at that,” returned the maid.
“And now a question for a question: Do you know lady Vandeleur?”

“I am her private secretary,” replied Harry with a glow of modest
pride.

“She is pretty, is she not?” pursued the servant.

“Oh, beautiful!” cried Harry; “wonderfully lovely, and not less good
and kind!”

“You look kind enough yourself,” she retorted; “and I wager you are
worth a dozen Lady Vandeleurs.”

Harry was properly scandalised.

“I!” he cried. “I am only a secretary!”

“Do you mean that for me?” said the girl. “Because I am only a
housemaid, if you please.” And then, relenting at the sight of Harry’s
obvious confusion, “I know you mean nothing of the sort,” she added;
“and I like your looks; but I think nothing of your Lady Vandeleur. Oh,
these mistresses!” she cried. “To send out a real gentleman like
you—with a bandbox—in broad day!”

During this talk they had remained in their original positions—she on
the doorstep, he on the side-walk, bareheaded for the sake of coolness,
and with the bandbox on his arm. But upon this last speech Harry, who
was unable to support such point-blank compliments to his appearance,
nor the encouraging look with which they were accompanied, began to
change his attitude, and glance from left to right in perturbation. In
so doing he turned his face towards the lower end of the lane, and
there, to his indescribable dismay, his eyes encountered those of
General Vandeleur. The General, in a prodigious fluster of heat, hurry,
and indignation, had been scouring the streets in chase of his
brother-in-law; but so soon as he caught a glimpse of the delinquent
secretary, his purpose changed, his anger flowed into a new channel,
and he turned on his heel and came tearing up the lane with truculent
gestures and vociferations.

Harry made but one bolt of it into the house, driving the maid before
him; and the door was slammed in his pursuer’s countenance.

“Is there a bar? Will it lock?” asked Harry, while a salvo on the
knocker made the house echo from wall to wall.

“Why, what is wrong with you?” asked the maid. “Is it this old
gentleman?”

“If he gets hold of me,” whispered Harry, “I am as good as dead. He has
been pursuing me all day, carries a sword-stick, and is an Indian
military officer.”

“These are fine manners,” cried the maid. “And what, if you please, may
be his name?”

“It is the General, my master,” answered Harry. “He is after this
bandbox.”

“Did not I tell you?” cried the maid in triumph. “I told you I thought
worse than nothing of your Lady Vandeleur; and if you had an eye in
your head you might see what she is for yourself. An ungrateful minx, I
will be bound for that!”

The General renewed his attack upon the knocker, and his passion
growing with delay, began to kick and beat upon the panels of the door.

“It is lucky,” observed the girl, “that I am alone in the house; your
General may hammer until he is weary, and there is none to open for
him. Follow me!”

So saying she led Harry into the kitchen, where she made him sit down,
and stood by him herself in an affectionate attitude, with a hand upon
his shoulder. The din at the door, so far from abating, continued to
increase in volume, and at each blow the unhappy secretary was shaken
to the heart.

“What is your name?” asked the girl.

“Harry Hartley,” he replied.

“Mine,” she went on, “is Prudence. Do you like it?”

“Very much,” said Harry. “But hear for a moment how the General beats
upon the door. He will certainly break it in, and then, in heaven’s
name, what have I to look for but death?”

“You put yourself very much about with no occasion,” answered Prudence.
“Let your General knock, he will do no more than blister his hands. Do
you think I would keep you here if I were not sure to save you? Oh, no,
I am a good friend to those that please me! and we have a back door
upon another lane. But,” she added, checking him, for he had got upon
his feet immediately on this welcome news, “but I will not show where
it is unless you kiss me. Will you, Harry?”

“That I will,” he cried, remembering his gallantry, “not for your back
door, but because you are good and pretty.”

And he administered two or three cordial salutes, which were returned
to him in kind.

Then Prudence led him to the back gate, and put her hand upon the key.

“Will you come and see me?” she asked.

“I will indeed,” said Harry. “Do not I owe you my life?”

“And now,” she added, opening the door, “run as hard as you can, for I
shall let in the General.”

Harry scarcely required this advice; fear had him by the forelock; and
he addressed himself diligently to flight. A few steps, and he believed
he would escape from his trials, and return to Lady Vandeleur in honour
and safety. But these few steps had not been taken before he heard a
man’s voice hailing him by name with many execrations, and, looking
over his shoulder, he beheld Charlie Pendragon waving him with both
arms to return. The shock of this new incident was so sudden and
profound, and Harry was already worked into so high a state of nervous
tension, that he could think of nothing better than to accelerate his
pace, and continue running. He should certainly have remembered the
scene in Kensington Gardens; he should certainly have concluded that,
where the General was his enemy, Charlie Pendragon could be no other
than a friend. But such was the fever and perturbation of his mind that
he was struck by none of these considerations, and only continued to
run the faster up the lane.

Charlie, by the sound of his voice and the vile terms that he hurled
after the secretary, was obviously beside himself with rage. He, too,
ran his very best; but, try as he might, the physical advantages were
not upon his side, and his outcries and the fall of his lame foot on
the macadam began to fall farther and farther into the wake.

Harry’s hopes began once more to arise. The lane was both steep and
narrow, but it was exceedingly solitary, bordered on either hand by
garden walls, overhung with foliage; and, for as far as the fugitive
could see in front of him, there was neither a creature moving nor an
open door. Providence, weary of persecution, was now offering him an
open field for his escape.

Alas! as he came abreast of a garden door under a tuft of chestnuts, it
was suddenly drawn back, and he could see inside, upon a garden path,
the figure of a butcher’s boy with his tray upon his arm. He had hardly
recognised the fact before he was some steps beyond upon the other
side. But the fellow had had time to observe him; he was evidently much
surprised to see a gentleman go by at so unusual a pace; and he came
out into the lane and began to call after Harry with shouts of ironical
encouragement.

His appearance gave a new idea to Charlie Pendragon, who, although he
was now sadly out of breath, once more upraised his voice.

“Stop, thief!” he cried.

And immediately the butcher’s boy had taken up the cry and joined in
the pursuit.

This was a bitter moment for the hunted secretary. It is true that his
terror enabled him once more to improve his pace, and gain with every
step on his pursuers; but he was well aware that he was near the end of
his resources, and should he meet any one coming the other way, his
predicament in the narrow lane would be desperate indeed.

“I must find a place of concealment,” he thought, “and that within the
next few seconds, or all is over with me in this world.”

Scarcely had the thought crossed his mind than the lane took a sudden
turning; and he found himself hidden from his enemies. There are
circumstances in which even the least energetic of mankind learn to
behave with vigour and decision; and the most cautious forget their
prudence and embrace foolhardy resolutions. This was one of those
occasions for Harry Hartley; and those who knew him best would have
been the most astonished at the lad’s audacity. He stopped dead, flung
the bandbox over a garden wall, and leaping upward with incredible
agility and seizing the copestone with his hands, he tumbled headlong
after it into the garden.

He came to himself a moment afterwards, seated in a border of small
rosebushes. His hands and knees were cut and bleeding, for the wall had
been protected against such an escalade by a liberal provision of old
bottles; and he was conscious of a general dislocation and a painful
swimming in the head. Facing him across the garden, which was in
admirable order, and set with flowers of the most delicious perfume, he
beheld the back of a house. It was of considerable extent, and plainly
habitable; but, in odd contrast to the grounds, it was crazy, ill-kept,
and of a mean appearance. On all other sides the circuit of the garden
wall appeared unbroken.

He took in these features of the scene with mechanical glances, but his
mind was still unable to piece together or draw a rational conclusion
from what he saw. And when he heard footsteps advancing on the gravel,
although he turned his eyes in that direction, it was with no thought
either for defence or flight.

The new-comer was a large, coarse, and very sordid personage, in
gardening clothes, and with a watering-pot in his left hand. One less
confused would have been affected with some alarm at the sight of this
man’s huge proportions and black and lowering eyes. But Harry was too
gravely shaken by his fall to be so much as terrified; and if he was
unable to divert his glances from the gardener, he remained absolutely
passive, and suffered him to draw near, to take him by the shoulder,
and to plant him roughly on his feet, without a motion of resistance.

For a moment the two stared into each other’s eyes, Harry fascinated,
the man filled with wrath and a cruel, sneering humour.

“Who are you?” he demanded at last. “Who are you to come flying over my
wall and break my _Gloire de Dijons_! What is your name?” he added,
shaking him; “and what may be your business here?”

Harry could not as much as proffer a word in explanation.

But just at that moment Pendragon and the butcher’s boy went clumping
past, and the sound of their feet and their hoarse cries echoed loudly
in the narrow lane. The gardener had received his answer; and he looked
down into Harry’s face with an obnoxious smile.

“A thief!” he said. “Upon my word, and a very good thing you must make
of it; for I see you dressed like a gentleman from top to toe. Are you
not ashamed to go about the world in such a trim, with honest folk, I
dare say, glad to buy your cast-off finery second hand? Speak up, you
dog,” the man went on; “you can understand English, I suppose; and I
mean to have a bit of talk with you before I march you to the station.”

“Indeed, sir,” said Harry, “this is all a dreadful misconception; and
if you will go with me to Sir Thomas Vandeleur’s in Eaton Place, I can
promise that all will be made plain. The most upright person, as I now
perceive, can be led into suspicious positions.”

“My little man,” replied the gardener, “I will go with you no farther
than the station-house in the next street. The inspector, no doubt,
will be glad to take a stroll with you as far as Eaton Place, and have
a bit of afternoon tea with your great acquaintances. Or would you
prefer to go direct to the Home Secretary? Sir Thomas Vandeleur,
indeed! Perhaps you think I don’t know a gentleman when I see one, from
a common run-the-hedge like you? Clothes or no clothes, I can read you
like a book. Here is a shirt that maybe cost as much as my Sunday hat;
and that coat, I take it, has never seen the inside of Rag-fair, and
then your boots—”

The man, whose eyes had fallen upon the ground, stopped short in his
insulting commentary, and remained for a moment looking intently upon
something at his feet. When he spoke his voice was strangely altered.

“What, in God’s name,” said he, “is all this?”

Harry, following the direction of the man’s eyes, beheld a spectacle
that struck him dumb with terror and amazement. In his fall he had
descended vertically upon the bandbox and burst it open from end to
end; thence a great treasure of diamonds had poured forth, and now lay
abroad, part trodden in the soil, part scattered on the surface in
regal and glittering profusion. There was a magnificent coronet which
he had often admired on Lady Vandeleur; there were rings and brooches,
ear-drops and bracelets, and even unset brilliants rolling here and
there among the rosebushes like drops of morning dew. A princely
fortune lay between the two men upon the ground—a fortune in the most
inviting, solid, and durable form, capable of being carried in an
apron, beautiful in itself, and scattering the sunlight in a million
rainbow flashes.

“Good God!” said Harry, “I am lost!”

His mind raced backwards into the past with the incalculable velocity
of thought, and he began to comprehend his day’s adventures, to
conceive them as a whole, and to recognise the sad imbroglio in which
his own character and fortunes had become involved. He looked round him
as if for help, but he was alone in the garden, with his scattered
diamonds and his redoubtable interlocutor; and when he gave ear, there
was no sound but the rustle of the leaves and the hurried pulsation of
his heart. It was little wonder if the young man felt himself deserted
by his spirits, and with a broken voice repeated his last
ejaculation—“I am lost!”

The gardener peered in all directions with an air of guilt; but there
was no face at any of the windows, and he seemed to breathe again.

“Pick up a heart,” he said, “you fool! The worst of it is done. Why
could you not say at first there was enough for two? Two?” he repeated,
“aye, and for two hundred! But come away from here, where we may be
observed; and, for the love of wisdom, straighten out your hat and
brush your clothes. You could not travel two steps the figure of fun
you look just now.”

While Harry mechanically adopted these suggestions, the gardener,
getting upon his knees, hastily drew together the scattered jewels and
returned them to the bandbox. The touch of these costly crystals sent a
shiver of emotion through the man’s stalwart frame; his face was
transfigured, and his eyes shone with concupiscence; indeed it seemed
as if he luxuriously prolonged his occupation, and dallied with every
diamond that he handled. At last, however, it was done; and, concealing
the bandbox in his smock, the gardener beckoned to Harry and preceded
him in the direction of the house.

Near the door they were met by a young man evidently in holy orders,
dark and strikingly handsome, with a look of mingled weakness and
resolution, and very neatly attired after the manner of his caste. The
gardener was plainly annoyed by this encounter; but he put as good a
face upon it as he could, and accosted the clergyman with an obsequious
and smiling air.

“Here is a fine afternoon, Mr. Rolles,” said he: “a fine afternoon, as
sure as God made it! And here is a young friend of mine who had a fancy
to look at my roses. I took the liberty to bring him in, for I thought
none of the lodgers would object.”

“Speaking for myself,” replied the Reverend Mr. Rolles, “I do not; nor
do I fancy any of the rest of us would be more difficult upon so small
a matter. The garden is your own, Mr. Raeburn; we must none of us
forget that; and because you give us liberty to walk there we should be
indeed ungracious if we so far presumed upon your politeness as to
interfere with the convenience of your friends. But, on second
thoughts,” he added, “I believe that this gentleman and I have met
before. Mr. Hartley, I think. I regret to observe that you have had a
fall.”

And he offered his hand.

A sort of maiden dignity and a desire to delay as long as possible the
necessity for explanation moved Harry to refuse this chance of help,
and to deny his own identity. He chose the tender mercies of the
gardener, who was at least unknown to him, rather than the curiosity
and perhaps the doubts of an acquaintance.

“I fear there is some mistake,” said he. “My name is Thomlinson and I
am a friend of Mr. Raeburn’s.”

“Indeed?” said Mr. Rolles. “The likeness is amazing.”

Mr. Raeburn, who had been upon thorns throughout this colloquy, now
felt it high time to bring it to a period.

“I wish you a pleasant saunter, sir,” said he.

And with that he dragged Harry after him into the house, and then into
a chamber on the garden. His first care was to draw down the blind, for
Mr. Rolles still remained where they had left him, in an attitude of
perplexity and thought. Then he emptied the broken bandbox on the
table, and stood before the treasure, thus fully displayed, with an
expression of rapturous greed, and rubbing his hands upon his thighs.
For Harry, the sight of the man’s face under the influence of this base
emotion, added another pang to those he was already suffering. It
seemed incredible that, from his life of pure and delicate trifling, he
should be plunged in a breath among sordid and criminal relations. He
could reproach his conscience with no sinful act; and yet he was now
suffering the punishment of sin in its most acute and cruel forms—the
dread of punishment, the suspicions of the good, and the companionship
and contamination of vile and brutal natures. He felt he could lay his
life down with gladness to escape from the room and the society of Mr.
Raeburn.

“And now,” said the latter, after he had separated the jewels into two
nearly equal parts, and drawn one of them nearer to himself; “and now,”
said he, “everything in this world has to be paid for, and some things
sweetly. You must know, Mr. Hartley, if such be your name, that I am a
man of a very easy temper, and good nature has been my stumbling-block
from first to last. I could pocket the whole of these pretty pebbles,
if I chose, and I should like to see you dare to say a word; but I
think I must have taken a liking to you; for I declare I have not the
heart to shave you so close. So, do you see, in pure kind feeling, I
propose that we divide; and these,” indicating the two heaps, “are the
proportions that seem to me just and friendly. Do you see any
objection, Mr. Hartley, may I ask? I am not the man to stick upon a
brooch.”

“But, sir,” cried Harry, “what you propose to me is impossible. The
jewels are not mine, and I cannot share what is another’s, no matter
with whom, nor in what proportions.”

“They are not yours, are they not?” returned Raeburn. “And you could
not share them with anybody, couldn’t you? Well now, that is what I
call a pity; for here am I obliged to take you to the station. The
police—think of that,” he continued; “think of the disgrace for your
respectable parents; think,” he went on, taking Harry by the wrist;
“think of the Colonies and the Day of Judgment.”

“I cannot help it,” wailed Harry. “It is not my fault. You will not
come with me to Eaton Place?”

“No,” replied the man, “I will not, that is certain. And I mean to
divide these playthings with you here.”

And so saying he applied a sudden and severe torsion to the lad’s
wrist.

Harry could not suppress a scream, and the perspiration burst forth
upon his face. Perhaps pain and terror quickened his intelligence, but
certainly at that moment the whole business flashed across him in
another light; and he saw that there was nothing for it but to accede
to the ruffian’s proposal, and trust to find the house and force him to
disgorge, under more favourable circumstances, and when he himself was
clear from all suspicion.

“I agree,” he said.

“There is a lamb,” sneered the gardener. “I thought you would recognise
your interests at last. This bandbox,” he continued, “I shall burn with
my rubbish; it is a thing that curious folk might recognise; and as for
you, scrape up your gaieties and put them in your pocket.”

Harry proceeded to obey, Raeburn watching him, and every now and again
his greed rekindled by some bright scintillation, abstracting another
jewel from the secretary’s share, and adding it to his own.

When this was finished, both proceeded to the front door, which Raeburn
cautiously opened to observe the street. This was apparently clear of
passengers; for he suddenly seized Harry by the nape of the neck, and
holding his face downward so that he could see nothing but the roadway
and the doorsteps of the houses, pushed him violently before him down
one street and up another for the space of perhaps a minute and a half.
Harry had counted three corners before the bully relaxed his grasp, and
crying, “Now be off with you!” sent the lad flying head foremost with a
well-directed and athletic kick.

When Harry gathered himself up, half-stunned and bleeding freely at the
nose, Mr. Raeburn had entirely disappeared. For the first time, anger
and pain so completely overcame the lad’s spirits that he burst into a
fit of tears and remained sobbing in the middle of the road.

After he had thus somewhat assuaged his emotion, he began to look about
him and read the names of the streets at whose intersection he had been
deserted by the gardener. He was still in an unfrequented portion of
West London, among villas and large gardens; but he could see some
persons at a window who had evidently witnessed his misfortune; and
almost immediately after a servant came running from the house and
offered him a glass of water. At the same time, a dirty rogue, who had
been slouching somewhere in the neighbourhood, drew near him from the
other side.

“Poor fellow,” said the maid, “how vilely you have been handled, to be
sure! Why, your knees are all cut, and your clothes ruined! Do you know
the wretch who used you so?”

“That I do!” cried Harry, who was somewhat refreshed by the water; “and
shall run him home in spite of his precautions. He shall pay dearly for
this day’s work, I promise you.”

“You had better come into the house and have yourself washed and
brushed,” continued the maid. “My mistress will make you welcome, never
fear. And see, I will pick up your hat. Why, love of mercy!” she
screamed, “if you have not dropped diamonds all over the street!”

Such was the case; a good half of what remained to him after the
depredations of Mr. Raeburn, had been shaken out of his pockets by the
summersault and once more lay glittering on the ground. He blessed his
fortune that the maid had been so quick of eye; “there is nothing so
bad but it might be worse,” thought he; and the recovery of these few
seemed to him almost as great an affair as the loss of all the rest.
But, alas! as he stooped to pick up his treasures, the loiterer made a
rapid onslaught, overset both Harry and the maid with a movement of his
arms, swept up a double handful of the diamonds, and made off along the
street with an amazing swiftness.

Harry, as soon as he could get upon his feet, gave chase to the
miscreant with many cries, but the latter was too fleet of foot, and
probably too well acquainted with the locality; for turn where the
pursuer would he could find no traces of the fugitive.

In the deepest despondency, Harry revisited the scene of his mishap,
where the maid, who was still waiting, very honestly returned him his
hat and the remainder of the fallen diamonds. Harry thanked her from
his heart, and being now in no humour for economy, made his way to the
nearest cab-stand and set off for Eaton Place by coach.

The house, on his arrival, seemed in some confusion, as if a
catastrophe had happened in the family; and the servants clustered
together in the hall, and were unable, or perhaps not altogether
anxious, to suppress their merriment at the tatterdemalion figure of
the secretary. He passed them with as good an air of dignity as he
could assume, and made directly for the boudoir. When he opened the
door an astonishing and even menacing spectacle presented itself to his
eyes; for he beheld the General and his wife and, of all people,
Charlie Pendragon, closeted together and speaking with earnestness and
gravity on some important subject. Harry saw at once that there was
little left for him to explain—plenary confession had plainly been made
to the General of the intended fraud upon his pocket, and the
unfortunate miscarriage of the scheme; and they had all made common
cause against a common danger.

“Thank Heaven!” cried Lady Vandeleur, “here he is! The bandbox,
Harry—the bandbox!”

But Harry stood before them silent and downcast.

“Speak!” she cried. “Speak! Where is the bandbox?”

And the men, with threatening gestures, repeated the demand.

Harry drew a handful of jewels from his pocket. He was very white.

“This is all that remains,” said he. “I declare before Heaven it was
through no fault of mine; and if you will have patience, although some
are lost, I am afraid, for ever, others, I am sure, may be still
recovered.”

“Alas!” cried Lady Vandeleur, “all our diamonds are gone, and I owe
ninety thousand pounds for dress!”

“Madam,” said the General, “you might have paved the gutter with your
own trash; you might have made debts to fifty times the sum you
mention; you might have robbed me of my mother’s coronet and ring; and
Nature might have still so far prevailed that I could have forgiven you
at last. But, madam, you have taken the Rajah’s Diamond—the Eye of
Light, as the Orientals poetically termed it—the Pride of Kashgar! You
have taken from me the Rajah’s Diamond,” he cried, raising his hands,
“and all, madam, all is at an end between us!”

“Believe me, General Vandeleur,” she replied, “that is one of the most
agreeable speeches that ever I heard from your lips; and since we are
to be ruined, I could almost welcome the change, if it delivers me from
you. You have told me often enough that I married you for your money;
let me tell you now that I always bitterly repented the bargain; and if
you were still marriageable, and had a diamond bigger than your head, I
should counsel even my maid against a union so uninviting and
disastrous. As for you, Mr. Hartley,” she continued, turning on the
secretary, “you have sufficiently exhibited your valuable qualities in
this house; we are now persuaded that you equally lack manhood, sense,
and self-respect; and I can see only one course open for you—to
withdraw instanter, and, if possible, return no more. For your wages
you may rank as a creditor in my late husband’s bankruptcy.”

Harry had scarcely comprehended this insulting address before the
General was down upon him with another.

“And in the meantime,” said that personage, “follow me before the
nearest Inspector of Police. You may impose upon a simple-minded
soldier, sir, but the eye of the law will read your disreputable
secret. If I must spend my old age in poverty through your underhand
intriguing with my wife, I mean at least that you shall not remain
unpunished for your pains; and God, sir, will deny me a very
considerable satisfaction if you do not pick oakum from now until your
dying day.”

With that, the General dragged Harry from the apartment, and hurried
him downstairs and along the street to the police-station of the
district.


_Here_ (says my Arabian author) _ended this deplorable business of the
bandbox_. _But to the unfortunate Secretary the whole affair was the
beginning of a new and manlier life_. _The police were easily persuaded
of his innocence_; _and_, _after he had given what help he could in the
subsequent investigations_, _he was even complemented by one of the
chiefs of the detective department on the probity and simplicity of his
behaviour_. _Several persons interested themselves in one so
unfortunate_; _and soon after he inherited a sum of money from a maiden
aunt in Worcestershire_. _With this he married Prudence_, _and set sail
for Bendigo_, _or according to another account_, _for Trincomalee_,
_exceedingly content_, _and will the best of prospects_.




STORY OF THE YOUNG MAN IN HOLY ORDERS


The Reverend Mr. Simon Rolles had distinguished himself in the Moral
Sciences, and was more than usually proficient in the study of
Divinity. His essay “On the Christian Doctrine of the Social
Obligations” obtained for him, at the moment of its production, a
certain celebrity in the University of Oxford; and it was understood in
clerical and learned circles that young Mr. Rolles had in contemplation
a considerable work—a folio, it was said—on the authority of the
Fathers of the Church. These attainments, these ambitious designs,
however, were far from helping him to any preferment; and he was still
in quest of his first curacy when a chance ramble in that part of
London, the peaceful and rich aspect of the garden, a desire for
solitude and study, and the cheapness of the lodging, led him to take
up his abode with Mr. Raeburn, the nurseryman of Stockdove Lane.

It was his habit every afternoon, after he had worked seven or eight
hours on St. Ambrose or St. Chrysostom, to walk for a while in
meditation among the roses. And this was usually one of the most
productive moments of his day. But even a sincere appetite for thought,
and the excitement of grave problems awaiting solution, are not always
sufficient to preserve the mind of the philosopher against the petty
shocks and contacts of the world. And when Mr. Rolles found General
Vandeleur’s secretary, ragged and bleeding, in the company of his
landlord; when he saw both change colour and seek to avoid his
questions; and, above all, when the former denied his own identity with
the most unmoved assurance, he speedily forgot the Saints and Fathers
in the vulgar interest of curiosity.

“I cannot be mistaken,” thought he. “That is Mr. Hartley beyond a
doubt. How comes he in such a pickle? why does he deny his name? and
what can be his business with that black-looking ruffian, my landlord?”

As he was thus reflecting, another peculiar circumstance attracted his
attention. The face of Mr. Raeburn appeared at a low window next the
door; and, as chance directed, his eyes met those of Mr. Rolles. The
nurseryman seemed disconcerted, and even alarmed; and immediately after
the blind of the apartment was pulled sharply down.

“This may all be very well,” reflected Mr. Rolles; “it may be all
excellently well; but I confess freely that I do not think so.
Suspicious, underhand, untruthful, fearful of observation—I believe
upon my soul,” he thought, “the pair are plotting some disgraceful
action.”

The detective that there is in all of us awoke and became clamant in
the bosom of Mr. Rolles; and with a brisk, eager step, that bore no
resemblance to his usual gait, he proceeded to make the circuit of the
garden. When he came to the scene of Harry’s escalade, his eye was at
once arrested by a broken rosebush and marks of trampling on the mould.
He looked up, and saw scratches on the brick, and a rag of trouser
floating from a broken bottle. This, then, was the mode of entrance
chosen by Mr. Raeburn’s particular friend! It was thus that General
Vandeleur’s secretary came to admire a flower-garden! The young
clergyman whistled softly to himself as he stooped to examine the
ground. He could make out where Harry had landed from his perilous
leap; he recognised the flat foot of Mr. Raeburn where it had sunk
deeply in the soil as he pulled up the Secretary by the collar; nay, on
a closer inspection, he seemed to distinguish the marks of groping
fingers, as though something had been spilt abroad and eagerly
collected.

“Upon my word,” he thought, “the thing grows vastly interesting.”

And just then he caught sight of something almost entirely buried in
the earth. In an instant he had disinterred a dainty morocco case,
ornamented and clasped in gilt. It had been trodden heavily underfoot,
and thus escaped the hurried search of Mr. Raeburn. Mr. Rolles opened
the case, and drew a long breath of almost horrified astonishment; for
there lay before him, in a cradle of green velvet, a diamond of
prodigious magnitude and of the finest water. It was of the bigness of
a duck’s egg; beautifully shaped, and without a flaw; and as the sun
shone upon it, it gave forth a lustre like that of electricity, and
seemed to burn in his hand with a thousand internal fires.

He knew little of precious stones; but the Rajah’s Diamond was a wonder
that explained itself; a village child, if he found it, would run
screaming for the nearest cottage; and a savage would prostrate himself
in adoration before so imposing a fetish. The beauty of the stone
flattered the young clergyman’s eyes; the thought of its incalculable
value overpowered his intellect. He knew that what he held in his hand
was worth more than many years’ purchase of an archiepiscopal see; that
it would build cathedrals more stately than Ely or Cologne; that he who
possessed it was set free for ever from the primal curse, and might
follow his own inclinations without concern or hurry, without let or
hindrance. And as he suddenly turned it, the rays leaped forth again
with renewed brilliancy, and seemed to pierce his very heart.

Decisive actions are often taken in a moment and without any conscious
deliverance from the rational parts of man. So it was now with Mr.
Rolles. He glanced hurriedly round; beheld, like Mr. Raeburn before
him, nothing but the sunlit flower-garden, the tall tree-tops, and the
house with blinded windows; and in a trice he had shut the case, thrust
it into his pocket, and was hastening to his study with the speed of
guilt.

The Reverend Simon Rolles had stolen the Rajah’s Diamond.

Early in the afternoon the police arrived with Harry Hartley. The
nurseryman, who was beside himself with terror, readily discovered his
hoard; and the jewels were identified and inventoried in the presence
of the Secretary. As for Mr. Rolles, he showed himself in a most
obliging temper, communicated what he knew with freedom, and professed
regret that he could do no more to help the officers in their duty.

“Still,” he added, “I suppose your business is nearly at an end.”

“By no means,” replied the man from Scotland Yard; and he narrated the
second robbery of which Harry had been the immediate victim, and gave
the young clergyman a description of the more important jewels that
were still not found, dilating particularly on the Rajah’s Diamond.

“It must be worth a fortune,” observed Mr. Rolles.

“Ten fortunes—twenty fortunes,” cried the officer.

“The more it is worth,” remarked Simon shrewdly, “the more difficult it
must be to sell. Such a thing has a physiognomy not to be disguised,
and I should fancy a man might as easily negotiate St. Paul’s
Cathedral.”

“Oh, truly!” said the officer; “but if the thief be a man of any
intelligence, he will cut it into three or four, and there will be
still enough to make him rich.”

“Thank you,” said the clergyman. “You cannot imagine how much your
conversation interests me.”

Whereupon the functionary admitted that they knew many strange things
in his profession, and immediately after took his leave.

Mr. Rolles regained his apartment. It seemed smaller and barer than
usual; the materials for his great work had never presented so little
interest; and he looked upon his library with the eye of scorn. He took
down, volume by volume, several Fathers of the Church, and glanced them
through; but they contained nothing to his purpose.

“These old gentlemen,” thought he, “are no doubt very valuable writers,
but they seem to me conspicuously ignorant of life. Here am I, with
learning enough to be a Bishop, and I positively do not know how to
dispose of a stolen diamond. I glean a hint from a common policeman,
and, with all my folios, I cannot so much as put it into execution.
This inspires me with very low ideas of University training.”

Herewith he kicked over his book-shelf and, putting on his hat,
hastened from the house to the club of which he was a member. In such a
place of mundane resort he hoped to find some man of good counsel and a
shrewd experience in life. In the reading-room he saw many of the
country clergy and an Archdeacon; there were three journalists and a
writer upon the Higher Metaphysic, playing pool; and at dinner only the
raff of ordinary club frequenters showed their commonplace and
obliterated countenances. None of these, thought Mr. Rolles, would know
more on dangerous topics than he knew himself; none of them were fit to
give him guidance in his present strait. At length in the smoking-room,
up many weary stairs, he hit upon a gentleman of somewhat portly build
and dressed with conspicuous plainness. He was smoking a cigar and
reading the _Fortnightly Review_; his face was singularly free from all
sign of preoccupation or fatigue; and there was something in his air
which seemed to invite confidence and to expect submission. The more
the young clergyman scrutinised his features, the more he was convinced
that he had fallen on one capable of giving pertinent advice.

“Sir,” said he, “you will excuse my abruptness; but I judge you from
your appearance to be pre-eminently a man of the world.”

“I have indeed considerable claims to that distinction,” replied the
stranger, laying aside his magazine with a look of mingled amusement
and surprise.

“I, sir,” continued the Curate, “am a recluse, a student, a creature of
ink-bottles and patristic folios. A recent event has brought my folly
vividly before my eyes, and I desire to instruct myself in life. By
life,” he added, “I do not mean Thackeray’s novels; but the crimes and
secret possibilities of our society, and the principles of wise conduct
among exceptional events. I am a patient reader; can the thing be
learnt in books?”

“You put me in a difficulty,” said the stranger. “I confess I have no
great notion of the use of books, except to amuse a railway journey;
although, I believe, there are some very exact treatises on astronomy,
the use of the globes, agriculture, and the art of making paper
flowers. Upon the less apparent provinces of life I fear you will find
nothing truthful. Yet stay,” he added, “have you read Gaboriau?”

Mr. Rolles admitted he had never even heard the name.

“You may gather some notions from Gaboriau,” resumed the stranger. “He
is at least suggestive; and as he is an author much studied by Prince
Bismarck, you will, at the worst, lose your time in good society.”

“Sir,” said the Curate, “I am infinitely obliged by your politeness.”

“You have already more than repaid me,” returned the other.

“How?” inquired Simon.

“By the novelty of your request,” replied the gentleman; and with a
polite gesture, as though to ask permission, he resumed the study of
the _Fortnightly Review_.

On his way home Mr. Rolles purchased a work on precious stones and
several of Gaboriau’s novels. These last he eagerly skimmed until an
advanced hour in the morning; but although they introduced him to many
new ideas, he could nowhere discover what to do with a stolen diamond.
He was annoyed, moreover, to find the information scattered amongst
romantic story-telling, instead of soberly set forth after the manner
of a manual; and he concluded that, even if the writer had thought much
upon these subjects, he was totally lacking in educational method. For
the character and attainments of Lecoq, however, he was unable to
contain his admiration.

“He was truly a great creature,” ruminated Mr. Rolles. “He knew the
world as I know Paley’s Evidences. There was nothing that he could not
carry to a termination with his own hand, and against the largest odds.
Heavens!” he broke out suddenly, “is not this the lesson? Must I not
learn to cut diamonds for myself?”

It seemed to him as if he had sailed at once out of his perplexities;
he remembered that he knew a jeweller, one B. Macculloch, in Edinburgh,
who would be glad to put him in the way of the necessary training; a
few months, perhaps a few years, of sordid toil, and he would be
sufficiently expert to divide and sufficiently cunning to dispose with
advantage of the Rajah’s Diamond. That done, he might return to pursue
his researches at leisure, a wealthy and luxurious student, envied and
respected by all. Golden visions attended him through his slumber, and
he awoke refreshed and light-hearted with the morning sun.

Mr. Raeburn’s house was on that day to be closed by the police, and
this afforded a pretext for his departure. He cheerfully prepared his
baggage, transported it to King’s Cross, where he left it in the
cloak-room, and returned to the club to while away the afternoon and
dine.

“If you dine here to-day, Rolles,” observed an acquaintance, “you may
see two of the most remarkable men in England—Prince Florizel of
Bohemia, and old Jack Vandeleur.”

“I have heard of the Prince,” replied Mr. Rolles; “and General
Vandeleur I have even met in society.”

“General Vandeleur is an ass!” returned the other. “This is his brother
John, the biggest adventurer, the best judge of precious stones, and
one of the most acute diplomatists in Europe. Have you never heard of
his duel with the Duc de Val d’Orge? of his exploits and atrocities
when he was Dictator of Paraguay? of his dexterity in recovering Sir
Samuel Levi’s jewellery? nor of his services in the Indian
Mutiny—services by which the Government profited, but which the
Government dared not recognise? You make me wonder what we mean by
fame, or even by infamy; for Jack Vandeleur has prodigious claims to
both. Run downstairs,” he continued, “take a table near them, and keep
your ears open. You will hear some strange talk, or I am much misled.”

“But how shall I know them?” inquired the clergyman.

“Know them!” cried his friend; “why, the Prince is the finest gentleman
in Europe, the only living creature who looks like a king; and as for
Jack Vandeleur, if you can imagine Ulysses at seventy years of age, and
with a sabre-cut across his face, you have the man before you! Know
them, indeed! Why, you could pick either of them out of a Derby day!”

Rolles eagerly hurried to the dining-room. It was as his friend had
asserted; it was impossible to mistake the pair in question. Old John
Vandeleur was of a remarkable force of body, and obviously broken to
the most difficult exercises. He had neither the carriage of a
swordsman, nor of a sailor, nor yet of one much inured to the saddle;
but something made up of all these, and the result and expression of
many different habits and dexterities. His features were bold and
aquiline; his expression arrogant and predatory; his whole appearance
that of a swift, violent, unscrupulous man of action; and his copious
white hair and the deep sabre-cut that traversed his nose and temple
added a note of savagery to a head already remarkable and menacing in
itself.

In his companion, the Prince of Bohemia, Mr. Rolles was astonished to
recognise the gentleman who had recommended him the study of Gaboriau.
Doubtless Prince Florizel, who rarely visited the club, of which, as of
most others, he was an honorary member, had been waiting for John
Vandeleur when Simon accosted him on the previous evening.

The other diners had modestly retired into the angles of the room, and
left the distinguished pair in a certain isolation, but the young
clergyman was unrestrained by any sentiment of awe, and, marching
boldly up, took his place at the nearest table.

The conversation was, indeed, new to the student’s ears. The
ex-Dictator of Paraguay stated many extraordinary experiences in
different quarters of the world; and the Prince supplied a commentary
which, to a man of thought, was even more interesting than the events
themselves. Two forms of experience were thus brought together and laid
before the young clergyman; and he did not know which to admire the
most—the desperate actor or the skilled expert in life; the man who
spoke boldly of his own deeds and perils, or the man who seemed, like a
god, to know all things and to have suffered nothing. The manner of
each aptly fitted with his part in the discourse. The Dictator indulged
in brutalities alike of speech and gesture; his hand opened and shut
and fell roughly on the table; and his voice was loud and heavy. The
Prince, on the other hand, seemed the very type of urbane docility and
quiet; the least movement, the least inflection, had with him a
weightier significance than all the shouts and pantomime of his
companion; and if ever, as must frequently have been the case, he
described some experience personal to himself, it was so aptly
dissimulated as to pass unnoticed with the rest.

At length the talk wandered on to the late robberies and the Rajah’s
Diamond.

“That diamond would be better in the sea,” observed Prince Florizel.

“As a Vandeleur,” replied the Dictator, “your Highness may imagine my
dissent.”

“I speak on grounds of public policy,” pursued the Prince. “Jewels so
valuable should be reserved for the collection of a Prince or the
treasury of a great nation. To hand them about among the common sort of
men is to set a price on Virtue’s head; and if the Rajah of Kashgar—a
Prince, I understand, of great enlightenment—desired vengeance upon the
men of Europe, he could hardly have gone more efficaciously about his
purpose than by sending us this apple of discord. There is no honesty
too robust for such a trial. I myself, who have many duties and many
privileges of my own—I myself, Mr. Vandeleur, could scarce handle the
intoxicating crystal and be safe. As for you, who are a diamond hunter
by taste and profession, I do not believe there is a crime in the
calendar you would not perpetrate—I do not believe you have a friend in
the world whom you would not eagerly betray—I do not know if you have a
family, but if you have I declare you would sacrifice your children—and
all this for what? Not to be richer, nor to have more comforts or more
respect, but simply to call this diamond yours for a year or two until
you die, and now and again to open a safe and look at it as one looks
at a picture.”

“It is true,” replied Vandeleur. “I have hunted most things, from men
and women down to mosquitos; I have dived for coral; I have followed
both whales and tigers; and a diamond is the tallest quarry of the lot.
It has beauty and worth; it alone can properly reward the ardours of
the chase. At this moment, as your Highness may fancy, I am upon the
trail; I have a sure knack, a wide experience; I know every stone of
price in my brother’s collection as a shepherd knows his sheep; and I
wish I may die if I do not recover them every one!”

“Sir Thomas Vandeleur will have great cause to thank you,” said the
Prince.

“I am not so sure,” returned the Dictator, with a laugh. “One of the
Vandeleurs will. Thomas or John—Peter or Paul—we are all apostles.”

“I did not catch your observation,” said the Prince with some disgust.

And at the same moment the waiter informed Mr. Vandeleur that his cab
was at the door.

Mr. Rolles glanced at the clock, and saw that he also must be moving;
and the coincidence struck him sharply and unpleasantly, for he desired
to see no more of the diamond hunter.

Much study having somewhat shaken the young man’s nerves, he was in the
habit of travelling in the most luxurious manner; and for the present
journey he had taken a sofa in the sleeping carriage.

“You will be very comfortable,” said the guard; “there is no one in
your compartment, and only one old gentleman in the other end.”

It was close upon the hour, and the tickets were being examined, when
Mr. Rolles beheld this other fellow-passenger ushered by several
porters into his place; certainly, there was not another man in the
world whom he would not have preferred—for it was old John Vandeleur,
the ex-Dictator.

The sleeping carriages on the Great Northern line were divided into
three compartments—one at each end for travellers, and one in the
centre fitted with the conveniences of a lavatory. A door running in
grooves separated each of the others from the lavatory; but as there
were neither bolts nor locks, the whole suite was practically common
ground.

When Mr. Rolles had studied his position, he perceived himself without
defence. If the Dictator chose to pay him a visit in the course of the
night, he could do no less than receive it; he had no means of
fortification, and lay open to attack as if he had been lying in the
fields. This situation caused him some agony of mind. He recalled with
alarm the boastful statements of his fellow-traveller across the
dining-table, and the professions of immorality which he had heard him
offering to the disgusted Prince. Some persons, he remembered to have
read, are endowed with a singular quickness of perception for the
neighbourhood of precious metals; through walls and even at
considerable distances they are said to divine the presence of gold.
Might it not be the same with diamonds? he wondered; and if so, who was
more likely to enjoy this transcendental sense than the person who
gloried in the appellation of the Diamond Hunter? From such a man he
recognised that he had everything to fear, and longed eagerly for the
arrival of the day.

In the meantime he neglected no precaution, concealed his diamond in
the most internal pocket of a system of great-coats, and devoutly
recommended himself to the care of Providence.

The train pursued its usual even and rapid course; and nearly half the
journey had been accomplished before slumber began to triumph over
uneasiness in the breast of Mr. Rolles. For some time he resisted its
influence; but it grew upon him more and more, and a little before York
he was fain to stretch himself upon one of the couches and suffer his
eyes to close; and almost at the same instant consciousness deserted
the young clergyman. His last thought was of his terrifying neighbour.

When he awoke it was still pitch dark, except for the flicker of the
veiled lamp; and the continual roaring and oscillation testified to the
unrelaxed velocity of the train. He sat upright in a panic, for he had
been tormented by the most uneasy dreams; it was some seconds before he
recovered his self-command; and even after he had resumed a recumbent
attitude sleep continued to flee him, and he lay awake with his brain
in a state of violent agitation, and his eyes fixed upon the lavatory
door. He pulled his clerical felt hat over his brow still farther to
shield him from the light; and he adopted the usual expedients, such as
counting a thousand or banishing thought, by which experienced invalids
are accustomed to woo the approach of sleep. In the case of Mr. Rolles
they proved one and all vain; he was harassed by a dozen different
anxieties—the old man in the other end of the carriage haunted him in
the most alarming shapes; and in whatever attitude he chose to lie the
diamond in his pocket occasioned him a sensible physical distress. It
burned, it was too large, it bruised his ribs; and there were
infinitesimal fractions of a second in which he had half a mind to
throw it from the window.

While he was thus lying, a strange incident took place.

The sliding-door into the lavatory stirred a little, and then a little
more, and was finally drawn back for the space of about twenty inches.
The lamp in the lavatory was unshaded, and in the lighted aperture thus
disclosed, Mr. Rolles could see the head of Mr. Vandeleur in an
attitude of deep attention. He was conscious that the gaze of the
Dictator rested intently on his own face; and the instinct of
self-preservation moved him to hold his breath, to refrain from the
least movement, and keeping his eyes lowered, to watch his visitor from
underneath the lashes. After about a moment, the head was withdrawn and
the door of the lavatory replaced.

The Dictator had not come to attack, but to observe; his action was not
that of a man threatening another, but that of a man who was himself
threatened; if Mr. Rolles was afraid of him, it appeared that he, in
his turn, was not quite easy on the score of Mr. Rolles. He had come,
it would seem, to make sure that his only fellow-traveller was asleep;
and, when satisfied on that point, he had at once withdrawn.

The clergyman leaped to his feet. The extreme of terror had given place
to a reaction of foolhardy daring. He reflected that the rattle of the
flying train concealed all other sounds, and determined, come what
might, to return the visit he had just received. Divesting himself of
his cloak, which might have interfered with the freedom of his action,
he entered the lavatory and paused to listen. As he had expected, there
was nothing to be heard above the roar of the train’s progress; and
laying his hand on the door at the farther side, he proceeded
cautiously to draw it back for about six inches. Then he stopped, and
could not contain an ejaculation of surprise.

John Vandeleur wore a fur travelling cap with lappets to protect his
ears; and this may have combined with the sound of the express to keep
him in ignorance of what was going forward. It is certain, at least,
that he did not raise his head, but continued without interruption to
pursue his strange employment. Between his feet stood an open hat-box;
in one hand he held the sleeve of his sealskin great-coat; in the other
a formidable knife, with which he had just slit up the lining of the
sleeve. Mr. Rolles had read of persons carrying money in a belt; and as
he had no acquaintance with any but cricket-belts, he had never been
able rightly to conceive how this was managed. But here was a stranger
thing before his eyes; for John Vandeleur, it appeared, carried
diamonds in the lining of his sleeve; and even as the young clergyman
gazed, he could see one glittering brilliant drop after another into
the hat-box.

He stood riveted to the spot, following this unusual business with his
eyes. The diamonds were, for the most part, small, and not easily
distinguishable either in shape or fire. Suddenly the Dictator appeared
to find a difficulty; he employed both hands and stooped over his task;
but it was not until after considerable manoeuvring that he extricated
a large tiara of diamonds from the lining, and held it up for some
seconds’ examination before he placed it with the others in the
hat-box. The tiara was a ray of light to Mr. Rolles; he immediately
recognised it for a part of the treasure stolen from Harry Hartley by
the loiterer. There was no room for mistake; it was exactly as the
detective had described it; there were the ruby stars, with a great
emerald in the centre; there were the interlacing crescents; and there
were the pear-shaped pendants, each a single stone, which gave a
special value to Lady Vandeleur’s tiara.

Mr. Rolles was hugely relieved. The Dictator was as deeply in the
affair as he was; neither could tell tales upon the other. In the first
glow of happiness, the clergyman suffered a deep sigh to escape him;
and as his bosom had become choked and his throat dry during his
previous suspense, the sigh was followed by a cough.

Mr. Vandeleur looked up; his face contracted with the blackest and most
deadly passion; his eyes opened widely, and his under jaw dropped in an
astonishment that was upon the brink of fury. By an instinctive
movement he had covered the hat-box with the coat. For half a minute
the two men stared upon each other in silence. It was not a long
interval, but it sufficed for Mr. Rolles; he was one of those who think
swiftly on dangerous occasions; he decided on a course of action of a
singularly daring nature; and although he felt he was setting his life
upon the hazard, he was the first to break silence.

“I beg your pardon,” said he.

The Dictator shivered slightly, and when he spoke his voice was hoarse.

“What do you want here?” he asked.

“I take a particular interest in diamonds,” replied Mr. Rolles, with an
air of perfect self-possession. “Two connoisseurs should be acquainted.
I have here a trifle of my own which may perhaps serve for an
introduction.”

And so saying, he quietly took the case from his pocket, showed the
Rajah’s Diamond to the Dictator for an instant, and replaced it in
security.

“It was once your brother’s,” he added.

John Vandeleur continued to regard him with a look of almost painful
amazement; but he neither spoke nor moved.

“I was pleased to observe,” resumed the young man, “that we have gems
from the same collection.”

The Dictator’s surprise overpowered him.

“I beg your pardon,” he said; “I begin to perceive that I am growing
old! I am positively not prepared for little incidents like this. But
set my mind at rest upon one point: do my eyes deceive me, or are you
indeed a parson?”

“I am in holy orders,” answered Mr. Rolles.

“Well,” cried the other, “as long as I live I will never hear another
word against the cloth!”

“You flatter me,” said Mr. Rolles.

“Pardon me,” replied Vandeleur; “pardon me, young man. You are no
coward, but it still remains to be seen whether you are not the worst
of fools. Perhaps,” he continued, leaning back upon his seat, “perhaps
you would oblige me with a few particulars. I must suppose you had some
object in the stupefying impudence of your proceedings, and I confess I
have a curiosity to know it.”

“It is very simple,” replied the clergyman; “it proceeds from my great
inexperience of life.”

“I shall be glad to be persuaded,” answered Vandeleur.

Whereupon Mr. Rolles told him the whole story of his connection with
the Rajah’s Diamond, from the time he found it in Raeburn’s garden to
the time when he left London in the Flying Scotchman. He added a brief
sketch of his feelings and thoughts during the journey, and concluded
in these words:—

“When I recognised the tiara I knew we were in the same attitude
towards Society, and this inspired me with a hope, which I trust you
will say was not ill-founded, that you might become in some sense my
partner in the difficulties and, of course, the profits of my
situation. To one of your special knowledge and obviously great
experience the negotiation of the diamond would give but little
trouble, while to me it was a matter of impossibility. On the other
part, I judged that I might lose nearly as much by cutting the diamond,
and that not improbably with an unskilful hand, as might enable me to
pay you with proper generosity for your assistance. The subject was a
delicate one to broach; and perhaps I fell short in delicacy. But I
must ask you to remember that for me the situation was a new one, and I
was entirely unacquainted with the etiquette in use. I believe without
vanity that I could have married or baptized you in a very acceptable
manner; but every man has his own aptitudes, and this sort of bargain
was not among the list of my accomplishments.”

“I do not wish to flatter you,” replied Vandeleur; “but upon my word,
you have an unusual disposition for a life of crime. You have more
accomplishments than you imagine; and though I have encountered a
number of rogues in different quarters of the world, I never met with
one so unblushing as yourself. Cheer up, Mr. Rolles, you are in the
right profession at last! As for helping you, you may command me as you
will. I have only a day’s business in Edinburgh on a little matter for
my brother; and once that is concluded, I return to Paris, where I
usually reside. If you please, you may accompany me thither. And before
the end of a month I believe I shall have brought your little business
to a satisfactory conclusion.”

STORY OF THE HOUSE WITH THE GREEN BLINDS


Francis Scrymgeour, a clerk in the Bank of Scotland at Edinburgh, had
attained the age of twenty-five in a sphere of quiet, creditable, and
domestic life. His mother died while he was young; but his father, a
man of sense and probity, had given him an excellent education at
school, and brought him up at home to orderly and frugal habits.
Francis, who was of a docile and affectionate disposition, profited by
these advantages with zeal, and devoted himself heart and soul to his
employment. A walk upon Saturday afternoon, an occasional dinner with
members of his family, and a yearly tour of a fortnight in the
Highlands or even on the continent of Europe, were his principal
distractions, and, he grew rapidly in favour with his superiors, and
enjoyed already a salary of nearly two hundred pounds a year, with the
prospect of an ultimate advance to almost double that amount. Few young
men were more contented, few more willing and laborious than Francis
Scrymgeour. Sometimes at night, when he had read the daily paper, he
would play upon the flute to amuse his father, for whose qualities he
entertained a great respect.

One day he received a note from a well-known firm of Writers to the
Signet, requesting the favour of an immediate interview with him. The
letter was marked “Private and Confidential,” and had been addressed to
him at the bank, instead of at home—two unusual circumstances which
made him obey the summons with the more alacrity. The senior member of
the firm, a man of much austerity of manner, made him gravely welcome,
requested him to take a seat, and proceeded to explain the matter in
hand in the picked expressions of a veteran man of business. A person,
who must remain nameless, but of whom the lawyer had every reason to
think well—a man, in short, of some station in the country—desired to
make Francis an annual allowance of five hundred pounds. The capital
was to be placed under the control of the lawyer’s firm and two
trustees who must also remain anonymous. There were conditions annexed
to this liberality, but he was of opinion that his new client would
find nothing either excessive or dishonourable in the terms; and he
repeated these two words with emphasis, as though he desired to commit
himself to nothing more.

Francis asked their nature.

“The conditions,” said the Writer to the Signet, “are, as I have twice
remarked, neither dishonourable nor excessive. At the same time I
cannot conceal from you that they are most unusual. Indeed, the whole
case is very much out of our way; and I should certainly have refused
it had it not been for the reputation of the gentleman who entrusted it
to my care, and, let me add, Mr. Scrymgeour, the interest I have been
led to take in yourself by many complimentary and, I have no doubt,
well-deserved reports.”

Francis entreated him to be more specific.

“You cannot picture my uneasiness as to these conditions,” he said.

“They are two,” replied the lawyer, “only two; and the sum, as you will
remember, is five hundred a-year—and unburdened, I forgot to add,
unburdened.”

And the lawyer raised his eyebrows at him with solemn gusto.

“The first,” he resumed, “is of remarkable simplicity. You must be in
Paris by the afternoon of Sunday, the 15th; there you will find, at the
box-office of the Comédie Française, a ticket for admission taken in
your name and waiting you. You are requested to sit out the whole
performance in the seat provided, and that is all.”

“I should certainly have preferred a week-day,” replied Francis. “ But,
after all, once in a way—”

“And in Paris, my dear sir,” added the lawyer soothingly. “I believe I
am something of a precisian myself, but upon such a consideration, and
in Paris, I should not hesitate an instant.”

And the pair laughed pleasantly together.

“The other is of more importance,” continued the Writer to the Signet.
“It regards your marriage. My client, taking a deep interest in your
welfare, desires to advise you absolutely in the choice of a wife.
Absolutely, you understand,” he repeated.

“Let us be more explicit, if you please,” returned Francis. “Am I to
marry any one, maid or widow, black or white, whom this invisible
person chooses to propose?”

“I was to assure you that suitability of age and position should be a
principle with your benefactor,” replied the lawyer. “As to race, I
confess the difficulty had not occurred to me, and I failed to inquire;
but if you like I will make a note of it at once, and advise you on the
earliest opportunity.”

“Sir,” said Francis, “it remains to be seen whether this whole affair
is not a most unworthy fraud. The circumstances are inexplicable—I had
almost said incredible; and until I see a little more daylight, and
some plausible motive, I confess I should be very sorry to put a hand
to the transaction. I appeal to you in this difficulty for information.
I must learn what is at the bottom of it all. If you do not know,
cannot guess, or are not at liberty to tell me, I shall take my hat and
go back to my bank as came.”

“I do not know,” answered the lawyer, “but I have an excellent guess.
Your father, and no one else, is at the root of this apparently
unnatural business.”

“My father!” cried Francis, in extreme disdain. “Worthy man, I know
every thought of his mind, every penny of his fortune!”

“You misinterpret my words,” said the lawyer. “I do not refer to Mr.
Scrymgeour, senior; for he is not your father. When he and his wife
came to Edinburgh, you were already nearly one year old, and you had
not yet been three months in their care. The secret has been well kept;
but such is the fact. Your father is unknown, and I say again that I
believe him to be the original of the offers I am charged at present to
transmit to you.”

It would be impossible to exaggerate the astonishment of Francis
Scrymgeour at this unexpected information. He pled this confusion to
the lawyer.

“Sir,” said he, “after a piece of news so startling, you must grant me
some hours for thought. You shall know this evening what conclusion I
have reached.”

The lawyer commended his prudence; and Francis, excusing himself upon
some pretext at the bank, took a long walk into the country, and fully
considered the different steps and aspects of the case. A pleasant
sense of his own importance rendered him the more deliberate: but the
issue was from the first not doubtful. His whole carnal man leaned
irresistibly towards the five hundred a year, and the strange
conditions with which it was burdened; he discovered in his heart an
invincible repugnance to the name of Scrymgeour, which he had never
hitherto disliked; he began to despise the narrow and unromantic
interests of his former life; and when once his mind was fairly made
up, he walked with a new feeling of strength and freedom, and nourished
himself with the gayest anticipations.

He said but a word to the lawyer, and immediately received a cheque for
two quarters’ arrears; for the allowance was ante-dated from the first
of January. With this in his pocket, he walked home. The flat in
Scotland Street looked mean in his eyes; his nostrils, for the first
time, rebelled against the odour of broth; and he observed little
defects of manner in his adoptive father which filled him with surprise
and almost with disgust. The next day, he determined, should see him on
his way to Paris.

In that city, where he arrived long before the appointed date, he put
up at a modest hotel frequented by English and Italians, and devoted
himself to improvement in the French tongue; for this purpose he had a
master twice a week, entered into conversation with loiterers in the
Champs Elysées, and nightly frequented the theatre. He had his whole
toilette fashionably renewed; and was shaved and had his hair dressed
every morning by a barber in a neighbouring street. This gave him
something of a foreign air, and seemed to wipe off the reproach of his
past years.

At length, on the Saturday afternoon, he betook himself to the
box-office of the theatre in the Rue Richelieu. No sooner had he
mentioned his name than the clerk produced the order in an envelope of
which the address was scarcely dry.

“It has been taken this moment,” said the clerk.

“Indeed!” said Francis. “May I ask what the gentleman was like?”

“Your friend is easy to describe,” replied the official. “He is old and
strong and beautiful, with white hair and a sabre-cut across his face.
You cannot fail to recognise so marked a person.”

“No, indeed,” returned Francis; “and I thank you for your politeness.”

“He cannot yet be far distant,” added the clerk. “If you make haste you
might still overtake him.”

Francis did not wait to be twice told; he ran precipitately from the
theatre into the middle of the street and looked in all directions.
More than one white-haired man was within sight; but though he overtook
each of them in succession, all wanted the sabre-cut. For nearly
half-an-hour he tried one street after another in the neighbourhood,
until at length, recognising the folly of continued search, he started
on a walk to compose his agitated feelings; for this proximity of an
encounter with him to whom he could not doubt he owed the day had
profoundly moved the young man.

It chanced that his way lay up the Rue Drouot and thence up the Rue des
Martyrs; and chance, in this case, served him better than all the
forethought in the world. For on the outer boulevard he saw two men in
earnest colloquy upon a seat. One was dark, young, and handsome,
secularly dressed, but with an indelible clerical stamp; the other
answered in every particular to the description given him by the clerk.
Francis felt his heart beat high in his bosom; he knew he was now about
to hear the voice of his father; and making a wide circuit, he
noiselessly took his place behind the couple in question, who were too
much interested in their talk to observe much else. As Francis had
expected, the conversation was conducted in the English language.

“Your suspicions begin to annoy me, Rolles,” said the older man. “I
tell you I am doing my utmost; a man cannot lay his hand on millions in
a moment. Have I not taken you up, a mere stranger, out of pure
good-will? Are you not living largely on my bounty?”

“On your advances, Mr. Vandeleur,” corrected the other.

“Advances, if you choose; and interest instead of goodwill, if you
prefer it,” returned Vandeleur angrily. “I am not here to pick
expressions. Business is business; and your business, let me remind
you, is too muddy for such airs. Trust me, or leave me alone and find
some one else; but let us have an end, for God’s sake, of your
jeremiads.”

“I am beginning to learn the world,” replied the other, “and I see that
you have every reason to play me false, and not one to deal honestly. I
am not here to pick expressions either; you wish the diamond for
yourself; you know you do—you dare not deny it. Have you not already
forged my name, and searched my lodging in my absence? I understand the
cause of your delays; you are lying in wait; you are the diamond
hunter, forsooth; and sooner or later, by fair means or foul, you’ll
lay your hands upon it. I tell you, it must stop; push me much further
and I promise you a surprise.”

“It does not become you to use threats,” returned Vandeleur. “Two can
play at that. My brother is here in Paris; the police are on the alert;
and if you persist in wearying me with your caterwauling, I will
arrange a little astonishment for you, Mr. Rolles. But mine shall be
once and for all. Do you understand, or would you prefer me to tell it
you in Hebrew? There is an end to all things, and you have come to the
end of my patience. Tuesday, at seven; not a day, not an hour sooner,
not the least part of a second, if it were to save your life. And if
you do not choose to wait, you may go to the bottomless pit for me, and
welcome.”

And so saying, the Dictator arose from the bench, and marched off in
the direction of Montmartre, shaking his head and swinging his cane
with a most furious air; while his companion remained where he was, in
an attitude of great dejection.

Francis was at the pitch of surprise and horror; his sentiments had
been shocked to the last degree; the hopeful tenderness with which he
had taken his place upon the bench was transformed into repulsion and
despair; old Mr. Scrymgeour, he reflected, was a far more kindly and
creditable parent than this dangerous and violent intriguer; but he
retained his presence of mind, and suffered not a moment to elapse
before he was on the trail of the Dictator.

That gentleman’s fury carried him forward at a brisk pace, and he was
so completely occupied in his angry thoughts that he never so much as
cast a look behind him till he reached his own door.

His house stood high up in the Rue Lepic, commanding a view of all
Paris and enjoying the pure air of the heights. It was two storeys
high, with green blinds and shutters; and all the windows looking on
the street were hermetically closed. Tops of trees showed over the high
garden wall, and the wall was protected by _chevaux-de-frise_. The
Dictator paused a moment while he searched his pocket for a key; and
then, opening a gate, disappeared within the enclosure.

Francis looked about him; the neighbourhood was very lonely, the house
isolated in its garden. It seemed as if his observation must here come
to an abrupt end. A second glance, however, showed him a tall house
next door presenting a gable to the garden, and in this gable a single
window. He passed to the front and saw a ticket offering unfurnished
lodgings by the month; and, on inquiry, the room which commanded the
Dictator’s garden proved to be one of those to let. Francis did not
hesitate a moment; he took the room, paid an advance upon the rent, and
returned to his hotel to seek his baggage.

The old man with the sabre-cut might or might not be his father; he
might or he might not be upon the true scent; but he was certainly on
the edge of an exciting mystery, and he promised himself that he would
not relax his observation until he had got to the bottom of the secret.

From the window of his new apartment Francis Scrymgeour commanded a
complete view into the garden of the house with the green blinds.
Immediately below him a very comely chestnut with wide boughs sheltered
a pair of rustic tables where people might dine in the height of
summer. On all sides save one a dense vegetation concealed the soil;
but there, between the tables and the house, he saw a patch of gravel
walk leading from the verandah to the garden-gate. Studying the place
from between the boards of the Venetian shutters, which he durst not
open for fear of attracting attention, Francis observed but little to
indicate the manners of the inhabitants, and that little argued no more
than a close reserve and a taste for solitude. The garden was
conventual, the house had the air of a prison. The green blinds were
all drawn down upon the outside; the door into the verandah was closed;
the garden, as far as he could see it, was left entirely to itself in
the evening sunshine. A modest curl of smoke from a single chimney
alone testified to the presence of living people.

In order that he might not be entirely idle, and to give a certain
colour to his way of life, Francis had purchased Euclid’s Geometry in
French, which he set himself to copy and translate on the top of his
portmanteau and seated on the floor against the wall; for he was
equally without chair or table. From time to time he would rise and
cast a glance into the enclosure of the house with the green blinds;
but the windows remained obstinately closed and the garden empty.

Only late in the evening did anything occur to reward his continued
attention. Between nine and ten the sharp tinkle of a bell aroused him
from a fit of dozing; and he sprang to his observatory in time to hear
an important noise of locks being opened and bars removed, and to see
Mr. Vandeleur, carrying a lantern and clothed in a flowing robe of
black velvet with a skull-cap to match, issue from under the verandah
and proceed leisurely towards the garden gate. The sound of bolts and
bars was then repeated; and a moment after Francis perceived the
Dictator escorting into the house, in the mobile light of the lantern,
an individual of the lowest and most despicable appearance.

Half-an-hour afterwards the visitor was reconducted to the street; and
Mr. Vandeleur, setting his light upon one of the rustic tables,
finished a cigar with great deliberation under the foliage of the
chestnut. Francis, peering through a clear space among the leaves, was
able to follow his gestures as he threw away the ash or enjoyed a
copious inhalation; and beheld a cloud upon the old man’s brow and a
forcible action of the lips, which testified to some deep and probably
painful train of thought. The cigar was already almost at an end, when
the voice of a young girl was heard suddenly crying the hour from the
interior of the house.

“In a moment,” replied John Vandeleur.

And, with that, he threw away the stump and, taking up the lantern,
sailed away under the verandah for the night. As soon as the door was
closed, absolute darkness fell upon the house; Francis might try his
eyesight as much as he pleased, he could not detect so much as a single
chink of light below a blind; and he concluded, with great good sense,
that the bed-chambers were all upon the other side.

Early the next morning (for he was early awake after an uncomfortable
night upon the floor), he saw cause to adopt a different explanation.
The blinds rose, one after another, by means of a spring in the
interior, and disclosed steel shutters such as we see on the front of
shops; these in their turn were rolled up by a similar contrivance; and
for the space of about an hour, the chambers were left open to the
morning air. At the end of that time Mr. Vandeleur, with his own hand,
once more closed the shutters and replaced the blinds from within.

While Francis was still marvelling at these precautions, the door
opened and a young girl came forth to look about her in the garden. It
was not two minutes before she re-entered the house, but even in that
short time he saw enough to convince him that she possessed the most
unusual attractions. His curiosity was not only highly excited by this
incident, but his spirits were improved to a still more notable degree.
The alarming manners and more than equivocal life of his father ceased
from that moment to prey upon his mind; from that moment he embraced
his new family with ardour; and whether the young lady should prove his
sister or his wife, he felt convinced she was an angel in disguise. So
much was this the case that he was seized with a sudden horror when he
reflected how little he really knew, and how possible it was that he
had followed the wrong person when he followed Mr. Vandeleur.

The porter, whom he consulted, could afford him little information;
but, such as it was, it had a mysterious and questionable sound. The
person next door was an English gentleman of extraordinary wealth, and
proportionately eccentric in his tastes and habits. He possessed great
collections, which he kept in the house beside him; and it was to
protect these that he had fitted the place with steel shutters,
elaborate fastenings, and _chevaux-de-frise_ along the garden wall. He
lived much alone, in spite of some strange visitors with whom, it
seemed, he had business to transact; and there was no one else in the
house, except Mademoiselle and an old woman servant.

“Is Mademoiselle his daughter?” inquired Francis.

“Certainly,” replied the porter. “Mademoiselle is the daughter of the
house; and strange it is to see how she is made to work. For all his
riches, it is she who goes to market; and every day in the week you may
see her going by with a basket on her arm.”

“And the collections?” asked the other.

“Sir,” said the man, “they are immensely valuable. More I cannot tell
you. Since M. de Vandeleur’s arrival no one in the quarter has so much
as passed the door.”

“Suppose not,” returned Francis, “you must surely have some notion what
these famous galleries contain. Is it pictures, silks, statues, jewels,
or what?”

“My faith, sir,” said the fellow with a shrug, “it might be carrots,
and still I could not tell you. How should I know? The house is kept
like a garrison, as you perceive.”

And then as Francis was returning disappointed to his room, the porter
called him back.

“I have just remembered, sir,” said he. “M. de Vandeleur has been in
all parts of the world, and I once heard the old woman declare that he
had brought many diamonds back with him. If that be the truth, there
must be a fine show behind those shutters.”

By an early hour on Sunday Francis was in his place at the theatre. The
seat which had been taken for him was only two or three numbers from
the left-hand side, and directly opposite one of the lower boxes. As
the seat had been specially chosen there was doubtless something to be
learned from its position; and he judged by an instinct that the box
upon his right was, in some way or other, to be connected with the
drama in which he ignorantly played a part. Indeed, it was so situated
that its occupants could safely observe him from beginning to end of
the piece, if they were so minded; while, profiting by the depth, they
could screen themselves sufficiently well from any counter-examination
on his side. He promised himself not to leave it for a moment out of
sight; and whilst he scanned the rest of the theatre, or made a show of
attending to the business of the stage, he always kept a corner of an
eye upon the empty box.

The second act had been some time in progress, and was even drawing
towards a close, when the door opened and two persons entered and
ensconced themselves in the darkest of the shade. Francis could hardly
control his emotion. It was Mr. Vandeleur and his daughter. The blood
came and went in his arteries and veins with stunning activity; his
ears sang; his head turned. He dared not look lest he should awake
suspicion; his play-bill, which he kept reading from end to end and
over and over again, turned from white to red before his eyes; and when
he cast a glance upon the stage, it seemed incalculably far away, and
he found the voices and gestures of the actors to the last degree
impertinent and absurd.

From time to time he risked a momentary look in the direction which
principally interested him; and once at least he felt certain that his
eyes encountered those of the young girl. A shock passed over his body,
and he saw all the colours of the rainbow. What would he not have given
to overhear what passed between the Vandeleurs? What would he not have
given for the courage to take up his opera-glass and steadily inspect
their attitude and expression? There, for aught he knew, his whole life
was being decided—and he not able to interfere, not able even to follow
the debate, but condemned to sit and suffer where he was, in impotent
anxiety.

At last the act came to an end. The curtain fell, and the people around
him began to leave their places, for the interval. It was only natural
that he should follow their example; and if he did so, it was not only
natural but necessary that he should pass immediately in front of the
box in question. Summoning all his courage, but keeping his eyes
lowered, Francis drew near the spot. His progress was slow, for the old
gentleman before him moved with incredible deliberation, wheezing as he
went. What was he to do? Should he address the Vandeleurs by name as he
went by? Should he take the flower from his button-hole and throw it
into the box? Should he raise his face and direct one long and
affectionate look upon the lady who was either his sister or his
betrothed? As he found himself thus struggling among so many
alternatives, he had a vision of his old equable existence in the bank,
and was assailed by a thought of regret for the past.

By this time he had arrived directly opposite the box; and although he
was still undetermined what to do or whether to do anything, he turned
his head and lifted his eyes. No sooner had he done so than he uttered
a cry of disappointment and remained rooted to the spot. The box was
empty. During his slow advance Mr. Vandeleur and his daughter had
quietly slipped away.

A polite person in his rear reminded him that he was stopping the path;
and he moved on again with mechanical footsteps, and suffered the crowd
to carry him unresisting out of the theatre. Once in the street, the
pressure ceasing, he came to a halt, and the cool night air speedily
restored him to the possession of his faculties. He was surprised to
find that his head ached violently, and that he remembered not one word
of the two acts which he had witnessed. As the excitement wore away, it
was succeeded by an overweening appetite for sleep, and he hailed a cab
and drove to his lodging in a state of extreme exhaustion and some
disgust of life.

Next morning he lay in wait for Miss Vandeleur on her road to market,
and by eight o’clock beheld her stepping down a lane. She was simply,
and even poorly, attired; but in the carriage of her head and body
there was something flexible and noble that would have lent distinction
to the meanest toilette. Even her basket, so aptly did she carry it,
became her like an ornament. It seemed to Francis, as he slipped into a
doorway, that the sunshine followed and the shadows fled before her as
she walked; and he was conscious, for the first time, of a bird singing
in a cage above the lane.

He suffered her to pass the doorway, and then, coming forth once more,
addressed her by name from behind. “Miss Vandeleur,” said he.

She turned and, when she saw who he was, became deadly pale.

“Pardon me,” he continued; “Heaven knows I had no will to startle you;
and, indeed, there should be nothing startling in the presence of one
who wishes you so well as I do. And, believe me, I am acting rather
from necessity than choice. We have many things in common, and I am
sadly in the dark. There is much that I should be doing, and my hands
are tied. I do not know even what to feel, nor who are my friends and
enemies.”

She found her voice with an effort.

“I do not know who you are,” she said.

“Ah, yes! Miss Vandeleur, you do,” returned Francis “better than I do
myself. Indeed, it is on that, above all, that I seek light. Tell me
what you know,” he pleaded. “Tell me who I am, who you are, and how our
destinies are intermixed. Give me a little help with my life, Miss
Vandeleur—only a word or two to guide me, only the name of my father,
if you will—and I shall be grateful and content.”

“I will not attempt to deceive you,” she replied. “I know who you are,
but I am not at liberty to say.”

“Tell me, at least, that you have forgiven my presumption, and I shall
wait with all the patience I have,” he said. “If I am not to know, I
must do without. It is cruel, but I can bear more upon a push. Only do
not add to my troubles the thought that I have made an enemy of you.”

“You did only what was natural,” she said, “and I have nothing to
forgive you. Farewell.”

“Is it to be _farewell_?” he asked.

“Nay, that I do not know myself,” she answered. “Farewell for the
present, if you like.”

And with these words she was gone.

Francis returned to his lodging in a state of considerable commotion of
mind. He made the most trifling progress with his Euclid for that
forenoon, and was more often at the window than at his improvised
writing-table. But beyond seeing the return of Miss Vandeleur, and the
meeting between her and her father, who was smoking a Trichinopoli
cigar in the verandah, there was nothing notable in the neighbourhood
of the house with the green blinds before the time of the mid-day meal.
The young man hastily allayed his appetite in a neighbouring
restaurant, and returned with the speed of unallayed curiosity to the
house in the Rue Lepic. A mounted servant was leading a saddle-horse to
and fro before the garden wall; and the porter of Francis’s lodging was
smoking a pipe against the door-post, absorbed in contemplation of the
livery and the steeds.

“Look!” he cried to the young man, “what fine cattle! what an elegant
costume! They belong to the brother of M. de Vandeleur, who is now
within upon a visit. He is a great man, a general, in your country; and
you doubtless know him well by reputation.”

“I confess,” returned Francis, “that I have never heard of General
Vandeleur before. We have many officers of that grade, and my pursuits
have been exclusively civil.”

“It is he,” replied the porter, “who lost the great diamond of the
Indies. Of that at least you must have read often in the papers.”

As soon as Francis could disengage himself from the porter he ran
upstairs and hurried to the window. Immediately below the clear space
in the chestnut leaves, the two gentlemen were seated in conversation
over a cigar. The General, a red, military-looking man, offered some
traces of a family resemblance to his brother; he had something of the
same features, something, although very little, of the same free and
powerful carriage; but he was older, smaller, and more common in air;
his likeness was that of a caricature, and he seemed altogether a poor
and debile being by the side of the Dictator.

They spoke in tones so low, leaning over the table with every
appearance of interest, that Francis could catch no more than a word or
two on an occasion. For as little as he heard, he was convinced that
the conversation turned upon himself and his own career; several times
the name of Scrymgeour reached his ear, for it was easy to distinguish,
and still more frequently he fancied he could distinguish the name
Francis.

At length the General, as if in a hot anger, broke forth into several
violent exclamations.

“Francis Vandeleur!” he cried, accentuating the last word. “Francis
Vandeleur, I tell you.”

The Dictator made a movement of his whole body, half affirmative, half
contemptuous, but his answer was inaudible to the young man.

Was he the Francis Vandeleur in question? he wondered. Were they
discussing the name under which he was to be married? Or was the whole
affair a dream and a delusion of his own conceit and self-absorption?

After another interval of inaudible talk, dissension seemed again to
arise between the couple underneath the chestnut, and again the General
raised his voice angrily so as to be audible to Francis.

“My wife?” he cried. “I have done with my wife for good. I will not
hear her name. I am sick of her very name.”

And he swore aloud and beat the table with his fist.

The Dictator appeared, by his gestures, to pacify him after a paternal
fashion; and a little after he conducted him to the garden-gate. The
pair shook hands affectionately enough; but as soon as the door had
closed behind his visitor, John Vandeleur fell into a fit of laughter
which sounded unkindly and even devilish in the ears of Francis
Scrymgeour.

So another day had passed, and little more learnt. But the young man
remembered that the morrow was Tuesday, and promised himself some
curious discoveries; all might be well, or all might be ill; he was
sure, at least, to glean some curious information, and, perhaps, by
good luck, get at the heart of the mystery which surrounded his father
and his family.

As the hour of the dinner drew near many preparations were made in the
garden of the house with the green blinds. That table which was partly
visible to Francis through the chestnut leaves was destined to serve as
a sideboard, and carried relays of plates and the materials for salad:
the other, which was almost entirely concealed, had been set apart for
the diners, and Francis could catch glimpses of white cloth and silver
plate.

Mr. Rolles arrived, punctual to the minute; he looked like a man upon
his guard, and spoke low and sparingly. The Dictator, on the other
hand, appeared to enjoy an unusual flow of spirits; his laugh, which
was youthful and pleasant to hear, sounded frequently from the garden;
by the modulation and the changes of his voice it was obvious that he
told many droll stories and imitated the accents of a variety of
different nations; and before he and the young clergyman had finished
their vermouth all feeling of distrust was at an end, and they were
talking together like a pair of school companions.

At length Miss Vandeleur made her appearance, carrying the soup-tureen.
Mr. Rolles ran to offer her assistance which she laughingly refused;
and there was an interchange of pleasantries among the trio which
seemed to have reference to this primitive manner of waiting by one of
the company.

“One is more at one’s ease,” Mr. Vandeleur was heard to declare.

Next moment they were all three in their places, and Francis could see
as little as he could hear of what passed. But the dinner seemed to go
merrily; there was a perpetual babble of voices and sound of knives and
forks below the chestnut; and Francis, who had no more than a roll to
gnaw, was affected with envy by the comfort and deliberation of the
meal. The party lingered over one dish after another, and then over a
delicate dessert, with a bottle of old wine carefully uncorked by the
hand of the Dictator himself. As it began to grow dark a lamp was set
upon the table and a couple of candles on the sideboard; for the night
was perfectly pure, starry, and windless. Light overflowed besides from
the door and window in the verandah, so that the garden was fairly
illuminated and the leaves twinkled in the darkness.

For perhaps the tenth time Miss Vandeleur entered the house; and on
this occasion she returned with the coffee-tray, which she placed upon
the sideboard. At the same moment her father rose from his seat.

“The coffee is my province,” Francis heard him say.

And next moment he saw his supposed father standing by the sideboard in
the light of the candles.

Talking over his shoulder all the while, Mr. Vandeleur poured out two
cups of the brown stimulant, and then, by a rapid act of
prestidigitation, emptied the contents of a tiny phial into the smaller
of the two. The thing was so swiftly done that even Francis, who looked
straight into his face, had hardly time to perceive the movement before
it was completed. And next instant, and still laughing, Mr. Vandeleur
had turned again towards the table with a cup in either hand.

“Ere we have done with this,” said he, “we may expect our famous
Hebrew.”

It would be impossible to depict the confusion and distress of Francis
Scrymgeour. He saw foul play going forward before his eyes, and he felt
bound to interfere, but knew not how. It might be a mere pleasantry,
and then how should he look if he were to offer an unnecessary warning?
Or again, if it were serious, the criminal might be his own father, and
then how should he not lament if he were to bring ruin on the author of
his days? For the first time he became conscious of his own position as
a spy. To wait inactive at such a juncture and with such a conflict of
sentiments in his bosom was to suffer the most acute torture; he clung
to the bars of the shutters, his heart beat fast and with irregularity,
and he felt a strong sweat break forth upon his body.

Several minutes passed.

He seemed to perceive the conversation die away and grow less and less
in vivacity and volume; but still no sign of any alarming or even
notable event.

Suddenly the ring of a glass breaking was followed by a faint and dull
sound, as of a person who should have fallen forward with his head upon
the table. At the same moment a piercing scream rose from the garden.

“What have you done?” cried Miss Vandeleur. “He is dead!”

The Dictator replied in a violent whisper, so strong and sibilant that
every word was audible to the watcher at the window.

“Silence!” said Mr. Vandeleur; “the man is as well as I am. Take him by
the heels whilst I carry him by the shoulders.”

Francis heard Miss Vandeleur break forth into a passion of tears.

“Do you hear what I say?” resumed the Dictator, in the same tones. “Or
do you wish to quarrel with me? I give you your choice, Miss
Vandeleur.”

There was another pause, and the Dictator spoke again.

“Take that man by the heels,” he said. “I must have him brought into
the house. If I were a little younger, I could help myself against the
world. But now that years and dangers are upon me and my hands are
weakened, I must turn to you for aid.”

“It is a crime,” replied the girl.

“I am your father,” said Mr. Vandeleur.

This appeal seemed to produce its effect. A scuffling noise followed
upon the gravel, a chair was overset, and then Francis saw the father
and daughter stagger across the walk and disappear under the verandah,
bearing the inanimate body of Mr. Rolles embraced about the knees and
shoulders. The young clergyman was limp and pallid, and his head rolled
upon his shoulders at every step.

Was he alive or dead? Francis, in spite of the Dictator’s declaration,
inclined to the latter view. A great crime had been committed; a great
calamity had fallen upon the inhabitants of the house with the green
blinds. To his surprise, Francis found all horror for the deed
swallowed up in sorrow for a girl and an old man whom he judged to be
in the height of peril. A tide of generous feeling swept into his
heart; he, too, would help his father against man and mankind, against
fate and justice; and casting open the shutters he closed his eyes and
threw himself with out-stretched arms into the foliage of the chestnut.

Branch after branch slipped from his grasp or broke under his weight;
then he caught a stalwart bough under his armpit, and hung suspended
for a second; and then he let himself drop and fell heavily against the
table. A cry of alarm from the house warned him that his entrance had
not been effected unobserved. He recovered himself with a stagger, and
in three bounds crossed the intervening space and stood before the door
in the verandah.

In a small apartment, carpeted with matting and surrounded by glazed
cabinets full of rare and costly curios, Mr. Vandeleur was stooping
over the body of Mr. Rolles. He raised himself as Francis entered, and
there was an instantaneous passage of hands. It was the business of a
second; as fast as an eye can wink the thing was done; the young man
had not the time to be sure, but it seemed to him as if the Dictator
had taken something from the curate’s breast, looked at it for the
least fraction of time as it lay in his hand, and then suddenly and
swiftly passed it to his daughter.

All this was over while Francis had still one foot upon the threshold,
and the other raised in air. The next instant he was on his knees to
Mr. Vandeleur.

“Father!” he cried. “Let me too help you. I will do what you wish and
ask no questions; I will obey you with my life; treat me as a son, and
you will find I have a son’s devotion.”

A deplorable explosion of oaths was the Dictator’s first reply.

“Son and father?” he cried. “Father and son? What d—d unnatural comedy
is all this? How do you come in my garden? What do you want? And who,
in God’s name, are you?”

Francis, with a stunned and shamefaced aspect, got upon his feet again,
and stood in silence.

Then a light seemed to break upon Mr. Vandeleur, and he laughed aloud

“I see,” cried he. “It is the Scrymgeour. Very well, Mr. Scrymgeour.
Let me tell you in a few words how you stand. You have entered my
private residence by force, or perhaps by fraud, but certainly with no
encouragement from me; and you come at a moment of some annoyance, a
guest having fainted at my table, to besiege me with your
protestations. You are no son of mine. You are my brother’s bastard by
a fishwife, if you want to know. I regard you with an indifference
closely bordering on aversion; and from what I now see of your conduct,
I judge your mind to be exactly suitable to your exterior. I recommend
you these mortifying reflections for your leisure; and, in the
meantime, let me beseech you to rid us of your presence. If I were not
occupied,” added the Dictator, with a terrifying oath, “I should give
you the unholiest drubbing ere you went!”

Francis listened in profound humiliation. He would have fled had it
been possible; but as he had no means of leaving the residence into
which he had so unfortunately penetrated, he could do no more than
stand foolishly where he was.

It was Miss Vandeleur who broke the silence.

“Father,” she said, “you speak in anger. Mr. Scrymgeour may have been
mistaken, but he meant well and kindly.”

“Thank you for speaking,” returned the Dictator. “You remind me of some
other observations which I hold it a point of honour to make to Mr.
Scrymgeour. My brother,” he continued, addressing the young man, “has
been foolish enough to give you an allowance; he was foolish enough and
presumptuous enough to propose a match between you and this young lady.
You were exhibited to her two nights ago; and I rejoice to tell you
that she rejected the idea with disgust. Let me add that I have
considerable influence with your father; and it shall not be my fault
if you are not beggared of your allowance and sent back to your
scrivening ere the week be out.”

The tones of the old man’s voice were, if possible, more wounding than
his language; Francis felt himself exposed to the most cruel,
blighting, and unbearable contempt; his head turned, and he covered his
face with his hands, uttering at the same time a tearless sob of agony.
But Miss Vandeleur once again interfered in his behalf.

“Mr. Scrymgeour,” she said, speaking in clear and even tones, “you must
not be concerned at my father’s harsh expressions. I felt no disgust
for you; on the contrary, I asked an opportunity to make your better
acquaintance. As for what has passed to-night, believe me it has filled
my mind with both pity and esteem.”

Just then Mr. Rolles made a convulsive movement with his arm, which
convinced Francis that he was only drugged, and was beginning to throw
off the influence of the opiate. Mr. Vandeleur stooped over him and
examined his face for an instant.

“Come, come!” cried he, raising his head. “Let there be an end of this.
And since you are so pleased with his conduct, Miss Vandeleur, take a
candle and show the bastard out.”

The young lady hastened to obey.

“Thank you,” said Francis, as soon as he was alone with her in the
garden. “I thank you from my soul. This has been the bitterest evening
of my life, but it will have always one pleasant recollection.”

“I spoke as I felt,” she replied, “and in justice to you. It made my
heart sorry that you should be so unkindly used.”

By this time they had reached the garden gate; and Miss Vandeleur,
having set the candle on the ground, was already unfastening the bolts.

“One word more,” said Francis. “This is not for the last time—I shall
see you again, shall I not?”

“Alas!” she answered. “You have heard my father. What can I do but
obey?”

“Tell me at least that it is not with your consent,” returned Francis;
“tell me that you have no wish to see the last of me.”

“Indeed,” replied she, “I have none. You seem to me both brave and
honest.”

“Then,” said Francis, “give me a keepsake.”

She paused for a moment, with her hand upon the key; for the various
bars and bolts were all undone, and there was nothing left but to open
the lock.

“If I agree,” she said, “will you promise to do as I tell you from
point to point?”

“Can you ask?” replied Francis. “I would do so willingly on your bare
word.”

She turned the key and threw open the door.

“Be it so,” said she. “You do not know what you ask, but be it so.
Whatever you hear,” she continued, “whatever happens, do not return to
this house; hurry fast until you reach the lighted and populous
quarters of the city; even there be upon your guard. You are in a
greater danger than you fancy. Promise me you will not so much as look
at my keepsake until you are in a place of safety.”

“I promise,” replied Francis.

She put something loosely wrapped in a handkerchief into the young
man’s hand; and at the same time, with more strength than he could have
anticipated, she pushed him into the street.

“Now, run!” she cried.

He heard the door close behind him, and the noise of the bolts being
replaced.

“My faith,” said he, “since I have promised!”

And he took to his heels down the lane that leads into the Rue
Ravignan.

He was not fifty paces from the house with the green blinds when the
most diabolical outcry suddenly arose out of the stillness of the
night. Mechanically he stood still; another passenger followed his
example; in the neighbouring floors he saw people crowding to the
windows; a conflagration could not have produced more disturbance in
this empty quarter. And yet it seemed to be all the work of a single
man, roaring between grief and rage, like a lioness robbed of her
whelps; and Francis was surprised and alarmed to hear his own name
shouted with English imprecations to the wind.

His first movement was to return to the house; his second, as he
remembered Miss Vandeleur’s advice, to continue his flight with greater
expedition than before; and he was in the act of turning to put his
thought in action, when the Dictator, bareheaded, bawling aloud, his
white hair blowing about his head, shot past him like a ball out of the
cannon’s mouth, and went careering down the street.

“That was a close shave,” thought Francis to himself. “What he wants
with me, and why he should be so disturbed, I cannot think; but he is
plainly not good company for the moment, and I cannot do better than
follow Miss Vandeleur’s advice.”

So saying, he turned to retrace his steps, thinking to double and
descend by the Rue Lepic itself while his pursuer should continue to
follow after him on the other line of street. The plan was ill-devised:
as a matter of fact, he should have taken his seat in the nearest café,
and waited there until the first heat of the pursuit was over. But
besides that Francis had no experience and little natural aptitude for
the small war of private life, he was so unconscious of any evil on his
part, that he saw nothing to fear beyond a disagreeable interview. And
to disagreeable interviews he felt he had already served his
apprenticeship that evening; nor could he suppose that Miss Vandeleur
had left anything unsaid. Indeed, the young man was sore both in body
and mind—the one was all bruised, the other was full of smarting
arrows; and he owned to himself that Mr. Vandeleur was master of a very
deadly tongue.

The thought of his bruises reminded him that he had not only come
without a hat, but that his clothes had considerably suffered in his
descent through the chestnut. At the first magazine he purchased a
cheap wideawake, and had the disorder of his toilet summarily repaired.
The keepsake, still rolled in the handkerchief, he thrust in the
meanwhile into his trousers pocket.

Not many steps beyond the shop he was conscious of a sudden shock, a
hand upon his throat, an infuriated face close to his own, and an open
mouth bawling curses in his ear. The Dictator, having found no trace of
his quarry, was returning by the other way. Francis was a stalwart
young fellow; but he was no match for his adversary whether in strength
or skill; and after a few ineffectual struggles he resigned himself
entirely to his captor.

“What do you want with me?” said he.

“We will talk of that at home,” returned the Dictator grimly.

And he continued to march the young man up hill in the direction of the
house with the green blinds.

But Francis, although he no longer struggled, was only waiting an
opportunity to make a bold push for freedom. With a sudden jerk he left
the collar of his coat in the hands of Mr. Vandeleur, and once more
made off at his best speed in the direction of the Boulevards.

The tables were now turned. If the Dictator was the stronger, Francis,
in the top of his youth, was the more fleet of foot, and he had soon
effected his escape among the crowds. Relieved for a moment, but with a
growing sentiment of alarm and wonder in his mind, he walked briskly
until he debouched upon the Place de l’Opéra, lit up like day with
electric lamps.

“This, at least,” thought he, “should satisfy Miss Vandeleur.”

And turning to his right along the Boulevards, he entered the Café
Américain and ordered some beer. It was both late and early for the
majority of the frequenters of the establishment. Only two or three
persons, all men, were dotted here and there at separate tables in the
hall; and Francis was too much occupied by his own thoughts to observe
their presence.

He drew the handkerchief from his pocket. The object wrapped in it
proved to be a morocco case, clasped and ornamented in gilt, which
opened by means of a spring, and disclosed to the horrified young man a
diamond of monstrous bigness and extraordinary brilliancy. The
circumstance was so inexplicable, the value of the stone was plainly so
enormous, that Francis sat staring into the open casket without
movement, without conscious thought, like a man stricken suddenly with
idiocy.

A hand was laid upon his shoulder, lightly but firmly, and a quiet
voice, which yet had in it the ring of command, uttered these words in
his ear—

“Close the casket, and compose your face.”

Looking up, he beheld a man, still young, of an urbane and tranquil
presence, and dressed with rich simplicity. This personage had risen
from a neighbouring table, and, bringing his glass with him, had taken
a seat beside Francis.

“Close the casket,” repeated the stranger, “and put it quietly back
into your pocket, where I feel persuaded it should never have been.
Try, if you please, to throw off your bewildered air, and act as though
I were one of your acquaintances whom you had met by chance. So! Touch
glasses with me. That is better. I fear, sir, you must be an amateur.”

And the stranger pronounced these last words with a smile of peculiar
meaning, leaned back in his seat and enjoyed a deep inhalation of
tobacco.

“For God’s sake,” said Francis, “tell me who you are and what this
means? Why I should obey your most unusual suggestions I am sure I know
not; but the truth is, I have fallen this evening into so many
perplexing adventures, and all I meet conduct themselves so strangely,
that I think I must either have gone mad or wandered into another
planet. Your face inspires me with confidence; you seem wise, good, and
experienced; tell me, for heaven’s sake, why you accost me in so odd a
fashion?”

“All in due time,” replied the stranger. “But I have the first hand,
and you must begin by telling me how the Rajah’s Diamond is in your
possession.”

“The Rajah’s Diamond!” echoed Francis.

“I would not speak so loud, if I were you,” returned the other. “But
most certainly you have the Rajah’s Diamond in your pocket. I have seen
and handled it a score of times in Sir Thomas Vandeleur’s collection.”

“Sir Thomas Vandeleur! The General! My father!” cried Francis.

“Your father?” repeated the stranger. “I was not aware the General had
any family.”

“I am illegitimate, sir,” replied Francis, with a flush.

The other bowed with gravity. It was a respectful bow, as of a man
silently apologising to his equal; and Francis felt relieved and
comforted, he scarce knew why. The society of this person did him good;
he seemed to touch firm ground; a strong feeling of respect grew up in
his bosom, and mechanically he removed his wideawake as though in the
presence of a superior.

“I perceive,” said the stranger, “that your adventures have not all
been peaceful. Your collar is torn, your face is scratched, you have a
cut upon your temple; you will, perhaps, pardon my curiosity when I ask
you to explain how you came by these injuries, and how you happen to
have stolen property to an enormous value in your pocket.”

“I must differ from you!” returned Francis hotly. “I possess no stolen
property. And if you refer to the diamond, it was given to me not an
hour ago by Miss Vandeleur in the Rue Lepic.”

“By Miss Vandeleur of the Rue Lepic!” repeated the other. “You interest
me more than you suppose. Pray continue.”

“Heavens!” cried Francis.

His memory had made a sudden bound. He had seen Mr. Vandeleur take an
article from the breast of his drugged visitor, and that article, he
was now persuaded, was a morocco case.

“You have a light?” inquired the stranger.

“Listen,” replied Francis. “I know not who you are, but I believe you
to be worthy of confidence and helpful; I find myself in strange
waters; I must have counsel and support, and since you invite me I
shall tell you all.”

And he briefly recounted his experiences since the day when he was
summoned from the bank by his lawyer.

“Yours is indeed a remarkable history,” said the stranger, after the
young man had made an end of his narrative; “and your position is full
of difficulty and peril. Many would counsel you to seek out your
father, and give the diamond to him; but I have other views. Waiter!”
he cried.

The waiter drew near.

“Will you ask the manager to speak with me a moment?” said he; and
Francis observed once more, both in his tone and manner, the evidence
of a habit of command.

The waiter withdrew, and returned in a moment with manager, who bowed
with obsequious respect.

“What,” said he, “can I do to serve you?”

“Have the goodness,” replied the stranger, indicating Francis, “to tell
this gentleman my name.”

“You have the honour, sir,” said the functionary, addressing young
Scrymgeour, “to occupy the same table with His Highness Prince Florizel
of Bohemia.”

Francis rose with precipitation, and made a grateful reverence to the
Prince, who bade him resume his seat.

“I thank you,” said Florizel, once more addressing the functionary; “I
am sorry to have deranged you for so small a matter.”

And he dismissed him with a movement of his hand.

“And now,” added the Prince, turning to Francis, “give me the diamond.”

Without a word the casket was handed over.

“You have done right,” said Florizel, “your sentiments have properly
inspired you, and you will live to be grateful for the misfortunes of
to-night. A man, Mr. Scrymgeour, may fall into a thousand perplexities,
but if his heart be upright and his intelligence unclouded, he will
issue from them all without dishonour. Let your mind be at rest; your
affairs are in my hand; and with the aid of heaven I am strong enough
to bring them to a good end. Follow me, if you please, to my carriage.”

So saying the Prince arose and, having left a piece of gold for the
waiter, conducted the young man from the café and along the Boulevard
to where an unpretentious brougham and a couple of servants out of
livery awaited his arrival.

“This carriage,” said he, “is at your disposal; collect your baggage as
rapidly as you can make it convenient, and my servants will conduct you
to a villa in the neighbourhood of Paris where you can wait in some
degree of comfort until I have had time to arrange your situation. You
will find there a pleasant garden, a library of good authors, a cook, a
cellar, and some good cigars, which I recommend to your attention.
Jérome,” he added, turning to one of the servants, “you have heard what
I say; I leave Mr. Scrymgeour in your charge; you will, I know, be
careful of my friend.”

Francis uttered some broken phrases of gratitude.

“It will be time enough to thank me,” said the Prince, “when you are
acknowledged by your father and married to Miss Vandeleur.”

And with that the Prince turned away and strolled leisurely in the
direction of Montmartre. He hailed the first passing cab, gave an
address, and a quarter of an hour afterwards, having discharged the
driver some distance lower, he was knocking at Mr. Vandeleur’s garden
gate.

It was opened with singular precautions by the Dictator in person.

“Who are you?” he demanded.

“You must pardon me this late visit, Mr. Vandeleur,” replied the
Prince.

“Your Highness is always welcome,” returned Mr. Vandeleur, stepping
back.

The Prince profited by the open space, and without waiting for his host
walked right into the house and opened the door of the _salon_. Two
people were seated there; one was Miss Vandeleur, who bore the marks of
weeping about her eyes, and was still shaken from time to time by a
sob; in the other the Prince recognised the young man who had consulted
him on literary matters about a month before, in a club smoking-room.

“Good evening, Miss Vandeleur,” said Florizel; “you look fatigued. Mr.
Rolles, I believe? I hope you have profited by the study of Gaboriau,
Mr. Rolles.”

But the young clergyman’s temper was too much embittered for speech;
and he contented himself with bowing stiffly, and continued to gnaw his
lip.

“To what good wind,” said Mr. Vandeleur, following his guest, “am I to
attribute the honour of your Highness’s presence?”

“I am come on business,” returned the Prince; “on business with you; as
soon as that is settled I shall request Mr. Rolles to accompany me for
a walk. Mr. Rolles,” he added with severity, “let me remind you that I
have not yet sat down.”

The clergyman sprang to his feet with an apology; whereupon the Prince
took an armchair beside the table, handed his hat to Mr. Vandeleur, his
cane to Mr. Rolles, and, leaving them standing and thus menially
employed upon his service, spoke as follows:—

“I have come here, as I said, upon business; but, had I come looking
for pleasure, I could not have been more displeased with my reception
nor more dissatisfied with my company. You, sir,” addressing Mr.
Rolles, “you have treated your superior in station with discourtesy;
you, Vandeleur, receive me with a smile, but you know right well that
your hands are not yet cleansed from misconduct. I do not desire to be
interrupted, sir,” he added imperiously; “I am here to speak, and not
to listen; and I have to ask you to hear me with respect, and to obey
punctiliously. At the earliest possible date your daughter shall be
married at the Embassy to my friend, Francis Scrymgeour, your brother’s
acknowledged son. You will oblige me by offering not less than ten
thousand pounds dowry. For yourself, I will indicate to you in writing
a mission of some importance in Siam which I destine to your care. And
now, sir, you will answer me in two words whether or not you agree to
these conditions.”

“Your Highness will pardon me,” said Mr. Vandeleur, “and permit me,
with all respect, to submit to him two queries?”

“The permission is granted,” replied the Prince.

“Your Highness,” resumed the Dictator, “has called Mr. Scrymgeour his
friend. Believe me, had I known he was thus honoured, I should have
treated him with proportional respect.”

“You interrogate adroitly,” said the Prince; “but it will not serve
your turn. You have my commands; if I had never seen that gentleman
before to-night, it would not render them less absolute.”

“Your Highness interprets my meaning with his usual subtlety,” returned
Vandeleur. “Once more: I have, unfortunately, put the police upon the
track of Mr. Scrymgeour on a charge of theft; am I to withdraw or to
uphold the accusation?”

“You will please yourself,” replied Florizel. “The question is one
between your conscience and the laws of this land. Give me my hat; and
you, Mr. Rolles, give me my cane and follow me. Miss Vandeleur, I wish
you good evening. I judge,” he added to Vandeleur, “that your silence
means unqualified assent.”

“If I can do no better,” replied the old man, “I shall submit; but I
warn you openly it shall not be without a struggle.”

“You are old,” said the Prince; “but years are disgraceful to the
wicked. Your age is more unwise than the youth of others. Do not
provoke me, or you may find me harder than you dream. This is the first
time that I have fallen across your path in anger; take care that it be
the last.”

With these words, motioning the clergyman to follow, Florizel left the
apartment and directed his steps towards the garden gate; and the
Dictator, following with a candle, gave them light, and once more undid
the elaborate fastenings with which he sought to protect himself from
intrusion.

“Your daughter is no longer present,” said the Prince, turning on the
threshold. “Let me tell you that I understand your threats; and you
have only to lift your hand to bring upon yourself sudden and
irremediable ruin.”

The Dictator made no reply; but as the Prince turned his back upon him
in the lamplight he made a gesture full of menace and insane fury; and
the next moment, slipping round a corner, he was running at full speed
for the nearest cab-stand.


(_Here_, says my Arabian, _the thread of events is finally diverted
from_ The House with the Green Blinds. _One more adventure_, he adds,
_and we have done with_ The Rajah’s Diamond. _That last link in the
chain is known among the inhabitants of Bagdad by the name of_ The
Adventure of Prince Florizel and a Detective.)




THE ADVENTURE OF PRINCE FLORIZEL AND A DETECTIVE


Prince Florizel walked with Mr. Rolles to the door of a small hotel
where the latter resided. They spoke much together, and the clergyman
was more than once affected to tears by the mingled severity and
tenderness of Florizel’s reproaches.

“I have made ruin of my life,” he said at last. “Help me; tell me what
I am to do; I have, alas! neither the virtues of a priest nor the
dexterity of a rogue.”

“Now that you are humbled,” said the Prince, “I command no longer; the
repentant have to do with God and not with princes. But if you will let
me advise you, go to Australia as a colonist, seek menial labour in the
open air, and try to forget that you have ever been a clergyman, or
that you ever set eyes on that accursed stone.”

“Accurst indeed!” replied Mr. Rolles. “Where is it now? What further
hurt is it not working for mankind?”

“It will do no more evil,” returned the Prince. “It is here in my
pocket. And this,” he added kindly, “will show that I place some faith
in your penitence, young as it is.”

“Suffer me to touch your hand,” pleaded Mr. Rolles.

“No,” replied Prince Florizel, “not yet.”

The tone in which he uttered these last words was eloquent in the ears
of the young clergyman; and for some minutes after the Prince had
turned away he stood on the threshold following with his eyes the
retreating figure and invoking the blessing of heaven upon a man so
excellent in counsel.

For several hours the Prince walked alone in unfrequented streets. His
mind was full of concern; what to do with the diamond, whether to
return it to its owner, whom he judged unworthy of this rare
possession, or to take some sweeping and courageous measure and put it
out of the reach of all mankind at once and for ever, was a problem too
grave to be decided in a moment. The manner in which it had come into
his hands appeared manifestly providential; and as he took out the
jewel and looked at it under the street lamps, its size and surprising
brilliancy inclined him more and more to think of it as of an unmixed
and dangerous evil for the world.

“God help me!” he thought; “if I look at it much oftener, I shall begin
to grow covetous myself.”

At last, though still uncertain in his mind, he turned his steps
towards the small but elegant mansion on the river-side which had
belonged for centuries to his royal family. The arms of Bohemia are
deeply graved over the door and upon the tall chimneys; passengers have
a look into a green court set with the most costly flowers, and a
stork, the only one in Paris, perches on the gable all day long and
keeps a crowd before the house. Grave servants are seen passing to and
fro within; and from time to time the great gate is thrown open and a
carriage rolls below the arch. For many reasons this residence was
especially dear to the heart of Prince Florizel; he never drew near to
it without enjoying that sentiment of home-coming so rare in the lives
of the great; and on the present evening he beheld its tall roof and
mildly illuminated windows with unfeigned relief and satisfaction.

As he was approaching the postern door by which he always entered when
alone, a man stepped forth from the shadow and presented himself with
an obeisance in the Prince’s path.

“I have the honour of addressing Prince Florizel of Bohemia?” said he.

“Such is my title,” replied the Prince. “What do you want with me?”

“I am,” said the man, “a detective, and I have to present your Highness
with this billet from the Prefect of Police.”

The Prince took the letter and glanced it through by the light of the
street lamp. It was highly apologetic, but requested him to follow the
bearer to the Prefecture without delay.

“In short,” said Florizel, “I am arrested.”

“Your Highness,” replied the officer, “nothing, I am certain, could be
further from the intention of the Prefect. You will observe that he has
not granted a warrant. It is mere formality, or call it, if you prefer,
an obligation that your Highness lays on the authorities.”

“At the same time,” asked the Prince, “if I were to refuse to follow
you?”

“I will not conceal from your Highness that a considerable discretion
has been granted me,” replied the detective with a bow.

“Upon my word,” cried Florizel, “your effrontery astounds me! Yourself,
as an agent, I must pardon; but your superiors shall dearly smart for
their misconduct. What, have you any idea, is the cause of this
impolitic and unconstitutional act? You will observe that I have as yet
neither refused nor consented, and much may depend on your prompt and
ingenuous answer. Let me remind you, officer, that this is an affair of
some gravity.”

“Your Highness,” said the detective humbly, “General Vandeleur and his
brother have had the incredible presumption to accuse you of theft. The
famous diamond, they declare, is in your hands. A word from you in
denial will most amply satisfy the Prefect; nay, I go farther: if your
Highness would so far honour a subaltern as to declare his ignorance of
the matter even to myself, I should ask permission to retire upon the
spot.”

Florizel, up to the last moment, had regarded his adventure in the
light of a trifle, only serious upon international considerations. At
the name of Vandeleur the horrible truth broke upon him in a moment; he
was not only arrested, but he was guilty. This was not only an annoying
incident—it was a peril to his honour. What was he to say? What was he
to do? The Rajah’s Diamond was indeed an accursed stone; and it seemed
as if he were to be the last victim to its influence.

One thing was certain. He could not give the required assurance to the
detective. He must gain time.

His hesitation had not lasted a second.

“Be it so,” said he, “let us walk together to the Prefecture.”

The man once more bowed, and proceeded to follow Florizel at a
respectful distance in the rear.

“Approach,” said the Prince. “I am in a humour to talk, and, if I
mistake not, now I look at you again, this is not the first time that
we have met.”

“I count it an honour,” replied the officer, “that your Highness should
recollect my face. It is eight years since I had the pleasure of an
interview.”

“To remember faces,” returned Florizel, “is as much a part of my
profession as it is of yours. Indeed, rightly looked upon, a Prince and
a detective serve in the same corps. We are both combatants against
crime; only mine is the more lucrative and yours the more dangerous
rank, and there is a sense in which both may be made equally honourable
to a good man. I had rather, strange as you may think it, be a
detective of character and parts than a weak and ignoble sovereign.”

The officer was overwhelmed.

“Your Highness returns good for evil,” said he. “To an act of
presumption he replies by the most amiable condescension.”

“How do you know,” replied Florizel, “that I am not seeking to corrupt
you?”

“Heaven preserve me from the temptation!” cried the detective.

“I applaud your answer,” returned the Prince. “It is that of a wise and
honest man. The world is a great place and stocked with wealth and
beauty, and there is no limit to the rewards that may be offered. Such
an one who would refuse a million of money may sell his honour for an
empire or the love of a woman; and I myself, who speak to you, have
seen occasions so tempting, provocations so irresistible to the
strength of human virtue, that I have been glad to tread in your steps
and recommend myself to the grace of God. It is thus, thanks to that
modest and becoming habit alone,” he added, “that you and I can walk
this town together with untarnished hearts.”

“I had always heard that you were brave,” replied the officer, “but I
was not aware that you were wise and pious. You speak the truth, and
you speak it with an accent that moves me to the heart. This world is
indeed a place of trial.”

“We are now,” said Florizel, “in the middle of the bridge. Lean your
elbows on the parapet and look over. As the water rushing below, so the
passions and complications of life carry away the honesty of weak men.
Let me tell you a story.”

“I receive your Highness’s commands,” replied the man.

And, imitating the Prince, he leaned against the parapet, and disposed
himself to listen. The city was already sunk in slumber; had it not
been for the infinity of lights and the outline of buildings on the
starry sky, they might have been alone beside some country river.

“An officer,” began Prince Florizel, “a man of courage and conduct, who
had already risen by merit to an eminent rank, and won not only
admiration but respect, visited, in an unfortunate hour for his peace
of mind, the collections of an Indian Prince. Here he beheld a diamond
so extraordinary for size and beauty that from that instant he had only
one desire in life: honour, reputation, friendship, the love of
country, he was ready to sacrifice all for this lump of sparkling
crystal. For three years he served this semi-barbarian potentate as
Jacob served Laban; he falsified frontiers, he connived at murders, he
unjustly condemned and executed a brother-officer who had the
misfortune to displease the Rajah by some honest freedoms; lastly, at a
time of great danger to his native land, he betrayed a body of his
fellow-soldiers, and suffered them to be defeated and massacred by
thousands. In the end, he had amassed a magnificent fortune, and
brought home with him the coveted diamond.

“Years passed,” continued the Prince, “and at length the diamond is
accidentally lost. It falls into the hands of a simple and laborious
youth, a student, a minister of God, just entering on a career of
usefulness and even distinction. Upon him also the spell is cast; he
deserts everything, his holy calling, his studies, and flees with the
gem into a foreign country. The officer has a brother, an astute,
daring, unscrupulous man, who learns the clergyman’s secret. What does
he do? Tell his brother, inform the police? No; upon this man also the
Satanic charm has fallen; he must have the stone for himself. At the
risk of murder, he drugs the young priest and seizes the prey. And now,
by an accident which is not important to my moral, the jewel passes out
of his custody into that of another, who, terrified at what he sees,
gives it into the keeping of a man in high station and above reproach.

“The officer’s name is Thomas Vandeleur,” continued Florizel. “The
stone is called the Rajah’s Diamond. And”—suddenly opening his
hand—“you behold it here before your eyes.”

The officer started back with a cry.

“We have spoken of corruption,” said the Prince. “To me this nugget of
bright crystal is as loathsome as though it were crawling with the
worms of death; it is as shocking as though it were compacted out of
innocent blood. I see it here in my hand, and I know it is shining with
hell-fire. I have told you but a hundredth part of its story; what
passed in former ages, to what crimes and treacheries it incited men of
yore, the imagination trembles to conceive; for years and years it has
faithfully served the powers of hell; enough, I say, of blood, enough
of disgrace, enough of broken lives and friendships; all things come to
an end, the evil like the good; pestilence as well as beautiful music;
and as for this diamond, God forgive me if I do wrong, but its empire
ends to-night.”

The Prince made a sudden movement with his hand, and the jewel,
describing an arc of light, dived with a splash into the flowing river.

“Amen,” said Florizel with gravity. “I have slain a cockatrice!”

“God pardon me!” cried the detective. “What have you done? I am a
ruined man.”

“I think,” returned the Prince with a smile, “that many well-to-do
people in this city might envy you your ruin.”

“Alas! your Highness!” said the officer, “and you corrupt me after
all?”

“It seems there was no help for it,” replied Florizel. “And now let us
go forward to the Prefecture.”


Not long after, the marriage of Francis Scrymgeour and Miss Vandeleur
was celebrated in great privacy; and the Prince acted on that occasion
as groomsman. The two Vandeleurs surprised some rumour of what had
happened to the diamond; and their vast diving operations on the River
Seine are the wonder and amusement of the idle. It is true that through
some miscalculation they have chosen the wrong branch of the river. As
for the Prince, that sublime person, having now served his turn, may
go, along with the _Arabian Author_, topsy-turvy into space. But if the
reader insists on more specific information, I am happy to say that a
recent revolution hurled him from the throne of Bohemia, in consequence
of his continued absence and edifying neglect of public business; and
that his Highness now keeps a cigar store in Rupert Street, much
frequented by other foreign refugees. I go there from time to time to
smoke and have a chat, and find him as great a creature as in the days
of his prosperity; he has an Olympian air behind the counter; and
although a sedentary life is beginning to tell upon his waistcoat, he
is probably, take him for all in all, the handsomest tobacconist in
London.




THE PAVILION ON THE LINKS




CHAPTER I
TELLS HOW I CAMPED IN GRADEN SEA-WOOD, AND BEHELD A LIGHT IN THE
PAVILION


I was a great solitary when I was young. I made it my pride to keep
aloof and suffice for my own entertainment; and I may say that I had
neither friends nor acquaintances until I met that friend who became my
wife and the mother of my children. With one man only was I on private
terms; this was R. Northmour, Esquire, of Graden Easter, in Scotland.
We had met at college; and though there was not much liking between us,
nor even much intimacy, we were so nearly of a humour that we could
associate with ease to both. Misanthropes, we believed ourselves to be;
but I have thought since that we were only sulky fellows. It was
scarcely a companionship, but a coexistence in unsociability.
Northmour’s exceptional violence of temper made it no easy affair for
him to keep the peace with any one but me; and as he respected my
silent ways, and let me come and go as I pleased, I could tolerate his
presence without concern. I think we called each other friends.

When Northmour took his degree and I decided to leave the university
without one, he invited me on a long visit to Graden Easter; and it was
thus that I first became acquainted with the scene of my adventures.
The mansion-house of Graden stood in a bleak stretch of country some
three miles from the shore of the German Ocean. It was as large as a
barrack; and as it had been built of a soft stone, liable to consume in
the eager air of the seaside, it was damp and draughty within and half
ruinous without. It was impossible for two young men to lodge with
comfort in such a dwelling. But there stood in the northern part of the
estate, in a wilderness of links and blowing sand-hills, and between a
plantation and the sea, a small Pavilion or Belvidere, of modern
design, which was exactly suited to our wants; and in this hermitage,
speaking little, reading much, and rarely associating except at meals,
Northmour and I spent four tempestuous winter months. I might have
stayed longer; but one March night there sprang up between us a
dispute, which rendered my departure necessary. Northmour spoke hotly,
I remember, and I suppose I must have made some tart rejoinder. He
leaped from his chair and grappled me; I had to fight, without
exaggeration, for my life; and it was only with a great effort that I
mastered him, for he was near as strong in body as myself, and seemed
filled with the devil. The next morning, we met on our usual terms; but
I judged it more delicate to withdraw; nor did he attempt to dissuade
me.

It was nine years before I revisited the neighbourhood. I travelled at
that time with a tilt cart, a tent, and a cooking-stove, tramping all
day beside the waggon, and at night, whenever it was possible, gipsying
in a cove of the hills, or by the side of a wood. I believe I visited
in this manner most of the wild and desolate regions both in England
and Scotland; and, as I had neither friends nor relations, I was
troubled with no correspondence, and had nothing in the nature of
headquarters, unless it was the office of my solicitors, from whom I
drew my income twice a year. It was a life in which I delighted; and I
fully thought to have grown old upon the march, and at last died in a
ditch.

It was my whole business to find desolate corners, where I could camp
without the fear of interruption; and hence, being in another part of
the same shire, I bethought me suddenly of the Pavilion on the Links.
No thoroughfare passed within three miles of it. The nearest town, and
that was but a fisher village, was at a distance of six or seven. For
ten miles of length, and from a depth varying from three miles to half
a mile, this belt of barren country lay along the sea. The beach, which
was the natural approach, was full of quicksands. Indeed I may say
there is hardly a better place of concealment in the United Kingdom. I
determined to pass a week in the Sea-Wood of Graden Easter, and making
a long stage, reached it about sundown on a wild September day.

The country, I have said, was mixed sand-hill and links; _links_ being
a Scottish name for sand which has ceased drifting and become more or
less solidly covered with turf. The Pavilion stood on an even space; a
little behind it, the wood began in a hedge of elders huddled together
by the wind; in front, a few tumbled sand-hills stood between it and
the sea. An outcropping of rock had formed a bastion for the sand, so
that there was here a promontory in the coast-line between two shallow
bays; and just beyond the tides, the rock again cropped out and formed
an islet of small dimensions but strikingly designed. The quicksands
were of great extent at low water, and had an infamous reputation in
the country. Close in shore, between the islet and the promontory, it
was said they would swallow a man in four minutes and a half; but there
may have been little ground for this precision. The district was alive
with rabbits, and haunted by gulls which made a continual piping about
the pavilion. On summer days the outlook was bright and even gladsome;
but at sundown in September, with a high wind, and a heavy surf rolling
in close along the links, the place told of nothing but dead mariners
and sea disaster. A ship beating to windward on the horizon, and a huge
truncheon of wreck half buried in the sands at my feet, completed the
innuendo of the scene.

The pavilion—it had been built by the last proprietor, Northmour’s
uncle, a silly and prodigal virtuoso—presented little signs of age. It
was two storeys in height, Italian in design, surrounded by a patch of
garden in which nothing had prospered but a few coarse flowers; and
looked, with its shuttered windows, not like a house that had been
deserted, but like one that had never been tenanted by man. Northmour
was plainly from home; whether, as usual, sulking in the cabin of his
yacht, or in one of his fitful and extravagant appearances in the world
of society, I had, of course, no means of guessing. The place had an
air of solitude that daunted even a solitary like myself; the wind
cried in the chimneys with a strange and wailing note; and it was with
a sense of escape, as if I were going indoors, that I turned away and,
driving my cart before me, entered the skirts of the wood.

The Sea-Wood of Graden had been planted to shelter the cultivated
fields behind, and check the encroachments of the blowing sand. As you
advanced into it from coastward, elders were succeeded by other hardy
shrubs; but the timber was all stunted and bushy; it led a life of
conflict; the trees were accustomed to swing there all night long in
fierce winter tempests; and even in early spring, the leaves were
already flying, and autumn was beginning, in this exposed plantation.
Inland the ground rose into a little hill, which, along with the islet,
served as a sailing mark for seamen. When the hill was open of the
islet to the north, vessels must bear well to the eastward to clear
Graden Ness and the Graden Bullers. In the lower ground, a streamlet
ran among the trees, and, being dammed with dead leaves and clay of its
own carrying, spread out every here and there, and lay in stagnant
pools. One or two ruined cottages were dotted about the wood; and,
according to Northmour, these were ecclesiastical foundations, and in
their time had sheltered pious hermits.

I found a den, or small hollow, where there was a spring of pure water;
and there, clearing away the brambles, I pitched the tent, and made a
fire to cook my supper. My horse I picketed farther in the wood where
there was a patch of sward. The banks of the den not only concealed the
light of my fire, but sheltered me from the wind, which was cold as
well as high.

The life I was leading made me both hardy and frugal. I never drank but
water, and rarely ate anything more costly than oatmeal; and I required
so little sleep, that, although I rose with the peep of day, I would
often lie long awake in the dark or starry watches of the night. Thus
in Graden Sea-Wood, although I fell thankfully asleep by eight in the
evening I was awake again before eleven with a full possession of my
faculties, and no sense of drowsiness or fatigue. I rose and sat by the
fire, watching the trees and clouds tumultuously tossing and fleeing
overhead, and hearkening to the wind and the rollers along the shore;
till at length, growing weary of inaction, I quitted the den, and
strolled towards the borders of the wood. A young moon, buried in mist,
gave a faint illumination to my steps; and the light grew brighter as I
walked forth into the links. At the same moment, the wind, smelling
salt of the open ocean and carrying particles of sand, struck me with
its full force, so that I had to bow my head.

When I raised it again to look about me, I was aware of a light in the
pavilion. It was not stationary; but passed from one window to another,
as though some one were reviewing the different apartments with a lamp
or candle.

I watched it for some seconds in great surprise. When I had arrived in
the afternoon the house had been plainly deserted; now it was as
plainly occupied. It was my first idea that a gang of thieves might
have broken in and be now ransacking Northmour’s cupboards, which were
many and not ill supplied. But what should bring thieves to Graden
Easter? And, again, all the shutters had been thrown open, and it would
have been more in the character of such gentry to close them. I
dismissed the notion, and fell back upon another. Northmour himself
must have arrived, and was now airing and inspecting the pavilion.

I have said that there was no real affection between this man and me;
but, had I loved him like a brother, I was then so much more in love
with solitude that I should none the less have shunned his company. As
it was, I turned and ran for it; and it was with genuine satisfaction
that I found myself safely back beside the fire. I had escaped an
acquaintance; I should have one more night in comfort. In the morning,
I might either slip away before Northmour was abroad, or pay him as
short a visit as I chose.

But when morning came, I thought the situation so diverting that I
forgot my shyness. Northmour was at my mercy; I arranged a good
practical jest, though I knew well that my neighbour was not the man to
jest with in security; and, chuckling beforehand over its success, took
my place among the elders at the edge of the wood, whence I could
command the door of the pavilion. The shutters were all once more
closed, which I remember thinking odd; and the house, with its white
walls and green venetians, looked spruce and habitable in the morning
light. Hour after hour passed, and still no sign of Northmour. I knew
him for a sluggard in the morning; but, as it drew on towards noon, I
lost my patience. To say the truth, I had promised myself to break my
fast in the pavilion, and hunger began to prick me sharply. It was a
pity to let the opportunity go by without some cause for mirth; but the
grosser appetite prevailed, and I relinquished my jest with regret, and
sallied from the wood.

The appearance of the house affected me, as I drew near, with
disquietude. It seemed unchanged since last evening; and I had expected
it, I scarce knew why, to wear some external signs of habitation. But
no: the windows were all closely shuttered, the chimneys breathed no
smoke, and the front door itself was closely padlocked. Northmour,
therefore, had entered by the back; this was the natural and, indeed,
the necessary conclusion; and you may judge of my surprise when, on
turning the house, I found the back door similarly secured.

My mind at once reverted to the original theory of thieves; and I
blamed myself sharply for my last night’s inaction. I examined all the
windows on the lower storey, but none of them had been tampered with; I
tried the padlocks, but they were both secure. It thus became a problem
how the thieves, if thieves they were, had managed to enter the house.
They must have got, I reasoned, upon the roof of the outhouse where
Northmour used to keep his photographic battery; and from thence,
either by the window of the study or that of my old bedroom, completed
their burglarious entry.

I followed what I supposed was their example; and, getting on the roof,
tried the shutters of each room. Both were secure; but I was not to be
beaten; and, with a little force, one of them flew open, grazing, as it
did so, the back of my hand. I remember, I put the wound to my mouth,
and stood for perhaps half a minute licking it like a dog, and
mechanically gazing behind me over the waste links and the sea; and, in
that space of time, my eye made note of a large schooner yacht some
miles to the north-east. Then I threw up the window and climbed in.

I went over the house, and nothing can express my mystification. There
was no sign of disorder, but, on the contrary, the rooms were unusually
clean and pleasant. I found fires laid, ready for lighting; three
bedrooms prepared with a luxury quite foreign to Northmour’s habits,
and with water in the ewers and the beds turned down; a table set for
three in the dining-room; and an ample supply of cold meats, game, and
vegetables on the pantry shelves. There were guests expected, that was
plain; but why guests, when Northmour hated society? And, above all,
why was the house thus stealthily prepared at dead of night? and why
were the shutters closed and the doors padlocked?

I effaced all traces of my visit, and came forth from the window
feeling sobered and concerned.

The schooner yacht was still in the same place; and it flashed for a
moment through my mind that this might be the _Red Earl_ bringing the
owner of the pavilion and his guests. But the vessel’s head was set the
other way.




CHAPTER II
TELLS OF THE NOCTURNAL LANDING FROM THE YACHT


I returned to the den to cook myself a meal, of which I stood in great
need, as well as to care for my horse, whom I had somewhat neglected in
the morning. From time to time I went down to the edge of the wood; but
there was no change in the pavilion, and not a human creature was seen
all day upon the links. The schooner in the offing was the one touch of
life within my range of vision. She, apparently with no set object,
stood off and on or lay to, hour after hour; but as the evening
deepened, she drew steadily nearer. I became more convinced that she
carried Northmour and his friends, and that they would probably come
ashore after dark; not only because that was of a piece with the
secrecy of the preparations, but because the tide would not have flowed
sufficiently before eleven to cover Graden Floe and the other sea quags
that fortified the shore against invaders.

All day the wind had been going down, and the sea along with it; but
there was a return towards sunset of the heavy weather of the day
before. The night set in pitch dark. The wind came off the sea in
squalls, like the firing of a battery of cannon; now and then there was
a flaw of rain, and the surf rolled heavier with the rising tide. I was
down at my observatory among the elders, when a light was run up to the
masthead of the schooner, and showed she was closer in than when I had
last seen her by the dying daylight. I concluded that this must be a
signal to Northmour’s associates on shore; and, stepping forth into the
links, looked around me for something in response.

A small footpath ran along the margin of the wood, and formed the most
direct communication between the pavilion and the mansion-house; and,
as I cast my eyes to that side, I saw a spark of light, not a quarter
of a mile away, and rapidly approaching. From its uneven course it
appeared to be the light of a lantern carried by a person who followed
the windings of the path, and was often staggered and taken aback by
the more violent squalls. I concealed myself once more among the
elders, and waited eagerly for the new-comer’s advance. It proved to be
a woman; and, as she passed within half a rod of my ambush, I was able
to recognise the features. The deaf and silent old dame, who had nursed
Northmour in his childhood, was his associate in this underhand affair.

I followed her at a little distance, taking advantage of the
innumerable heights and hollows, concealed by the darkness, and
favoured not only by the nurse’s deafness, but by the uproar of the
wind and surf. She entered the pavilion, and, going at once to the
upper storey, opened and set a light in one of the windows that looked
towards the sea. Immediately afterwards the light at the schooner’s
masthead was run down and extinguished. Its purpose had been attained,
and those on board were sure that they were expected. The old woman
resumed her preparations; although the other shutters remained closed,
I could see a glimmer going to and fro about the house; and a gush of
sparks from one chimney after another soon told me that the fires were
being kindled.

Northmour and his guests, I was now persuaded, would come ashore as
soon as there was water on the floe. It was a wild night for boat
service; and I felt some alarm mingle with my curiosity as I reflected
on the danger of the landing. My old acquaintance, it was true, was the
most eccentric of men; but the present eccentricity was both
disquieting and lugubrious to consider. A variety of feelings thus led
me towards the beach, where I lay flat on my face in a hollow within
six feet of the track that led to the pavilion. Thence, I should have
the satisfaction of recognising the arrivals, and, if they should prove
to be acquaintances, greeting them as soon as they had landed.

Some time before eleven, while the tide was still dangerously low, a
boat’s lantern appeared close in shore; and, my attention being thus
awakened, I could perceive another still far to seaward, violently
tossed, and sometimes hidden by the billows. The weather, which was
getting dirtier as the night went on, and the perilous situation of the
yacht upon a lee shore, had probably driven them to attempt a landing
at the earliest possible moment.

A little afterwards, four yachtsmen carrying a very heavy chest, and
guided by a fifth with a lantern, passed close in front of me as I lay,
and were admitted to the pavilion by the nurse. They returned to the
beach, and passed me a second time with another chest, larger but
apparently not so heavy as the first. A third time they made the
transit; and on this occasion one of the yachtsmen carried a leather
portmanteau, and the others a lady’s trunk and carriage bag. My
curiosity was sharply excited. If a woman were among the guests of
Northmour, it would show a change in his habits and an apostasy from
his pet theories of life, well calculated to fill me with surprise.
When he and I dwelt there together, the pavilion had been a temple of
misogyny. And now, one of the detested sex was to be installed under
its roof. I remembered one or two particulars, a few notes of
daintiness and almost of coquetry which had struck me the day before as
I surveyed the preparations in the house; their purpose was now clear,
and I thought myself dull not to have perceived it from the first.

While I was thus reflecting, a second lantern drew near me from the
beach. It was carried by a yachtsman whom I had not yet seen, and who
was conducting two other persons to the pavilion. These two persons
were unquestionably the guests for whom the house was made ready; and,
straining eye and ear, I set myself to watch them as they passed. One
was an unusually tall man, in a travelling hat slouched over his eyes,
and a highland cape closely buttoned and turned up so as to conceal his
face. You could make out no more of him than that he was, as I have
said, unusually tall, and walked feebly with a heavy stoop. By his
side, and either clinging to him or giving him support—I could not make
out which—was a young, tall, and slender figure of a woman. She was
extremely pale; but in the light of the lantern her face was so marred
by strong and changing shadows, that she might equally well have been
as ugly as sin or as beautiful as I afterwards found her to be.

When they were just abreast of me, the girl made some remark which was
drowned by the noise of the wind.

“Hush!” said her companion; and there was something in the tone with
which the word was uttered that thrilled and rather shook my spirits.
It seemed to breathe from a bosom labouring under the deadliest terror;
I have never heard another syllable so expressive; and I still hear it
again when I am feverish at night, and my mind runs upon old times. The
man turned towards the girl as he spoke; I had a glimpse of much red
beard and a nose which seemed to have been broken in youth; and his
light eyes seemed shining in his face with some strong and unpleasant
emotion.

But these two passed on and were admitted in their turn to the
pavilion.

One by one, or in groups, the seamen returned to the beach. The wind
brought me the sound of a rough voice crying, “Shove off!” Then, after
a pause, another lantern drew near. It was Northmour alone.

My wife and I, a man and a woman, have often agreed to wonder how a
person could be, at the same time, so handsome and so repulsive as
Northmour. He had the appearance of a finished gentleman; his face bore
every mark of intelligence and courage; but you had only to look at
him, even in his most amiable moment, to see that he had the temper of
a slaver captain. I never knew a character that was both explosive and
revengeful to the same degree; he combined the vivacity of the south
with the sustained and deadly hatreds of the north; and both traits
were plainly written on his face, which was a sort of danger signal. In
person he was tall, strong, and active; his hair and complexion very
dark; his features handsomely designed, but spoiled by a menacing
expression.

At that moment he was somewhat paler than by nature; he wore a heavy
frown; and his lips worked, and he looked sharply round him as he
walked, like a man besieged with apprehensions. And yet I thought he
had a look of triumph underlying all, as though he had already done
much, and was near the end of an achievement.

Partly from a scruple of delicacy—which I dare say came too late—partly
from the pleasure of startling an acquaintance, I desired to make my
presence known to him without delay.

I got suddenly to my feet, and stepped forward. “Northmour!” said I.

I have never had so shocking a surprise in all my days. He leaped on me
without a word; something shone in his hand; and he struck for my heart
with a dagger. At the same moment I knocked him head over heels.
Whether it was my quickness, or his own uncertainty, I know not; but
the blade only grazed my shoulder, while the hilt and his fist struck
me violently on the mouth.

I fled, but not far. I had often and often observed the capabilities of
the sand-hills for protracted ambush or stealthy advances and retreats;
and, not ten yards from the scene of the scuffle, plumped down again
upon the grass. The lantern had fallen and gone out. But what was my
astonishment to see Northmour slip at a bound into the pavilion, and
hear him bar the door behind him with a clang of iron!

He had not pursued me. He had run away. Northmour, whom I knew for the
most implacable and daring of men, had run away! I could scarce believe
my reason; and yet in this strange business, where all was incredible,
there was nothing to make a work about in an incredibility more or
less. For why was the pavilion secretly prepared? Why had Northmour
landed with his guests at dead of night, in half a gale of wind, and
with the floe scarce covered? Why had he sought to kill me? Had he not
recognised my voice? I wondered. And, above all, how had he come to
have a dagger ready in his hand? A dagger, or even a sharp knife,
seemed out of keeping with the age in which we lived; and a gentleman
landing from his yacht on the shore of his own estate, even although it
was at night and with some mysterious circumstances, does not usually,
as a matter of fact, walk thus prepared for deadly onslaught. The more
I reflected, the further I felt at sea. I recapitulated the elements of
mystery, counting them on my fingers: the pavilion secretly prepared
for guests; the guests landed at the risk of their lives and to the
imminent peril of the yacht; the guests, or at least one of them, in
undisguised and seemingly causeless terror; Northmour with a naked
weapon; Northmour stabbing his most intimate acquaintance at a word;
last, and not least strange, Northmour fleeing from the man whom he had
sought to murder, and barricading himself, like a hunted creature,
behind the door of the pavilion. Here were at least six separate causes
for extreme surprise; each part and parcel with the others, and forming
all together one consistent story. I felt almost ashamed to believe my
own senses.

As I thus stood, transfixed with wonder, I began to grow painfully
conscious of the injuries I had received in the scuffle; skulked round
among the sand-hills; and, by a devious path, regained the shelter of
the wood. On the way, the old nurse passed again within several yards
of me, still carrying her lantern, on the return journey to the
mansion-house of Graden. This made a seventh suspicious feature in the
case—Northmour and his guests, it appeared, were to cook and do the
cleaning for themselves, while the old woman continued to inhabit the
big empty barrack among the policies. There must surely be great cause
for secrecy, when so many inconveniences were confronted to preserve
it.

So thinking, I made my way to the den. For greater security, I trod out
the embers of the fire, and lit my lantern to examine the wound upon my
shoulder. It was a trifling hurt, although it bled somewhat freely, and
I dressed it as well as I could (for its position made it difficult to
reach) with some rag and cold water from the spring. While I was thus
busied, I mentally declared war against Northmour and his mystery. I am
not an angry man by nature, and I believe there was more curiosity than
resentment in my heart. But war I certainly declared; and, by way of
preparation, I got out my revolver, and, having drawn the charges,
cleaned and reloaded it with scrupulous care. Next I became preoccupied
about my horse. It might break loose, or fall to neighing, and so
betray my camp in the Sea-Wood. I determined to rid myself of its
neighbourhood; and long before dawn I was leading it over the links in
the direction of the fisher village.




CHAPTER III
TELLS HOW I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MY WIFE


For two days I skulked round the pavilion, profiting by the uneven
surface of the links. I became an adept in the necessary tactics. These
low hillocks and shallow dells, running one into another, became a kind
of cloak of darkness for my enthralling, but perhaps dishonourable,
pursuit. Yet, in spite of this advantage, I could learn but little of
Northmour or his guests.

Fresh provisions were brought under cover of darkness by the old woman
from the mansion-house. Northmour, and the young lady, sometimes
together, but more often singly, would walk for an hour or two at a
time on the beach beside the quicksand. I could not but conclude that
this promenade was chosen with an eye to secrecy; for the spot was open
only to the seaward. But it suited me not less excellently; the highest
and most accidented of the sand-hills immediately adjoined; and from
these, lying flat in a hollow, I could overlook Northmour or the young
lady as they walked.

The tall man seemed to have disappeared. Not only did he never cross
the threshold, but he never so much as showed face at a window; or, at
least, not so far as I could see; for I dared not creep forward beyond
a certain distance in the day, since the upper floor commanded the
bottoms of the links; and at night, when I could venture farther, the
lower windows were barricaded as if to stand a siege. Sometimes I
thought the tall man must be confined to bed, for I remembered the
feebleness of his gait; and sometimes I thought he must have gone clear
away, and that Northmour and the young lady remained alone together in
the pavilion. The idea, even then, displeased me.

Whether or not this pair were man and wife, I had seen abundant reason
to doubt the friendliness of their relation. Although I could hear
nothing of what they said, and rarely so much as glean a decided
expression on the face of either, there was a distance, almost a
stiffness, in their bearing which showed them to be either unfamiliar
or at enmity. The girl walked faster when she was with Northmour than
when she was alone; and I conceived that any inclination between a man
and a woman would rather delay than accelerate the step. Moreover, she
kept a good yard free of him, and trailed her umbrella, as if it were a
barrier, on the side between them. Northmour kept sidling closer; and,
as the girl retired from his advance, their course lay at a sort of
diagonal across the beach, and would have landed them in the surf had
it been long enough continued. But, when this was imminent, the girl
would unostentatiously change sides and put Northmour between her and
the sea. I watched these manœuvres, for my part, with high enjoyment
and approval, and chuckled to myself at every move.

On the morning of the third day, she walked alone for some time, and I
perceived, to my great concern, that she was more than once in tears.
You will see that my heart was already interested more than I supposed.
She had a firm yet airy motion of the body, and carried her head with
unimaginable grace; every step was a thing to look at, and she seemed
in my eyes to breathe sweetness and distinction.

The day was so agreeable, being calm and sunshiny, with a tranquil sea,
and yet with a healthful piquancy and vigour in the air, that, contrary
to custom, she was tempted forth a second time to walk. On this
occasion she was accompanied by Northmour, and they had been but a
short while on the beach, when I saw him take forcible possession of
her hand. She struggled, and uttered a cry that was almost a scream. I
sprang to my feet, unmindful of my strange position; but, ere I had
taken a step, I saw Northmour bareheaded and bowing very low, as if to
apologise; and dropped again at once into my ambush. A few words were
interchanged; and then, with another bow, he left the beach to return
to the pavilion. He passed not far from me, and I could see him,
flushed and lowering, and cutting savagely with his cane among the
grass. It was not without satisfaction that I recognised my own
handiwork in a great cut under his right eye, and a considerable
discolouration round the socket.

For some time the girl remained where he had left her, looking out past
the islet and over the bright sea. Then with a start, as one who throws
off preoccupation and puts energy again upon its mettle, she broke into
a rapid and decisive walk. She also was much incensed by what had
passed. She had forgotten where she was. And I beheld her walk straight
into the borders of the quicksand where it is most abrupt and
dangerous. Two or three steps farther and her life would have been in
serious jeopardy, when I slid down the face of the sand-hill, which is
there precipitous, and, running half-way forward, called to her to
stop.

She did so, and turned round. There was not a tremor of fear in her
behaviour, and she marched directly up to me like a queen. I was
barefoot, and clad like a common sailor, save for an Egyptian scarf
round my waist; and she probably took me at first for some one from the
fisher village, straying after bait. As for her, when I thus saw her
face to face, her eyes set steadily and imperiously upon mine, I was
filled with admiration and astonishment, and thought her even more
beautiful than I had looked to find her. Nor could I think enough of
one who, acting with so much boldness, yet preserved a maidenly air
that was both quaint and engaging; for my wife kept an old-fashioned
precision of manner through all her admirable life—an excellent thing
in woman, since it sets another value on her sweet familiarities.

“What does this mean?” she asked.

“You were walking,” I told her, “directly into Graden Floe.”

“You do not belong to these parts,” she said again. “You speak like an
educated man.”

“I believe I have right to that name,” said I, “although in this
disguise.”

But her woman’s eye had already detected the sash. “Oh!” she said;
“your sash betrays you.”

“You have said the word _betray_,” I resumed. “May I ask you not to
betray me? I was obliged to disclose myself in your interest; but if
Northmour learned my presence it might be worse than disagreeable for
me.”

“Do you know,” she asked, “to whom you are speaking?”

“Not to Mr. Northmour’s wife?” I asked, by way of answer.

She shook her head. All this while she was studying my face with an
embarrassing intentness. Then she broke out—

“You have an honest face. Be honest like your face, sir, and tell me
what you want and what you are afraid of. Do you think I could hurt
you? I believe you have far more power to injure me! And yet you do not
look unkind. What do you mean—you, a gentleman—by skulking like a spy
about this desolate place? Tell me,” she said, “who is it you hate?”

“I hate no one,” I answered; “and I fear no one face to face. My name
is Cassilis—Frank Cassilis. I lead the life of a vagabond for my own
good pleasure. I am one of Northmour’s oldest friends; and three nights
ago, when I addressed him on these links, he stabbed me in the shoulder
with a knife.”

“It was you!” she said.

“Why he did so,” I continued, disregarding the interruption, “is more
than I can guess, and more than I care to know. I have not many
friends, nor am I very susceptible to friendship; but no man shall
drive me from a place by terror. I had camped in Graden Sea-Wood ere he
came; I camp in it still. If you think I mean harm to you or yours,
madam, the remedy is in your hand. Tell him that my camp is in the
Hemlock Den, and to-night he can stab me in safety while I sleep.”

With this I doffed my cap to her, and scrambled up once more among the
sand-hills. I do not know why, but I felt a prodigious sense of
injustice, and felt like a hero and a martyr; while, as a matter of
fact, I had not a word to say in my defence, nor so much as one
plausible reason to offer for my conduct. I had stayed at Graden out of
a curiosity natural enough, but undignified; and though there was
another motive growing in along with the first, it was not one which,
at that period, I could have properly explained to the lady of my
heart.

Certainly, that night, I thought of no one else; and, though her whole
conduct and position seemed suspicious, I could not find it in my heart
to entertain a doubt of her integrity. I could have staked my life that
she was clear of blame, and, though all was dark at the present, that
the explanation of the mystery would show her part in these events to
be both right and needful. It was true, let me cudgel my imagination as
I pleased, that I could invent no theory of her relations to Northmour;
but I felt none the less sure of my conclusion because it was founded
on instinct in place of reason, and, as I may say, went to sleep that
night with the thought of her under my pillow.

Next day she came out about the same hour alone, and, as soon as the
sand-hills concealed her from the pavilion, drew nearer to the edge,
and called me by name in guarded tones. I was astonished to observe
that she was deadly pale, and seemingly under the influence of strong
emotion.

“Mr. Cassilis!” she cried; “Mr. Cassilis!”

I appeared at once, and leaped down upon the beach. A remarkable air of
relief overspread her countenance as soon as she saw me.

“Oh!” she cried, with a hoarse sound, like one whose bosom has been
lightened of a weight. And then, “Thank God you are still safe!” she
added; “I knew, if you were, you would be here.” (Was not this strange?
So swiftly and wisely does Nature prepare our hearts for these great
life-long intimacies, that both my wife and I had been given a
presentiment on this the second day of our acquaintance. I had even
then hoped that she would seek me; she had felt sure that she would
find me.) “Do not,” she went, on swiftly, “do not stay in this place.
Promise me that you will sleep no longer in that wood. You do not know
how I suffer; all last night I could not sleep for thinking of your
peril.”

“Peril?” I repeated. “Peril from whom? From Northmour?”

“Not so,” she said. “Did you think I would tell him after what you
said?”

“Not from Northmour?” I repeated. “Then how? From whom? I see none to
be afraid of.”

“You must not ask me,” was her reply, “for I am not free to tell you.
Only believe me, and go hence—believe me, and go away quickly, quickly,
for your life!”

An appeal to his alarm is never a good plan to rid oneself of a
spirited young man. My obstinacy was but increased by what she said,
and I made it a point of honour to remain. And her solicitude for my
safety still more confirmed me in the resolve.

“You must not think me inquisitive, madam,” I replied; “but, if Graden
is so dangerous a place, you yourself perhaps remain here at some
risk.”

She only looked at me reproachfully.

“You and your father—” I resumed; but she interrupted me almost with a
gasp.

“My father! How do you know that?” she cried.

“I saw you together when you landed,” was my answer; and I do not know
why, but it seemed satisfactory to both of us, as indeed it was the
truth. “But,” I continued, “you need have no fear from me. I see you
have some reason to be secret, and, you may believe me, your secret is
as safe with me as if I were in Graden Floe. I have scarce spoken to
any one for years; my horse is my only companion, and even he, poor
beast, is not beside me. You see, then, you may count on me for
silence. So tell me the truth, my dear young lady, are you not in
danger?”

“Mr. Northmour says you are an honourable man,” she returned, “and I
believe it when I see you. I will tell you so much; you are right; we
are in dreadful, dreadful danger, and you share it by remaining where
you are.”

“Ah!” said I; “you have heard of me from Northmour? And he gives me a
good character?”

“I asked him about you last night,” was her reply. “I pretended,” she
hesitated, “I pretended to have met you long ago, and spoken to you of
him. It was not true; but I could not help myself without betraying
you, and you had put me in a difficulty. He praised you highly.”

“And—you may permit me one question—does this danger come from
Northmour?” I asked.

“From Mr. Northmour?” she cried. “Oh no; he stays with us to share it.”

“While you propose that I should run away?” I said. “You do not rate me
very high.”

“Why should you stay?” she asked. “You are no friend of ours.”

I know not what came over me, for I had not been conscious of a similar
weakness since I was a child, but I was so mortified by this retort
that my eyes pricked and filled with tears, as I continued to gaze upon
her face.

“No, no,” she said, in a changed voice; “I did not mean the words
unkindly.”

“It was I who offended,” I said; and I held out my hand with a look of
appeal that somehow touched her, for she gave me hers at once, and even
eagerly. I held it for awhile in mine, and gazed into her eyes. It was
she who first tore her hand away, and, forgetting all about her request
and the promise she had sought to extort, ran at the top of her speed,
and without turning, till she was out of sight.

And then I knew that I loved her, and thought in my glad heart that
she—she herself—was not indifferent to my suit. Many a time she has
denied it in after days, but it was with a smiling and not a serious
denial. For my part, I am sure our hands would not have lain so closely
in each other if she had not begun to melt to me already. And, when all
is said, it is no great contention, since, by her own avowal, she began
to love me on the morrow.

And yet on the morrow very little took place. She came and called me
down as on the day before, upbraided me for lingering at Graden, and,
when she found I was still obdurate, began to ask me more particularly
as to my arrival. I told her by what series of accidents I had come to
witness their disembarkation, and how I had determined to remain,
partly from the interest which had been wakened in me by Northmour’s
guests, and partly because of his own murderous attack. As to the
former, I fear I was disingenuous, and led her to regard herself as
having been an attraction to me from the first moment that I saw her on
the links. It relieves my heart to make this confession even now, when
my wife is with God, and already knows all things, and the honesty of
my purpose even in this; for while she lived, although it often pricked
my conscience, I had never the hardihood to undeceive her. Even a
little secret, in such a married life as ours, is like the rose-leaf
which kept the Princess from her sleep.

From this the talk branched into other subjects, and I told her much
about my lonely and wandering existence; she, for her part, giving ear,
and saying little. Although we spoke very naturally, and latterly on
topics that might seem indifferent, we were both sweetly agitated. Too
soon it was time for her to go; and we separated, as if by mutual
consent, without shaking hands, for both knew that, between us, it was
no idle ceremony.

The next, and that was the fourth day of our acquaintance, we met in
the same spot, but early in the morning, with much familiarity and yet
much timidity on either side. When she had once more spoken about my
danger—and that, I understood, was her excuse for coming—I, who had
prepared a great deal of talk during the night, began to tell her how
highly I valued her kind interest, and how no one had ever cared to
hear about my life, nor had I ever cared to relate it, before
yesterday. Suddenly she interrupted me, saying with vehemence—

“And yet, if you knew who I was, you would not so much as speak to me!”

I told her such a thought was madness, and, little as we had met, I
counted her already a dear friend; but my protestations seemed only to
make her more desperate.

“My father is in hiding!” she cried.

“My dear,” I said, forgetting for the first time to add “young lady,”
“what do I care? If he were in hiding twenty times over, would it make
one thought of change in you?”

“Ah, but the cause!” she cried, “the cause! It is—” she faltered for a
second—“it is disgraceful to us!”




CHAPTER IV
TELLS IN WHAT A STARTLING MANNER I LEARNED THAT I WAS NOT ALONE IN
GRADEN SEA-WOOD


This was my wife’s story, as I drew it from her among tears and sobs.
Her name was Clara Huddlestone: it sounded very beautiful in my ears;
but not so beautiful as that other name of Clara Cassilis, which she
wore during the longer and, I thank God, the happier portion of her
life. Her father, Bernard Huddlestone, had been a private banker in a
very large way of business. Many years before, his affairs becoming
disordered, he had been led to try dangerous, and at last criminal,
expedients to retrieve himself from ruin. All was in vain; he became
more and more cruelly involved, and found his honour lost at the same
moment with his fortune. About this period, Northmour had been courting
his daughter with great assiduity, though with small encouragement; and
to him, knowing him thus disposed in his favour, Bernard Huddlestone
turned for help in his extremity. It was not merely ruin and dishonour,
nor merely a legal condemnation, that the unhappy man had brought upon
his head. It seems he could have gone to prison with a light heart.
What he feared, what kept him awake at night or recalled him from
slumber into frenzy, was some secret, sudden, and unlawful attempt upon
his life. Hence, he desired to bury his existence and escape to one of
the islands in the South Pacific, and it was in Northmour’s yacht, the
_Red Earl_, that he designed to go. The yacht picked them up
clandestinely upon the coast of Wales, and had once more deposited them
at Graden, till she could be refitted and provisioned for the longer
voyage. Nor could Clara doubt that her hand had been stipulated as the
price of passage. For, although Northmour was neither unkind nor even
discourteous, he had shown himself in several instances somewhat
overbold in speech and manner.

I listened, I need not say, with fixed attention, and put many
questions as to the more mysterious part. It was in vain. She had no
clear idea of what the blow was, nor of how it was expected to fall.
Her father’s alarm was unfeigned and physically prostrating, and he had
thought more than once of making an unconditional surrender to the
police. But the scheme was finally abandoned, for he was convinced that
not even the strength of our English prisons could shelter him from his
pursuers. He had had many affairs with Italy, and with Italians
resident in London, in the later years of his business; and these last,
as Clara fancied, were somehow connected with the doom that threatened
him. He had shown great terror at the presence of an Italian seaman on
board the _Red Earl_, and had bitterly and repeatedly accused Northmour
in consequence. The latter had protested that Beppo (that was the
seaman’s name) was a capital fellow, and could be trusted to the death;
but Mr. Huddlestone had continued ever since to declare that all was
lost, that it was only a question of days, and that Beppo would be the
ruin of him yet.

I regarded the whole story as the hallucination of a mind shaken by
calamity. He had suffered heavy loss by his Italian transactions; and
hence the sight of an Italian was hateful to him, and the principal
part in his nightmare would naturally enough be played by one of that
nation.

“What your father wants,” I said, “is a good doctor and some calming
medicine.”

“But Mr. Northmour?” objected your mother. “He is untroubled by losses,
and yet he shares in this terror.”

I could not help laughing at what I considered her simplicity.

“My dear,” said I, “you have told me yourself what reward he has to
look for. All is fair in love, you must remember; and if Northmour
foments your father’s terrors, it is not at all because he is afraid of
any Italian man, but simply because he is infatuated with a charming
English woman.”

She reminded me of his attack upon myself on the night of the
disembarkation, and this I was unable to explain. In short, and from
one thing to another, it was agreed between us, that I should set out
at once for the fisher village, Graden Wester, as it was called, look
up all the newspapers I could find, and see for myself if there seemed
any basis of fact for these continued alarms. The next morning, at the
same hour and place, I was to make my report to Clara. She said no more
on that occasion about my departure; nor, indeed, did she make it a
secret that she clung to the thought of my proximity as something
helpful and pleasant; and, for my part, I could not have left her, if
she had gone upon her knees to ask it.

I reached Graden Wester before ten in the forenoon; for in those days I
was an excellent pedestrian, and the distance, as I think I have said,
was little over seven miles; fine walking all the way upon the springy
turf. The village is one of the bleakest on that coast, which is saying
much: there is a church in a hollow; a miserable haven in the rocks,
where many boats have been lost as they returned from fishing; two or
three score of stone houses arranged along the beach and in two
streets, one leading from the harbour, and another striking out from it
at right angles; and, at the corner of these two, a very dark and
cheerless tavern, by way of principal hotel.

I had dressed myself somewhat more suitably to my station in life, and
at once called upon the minister in his little manse beside the
graveyard. He knew me, although it was more than nine years since we
had met; and when I told him that I had been long upon a walking tour,
and was behind with the news, readily lent me an armful of newspapers,
dating from a month back to the day before. With these I sought the
tavern, and, ordering some breakfast, sat down to study the
“Huddlestone Failure.”

It had been, it appeared, a very flagrant case. Thousands of persons
were reduced to poverty; and one in particular had blown out his brains
as soon as payment was suspended. It was strange to myself that, while
I read these details, I continued rather to sympathise with Mr.
Huddlestone than with his victims; so complete already was the empire
of my love for my wife. A price was naturally set upon the banker’s
head; and, as the case was inexcusable and the public indignation
thoroughly aroused, the unusual figure of £750 was offered for his
capture. He was reported to have large sums of money in his possession.
One day, he had been heard of in Spain; the next, there was sure
intelligence that he was still lurking between Manchester and
Liverpool, or along the border of Wales; and the day after, a telegram
would announce his arrival in Cuba or Yucatan. But in all this there
was no word of an Italian, nor any sign of mystery.

In the very last paper, however, there was one item not so clear. The
accountants who were charged to verify the failure had, it seemed, come
upon the traces of a very large number of thousands, which figured for
some time in the transactions of the house of Huddlestone; but which
came from nowhere, and disappeared in the same mysterious fashion. It
was only once referred to by name, and then under the initials “X. X.”;
but it had plainly been floated for the first time into the business at
a period of great depression some six years ago. The name of a
distinguished Royal personage had been mentioned by rumour in
connection with this sum. “The cowardly desperado”—such, I remember,
was the editorial expression—was supposed to have escaped with a large
part of this mysterious fund still in his possession.

I was still brooding over the fact, and trying to torture it into some
connection with Mr. Huddlestone’s danger, when a man entered the tavern
and asked for some bread and cheese with a decided foreign accent.

“_Siete Italiano_?” said I.

“_Sì_, _signor_,” was his reply.

I said it was unusually far north to find one of his compatriots; at
which he shrugged his shoulders, and replied that a man would go
anywhere to find work. What work he could hope to find at Graden
Wester, I was totally unable to conceive; and the incident struck so
unpleasantly upon my mind, that I asked the landlord, while he was
counting me some change, whether he had ever before seen an Italian in
the village. He said he had once seen some Norwegians, who had been
shipwrecked on the other side of Graden Ness and rescued by the
lifeboat from Cauldhaven.

“No!” said I; “but an Italian, like the man who has just had bread and
cheese.”

“What?” cried he, “yon black-avised fellow wi’ the teeth? Was he an
I-talian? Weel, yon’s the first that ever I saw, an’ I dare say he’s
like to be the last.”

Even as he was speaking, I raised my eyes, and, casting a glance into
the street, beheld three men in earnest conversation together, and not
thirty yards away. One of them was my recent companion in the tavern
parlour; the other two, by their handsome, sallow features and soft
hats, should evidently belong to the same race. A crowd of village
children stood around them, gesticulating and talking gibberish in
imitation. The trio looked singularly foreign to the bleak dirty street
in which they were standing, and the dark grey heaven that overspread
them; and I confess my incredulity received at that moment a shock from
which it never recovered. I might reason with myself as I pleased, but
I could not argue down the effect of what I had seen, and I began to
share in the Italian terror.

It was already drawing towards the close of the day before I had
returned the newspapers at the manse, and got well forward on to the
links on my way home. I shall never forget that walk. It grew very cold
and boisterous; the wind sang in the short grass about my feet; thin
rain showers came running on the gusts; and an immense mountain range
of clouds began to arise out of the bosom of the sea. It would be hard
to imagine a more dismal evening; and whether it was from these
external influences, or because my nerves were already affected by what
I had heard and seen, my thoughts were as gloomy as the weather.

The upper windows of the pavilion commanded a considerable spread of
links in the direction of Graden Wester. To avoid observation, it was
necessary to hug the beach until I had gained cover from the higher
sand-hills on the little headland, when I might strike across, through
the hollows, for the margin of the wood. The sun was about setting; the
tide was low, and all the quicksands uncovered; and I was moving along,
lost in unpleasant thought, when I was suddenly thunderstruck to
perceive the prints of human feet. They ran parallel to my own course,
but low down upon the beach instead of along the border of the turf;
and, when I examined them, I saw at once, by the size and coarseness of
the impression, that it was a stranger to me and to those in the
pavilion who had recently passed that way. Not only so; but from the
recklessness of the course which he had followed, steering near to the
most formidable portions of the sand, he was as evidently a stranger to
the country and to the ill-repute of Graden beach.

Step by step I followed the prints; until, a quarter of a mile farther,
I beheld them die away into the south-eastern boundary of Graden Floe.
There, whoever he was, the miserable man had perished. One or two
gulls, who had, perhaps, seen him disappear, wheeled over his sepulchre
with their usual melancholy piping. The sun had broken through the
clouds by a last effort, and coloured the wide level of quicksands with
a dusky purple. I stood for some time gazing at the spot, chilled and
disheartened by my own reflections, and with a strong and commanding
consciousness of death. I remember wondering how long the tragedy had
taken, and whether his screams had been audible at the pavilion. And
then, making a strong resolution, I was about to tear myself away, when
a gust fiercer than usual fell upon this quarter of the beach, and I
saw now, whirling high in air, now skimming lightly across the surface
of the sands, a soft, black, felt hat, somewhat conical in shape, such
as I had remarked already on the heads of the Italians.

I believe, but I am not sure, that I uttered a cry. The wind was
driving the hat shoreward, and I ran round the border of the floe to be
ready against its arrival. The gust fell, dropping the hat for a while
upon the quicksand, and then, once more freshening, landed it a few
yards from where I stood. I seized it with the interest you may
imagine. It had seen some service; indeed, it was rustier than either
of those I had seen that day upon the street. The lining was red,
stamped with the name of the maker, which I have forgotten, and that of
the place of manufacture, _Venedig_. This (it is not yet forgotten) was
the name given by the Austrians to the beautiful city of Venice, then,
and for long after, a part of their dominions.

The shock was complete. I saw imaginary Italians upon every side; and
for the first, and, I may say, for the last time in my experience,
became overpowered by what is called a panic terror. I knew nothing,
that is, to be afraid of, and yet I admit that I was heartily afraid;
and it was with a sensible reluctance that I returned to my exposed and
solitary camp in the Sea-Wood.

There I ate some cold porridge which had been left over from the night
before, for I was disinclined to make a fire; and, feeling strengthened
and reassured, dismissed all these fanciful terrors from my mind, and
lay down to sleep with composure.

How long I may have slept it is impossible for me to guess; but I was
awakened at last by a sudden, blinding flash of light into my face. It
woke me like a blow. In an instant I was upon my knees. But the light
had gone as suddenly as it came. The darkness was intense. And, as it
was blowing great guns from the sea and pouring with rain, the noises
of the storm effectually concealed all others.

It was, I dare say, half a minute before I regained my self-possession.
But for two circumstances, I should have thought I had been awakened by
some new and vivid form of nightmare. First, the flap of my tent, which
I had shut carefully when I retired, was now unfastened; and, second, I
could still perceive, with a sharpness that excluded any theory of
hallucination, the smell of hot metal and of burning oil. The
conclusion was obvious. I had been wakened by some one flashing a
bull’s-eye lantern in my face. It had been but a flash, and away. He
had seen my face, and then gone. I asked myself the object of so
strange a proceeding, and the answer came pat. The man, whoever he was,
had thought to recognise me, and he had not. There was yet another
question unresolved; and to this, I may say, I feared to give an
answer; if he had recognised me, what would he have done?

My fears were immediately diverted from myself, for I saw that I had
been visited in a mistake; and I became persuaded that some dreadful
danger threatened the pavilion. It required some nerve to issue forth
into the black and intricate thicket which surrounded and overhung the
den; but I groped my way to the links, drenched with rain, beaten upon
and deafened by the gusts, and fearing at every step to lay my hand
upon some lurking adversary. The darkness was so complete that I might
have been surrounded by an army and yet none the wiser, and the uproar
of the gale so loud that my hearing was as useless as my sight.

For the rest of that night, which seemed interminably long, I patrolled
the vicinity of the pavilion, without seeing a living creature or
hearing any noise but the concert of the wind, the sea, and the rain. A
light in the upper story filtered through a cranny of the shutter, and
kept me company till the approach of dawn.




CHAPTER V
TELLS OF AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN NORTHMOUR, CLARA, AND MYSELF


With the first peep of day, I retired from the open to my old lair
among the sand-hills, there to await the coming of my wife. The morning
was grey, wild, and melancholy; the wind moderated before sunrise, and
then went about, and blew in puffs from the shore; the sea began to go
down, but the rain still fell without mercy. Over all the wilderness of
links there was not a creature to be seen. Yet I felt sure the
neighbourhood was alive with skulking foes. The light that had been so
suddenly and surprisingly flashed upon my face as I lay sleeping, and
the hat that had been blown ashore by the wind from over Graden Floe,
were two speaking signals of the peril that environed Clara and the
party in the pavilion.

It was, perhaps, half-past seven, or nearer eight, before I saw the
door open, and that dear figure come towards me in the rain. I was
waiting for her on the beach before she had crossed the sand-hills.

“I have had such trouble to come!” she cried. “They did not wish me to
go walking in the rain.”

“Clara,” I said, “you are not frightened!”

“No,” said she, with a simplicity that filled my heart with confidence.
For my wife was the bravest as well as the best of women; in my
experience, I have not found the two go always together, but with her
they did; and she combined the extreme of fortitude with the most
endearing and beautiful virtues.

I told her what had happened; and, though her cheek grew visibly paler,
she retained perfect control over her senses.

“You see now that I am safe,” said I, in conclusion. “They do not mean
to harm me; for, had they chosen, I was a dead man last night.”

She laid her hand upon my arm.

“And I had no presentiment!” she cried.

Her accent thrilled me with delight. I put my arm about her, and
strained her to my side; and, before either of us was aware, her hands
were on my shoulders and my lips upon her mouth. Yet up to that moment
no word of love had passed between us. To this day I remember the touch
of her cheek, which was wet and cold with the rain; and many a time
since, when she has been washing her face, I have kissed it again for
the sake of that morning on the beach. Now that she is taken from me,
and I finish my pilgrimage alone, I recall our old lovingkindnesses and
the deep honesty and affection which united us, and my present loss
seems but a trifle in comparison.

We may have thus stood for some seconds—for time passes quickly with
lovers—before we were startled by a peal of laughter close at hand. It
was not natural mirth, but seemed to be affected in order to conceal an
angrier feeling. We both turned, though I still kept my left arm about
Clara’s waist; nor did she seek to withdraw herself; and there, a few
paces off upon the beach, stood Northmour, his head lowered, his hands
behind his back, his nostrils white with passion.

“Ah! Cassilis!” he said, as I disclosed my face.

“That same,” said I; for I was not at all put about.

“And so, Miss Huddlestone,” he continued slowly but savagely, “this is
how you keep your faith to your father and to me? This is the value you
set upon your father’s life? And you are so infatuated with this young
gentleman that you must brave ruin, and decency, and common human
caution—”

“Miss Huddlestone—” I was beginning to interrupt him, when he, in his
turn, cut in brutally—

“You hold your tongue,” said he; “I am speaking to that girl.”

“That girl, as you call her, is my wife,” said I; and my wife only
leaned a little nearer, so that I knew she had affirmed my words.

“Your what?” he cried. “You lie!”

“Northmour,” I said, “we all know you have a bad temper, and I am the
last man to be irritated by words. For all that, I propose that you
speak lower, for I am convinced that we are not alone.”

He looked round him, and it was plain my remark had in some degree
sobered his passion. “What do you mean?” he asked.

I only said one word: “Italians.”

He swore a round oath, and looked at us, from one to the other.

“Mr. Cassilis knows all that I know,” said my wife.

“What I want to know,” he broke out, “is where the devil Mr. Cassilis
comes from, and what the devil Mr. Cassilis is doing here. You say you
are married; that I do not believe. If you were, Graden Floe would soon
divorce you; four minutes and a half, Cassilis. I keep my private
cemetery for my friends.”

“It took somewhat longer,” said I, “for that Italian.”

He looked at me for a moment half daunted, and then, almost civilly,
asked me to tell my story. “You have too much the advantage of me,
Cassilis,” he added. I complied of course; and he listened, with
several ejaculations, while I told him how I had come to Graden: that
it was I whom he had tried to murder on the night of landing; and what
I had subsequently seen and heard of the Italians.

“Well,” said he, when I had done, “it is here at last; there is no
mistake about that. And what, may I ask, do you propose to do?”

“I propose to stay with you and lend a hand,” said I.

“You are a brave man,” he returned, with a peculiar intonation.

“I am not afraid,” said I.

“And so,” he continued, “I am to understand that you two are married?
And you stand up to it before my face, Miss Huddlestone?”

“We are not yet married,” said Clara; “but we shall be as soon as we
can.”

“Bravo!” cried Northmour. “And the bargain? D—n it, you’re not a fool,
young woman; I may call a spade a spade with you. How about the
bargain? You know as well as I do what your father’s life depends upon.
I have only to put my hands under my coat-tails and walk away, and his
throat would he cut before the evening.”

“Yes, Mr. Northmour,” returned Clara, with great spirit; “but that is
what you will never do. You made a bargain that was unworthy of a
gentleman; but you are a gentleman for all that, and you will never
desert a man whom you have begun to help.”

“Aha!” said he. “You think I will give my yacht for nothing? You think
I will risk my life and liberty for love of the old gentleman; and
then, I suppose, be best man at the wedding, to wind up? Well,” he
added, with an odd smile, “perhaps you are not altogether wrong. But
ask Cassilis here. _He_ knows me. Am I a man to trust? Am I safe and
scrupulous? Am I kind?”

“I know you talk a great deal, and sometimes, I think, very foolishly,”
replied Clara, “but I know you are a gentleman, and I am not the least
afraid.”

He looked at her with a peculiar approval and admiration; then, turning
to me, “Do you think I would give her up without a struggle, Frank?”
said he. “I tell you plainly, you look out. The next time we come to
blows—”

“Will make the third,” I interrupted, smiling.

“Aye, true; so it will,” he said. “I had forgotten. Well, the third
time’s lucky.”

“The third time, you mean, you will have the crew of the _Red Earl_ to
help,” I said.

“Do you hear him?” he asked, turning to my wife.

“I hear two men speaking like cowards,” said she. “I should despise
myself either to think or speak like that. And neither of you believe
one word that you are saying, which makes it the more wicked and
silly.”

“She’s a trump!” cried Northmour. “But she’s not yet Mrs. Cassilis. I
say no more. The present is not for me.” Then my wife surprised me.

“I leave you here,” she said suddenly. “My father has been too long
alone. But remember this: you are to be friends, for you are both good
friends to me.”

She has since told me her reason for this step. As long as she
remained, she declares that we two would have continued to quarrel; and
I suppose that she was right, for when she was gone we fell at once
into a sort of confidentiality.

Northmour stared after her as she went away over the sand-hill

“She is the only woman in the world!” he exclaimed with an oath. “Look
at her action.”

I, for my part, leaped at this opportunity for a little further light.

“See here, Northmour,” said I; “we are all in a tight place, are we
not?”

“I believe you, my boy,” he answered, looking me in the eyes, and with
great emphasis. “We have all hell upon us, that’s the truth. You may
believe me or not, but I’m afraid of my life.”

“Tell me one thing,” said I. “What are they after, these Italians? What
do they want with Mr. Huddlestone?”

“Don’t you know?” he cried. “The black old scamp had_ carbonaro_ funds
on a deposit—two hundred and eighty thousand; and of course he gambled
it away on stocks. There was to have been a revolution in the
Tridentino, or Parma; but the revolution is off, and the whole wasp’s
nest is after Huddlestone. We shall all be lucky if we can save our
skins.”

“The _carbonari_!” I exclaimed; “God help him indeed!”

“Amen!” said Northmour. “And now, look here: I have said that we are in
a fix; and, frankly, I shall be glad of your help. If I can’t save
Huddlestone, I want at least to save the girl. Come and stay in the
pavilion; and, there’s my hand on it, I shall act as your friend until
the old man is either clear or dead. But,” he added, “once that is
settled, you become my rival once again, and I warn you—mind yourself.”

“Done!” said I; and we shook hands.

“And now let us go directly to the fort,” said Northmour; and he began
to lead the way through the rain.




CHAPTER VI
TELLS OF MY INTRODUCTION TO THE TALL MAN


We were admitted to the pavilion by Clara, and I was surprised by the
completeness and security of the defences. A barricade of great
strength, and yet easy to displace, supported the door against Any
violence from without; and the shutters of the dining-room, into which
I was led directly, and which was feebly illuminated by a lamp, were
even more elaborately fortified. The panels were strengthened by bars
and cross-bars; and these, in their turn, were kept in position by a
system of braces and struts, some abutting on the floor, some on the
roof, and others, in fine, against the opposite wall of the apartment.
It was at once a solid and well-designed piece of carpentry; and I did
not seek to conceal my admiration.

“I am the engineer,” said Northmour. “You remember the planks in the
garden? Behold them?”

“I did not know you had so many talents,” said I.

“Are you armed?” he continued, pointing to an array of guns and
pistols, all in admirable order, which stood in line against the wall
or were displayed upon the sideboard.

“Thank you,” I returned; “I have gone armed since our last encounter.
But, to tell you the truth, I have had nothing to eat since early
yesterday evening.”

Northmour produced some cold meat, to which I eagerly set myself, and a
bottle of good Burgundy, by which, wet as I was, I did not scruple to
profit. I have always been an extreme temperance man on principle; but
it is useless to push principle to excess, and on this occasion I
believe that I finished three-quarters of the bottle. As I ate, I still
continued to admire the preparations for defence.

“We could stand a siege,” I said at length.

“Ye-es,” drawled Northmour; “a very little one, per-haps. It is not so
much the strength of the pavilion I misdoubt; it is the doubled anger
that kills me. If we get to shooting, wild as the country is some one
is sure to hear it, and then—why then it’s the same thing, only
different, as they say: caged by law, or killed by _carbonari_. There’s
the choice. It is a devilish bad thing to have the law against you in
this world, and so I tell the old gentleman upstairs. He is quite of my
way of thinking.”

“Speaking of that,” said I, “what kind of person is he?”

“Oh, he!” cried the other; “he’s a rancid fellow, as far as he goes. I
should like to have his neck wrung to-morrow by all the devils in
Italy. I am not in this affair for him. You take me? I made a bargain
for Missy’s hand, and I mean to have it too.”

“That by the way,” said I. “I understand. But how will Mr. Huddlestone
take my intrusion?”

“Leave that to Clara,” returned Northmour.

I could have struck him in the face for this coarse familiarity; but I
respected the truce, as, I am bound to say, did Northmour, and so long
as the danger continued not a cloud arose in our relation. I bear him
this testimony with the most unfeigned satisfaction; nor am I without
pride when I look back upon my own behaviour. For surely no two men
were ever left in a position so invidious and irritating.

As soon as I had done eating, we proceeded to inspect the lower floor.
Window by window we tried the different supports, now and then making
an inconsiderable change; and the strokes of the hammer sounded with
startling loudness through the house. I proposed, I remember, to make
loop-holes; but he told me they were already made in the windows of the
upper story. It was an anxious business this inspection, and left me
down-hearted. There were two doors and five windows to protect, and,
counting Clara, only four of us to defend them against an unknown
number of foes. I communicated my doubts to Northmour, who assured me,
with unmoved composure, that he entirely shared them.

“Before morning,” said he, “we shall all be butchered and buried in
Graden Floe. For me, that is written.”

I could not help shuddering at the mention of the quicksand, but
reminded Northmour that our enemies had spared me in the wood.

“Do not flatter yourself,” said he. “Then you were not in the same boat
with the old gentleman; now you are. It’s the floe for all of us, mark
my words.”

I trembled for Clara; and just then her dear voice was heard calling us
to come upstairs. Northmour showed me the way, and, when he had reached
the landing, knocked at the door of what used to be called _My Uncle’s
Bedroom_, as the founder of the pavilion had designed it especially for
himself.

“Come in, Northmour; come in, dear Mr. Cassilis,” said a voice from
within.

Pushing open the door, Northmour admitted me before him into the
apartment. As I came in I could see the daughter slipping out by the
side door into the study, which had been prepared as her bedroom. In
the bed, which was drawn back against the wall, instead of standing, as
I had last seen it, boldly across the window, sat Bernard Huddlestone,
the defaulting banker. Little as I had seen of him by the shifting
light of the lantern on the links, I had no difficulty in recognising
him for the same. He had a long and sallow countenance, surrounded by a
long red beard and side whiskers. His broken nose and high cheekbones
gave him somewhat the air of a Kalmuck, and his light eyes shone with
the excitement of a high fever. He wore a skull-cap of black silk; a
huge Bible lay open before him on the bed, with a pair of gold
spectacles in the place, and a pile of other books lay on the stand by
his side. The green curtains lent a cadaverous shade to his cheek; and,
as he sat propped on pillows, his great stature was painfully hunched,
and his head protruded till it overhung his knees. I believe if he had
not died otherwise, he must have fallen a victim to consumption in the
course of but a very few weeks.

He held out to me a hand, long, thin, and disagreeably hairy.

“Come in, come in, Mr. Cassilis,” said he. “Another
protector—ahem!—another protector. Always welcome as a friend of my
daughter’s, Mr. Cassilis. How they have rallied about me, my daughter’s
friends! May God in heaven bless and reward them for it!”

I gave him my hand, of course, because I could not help it; but the
sympathy I had been prepared to feel for Clara’s father was immediately
soured by his appearance, and the wheedling, unreal tones in which he
spoke.

“Cassilis is a good man,” said Northmour; “worth ten.”

“So I hear,” cried Mr. Huddlestone eagerly “so my girl tells me. Ah,
Mr. Cassilis, my sin has found me out, you see! I am very low, very
low; but I hope equally penitent. We must all come to the throne of
grace at last, Mr. Cassilis. For my part, I come late indeed; but with
unfeigned humility, I trust.”

“Fiddle-de-dee!” said Northmour roughly.

“No, no, dear Northmour!” cried the banker. “You must not say that; you
must not try to shake me. You forget, my dear, good boy, you forget I
may be called this very night before my Maker.”

His excitement was pitiful to behold; and I felt myself grow indignant
with Northmour, whose infidel opinions I well knew, and heartily
derided, as he continued to taunt the poor sinner out of his humour of
repentance.

“Pooh, my dear Huddlestone!” said he. “You do yourself injustice. You
are a man of the world inside and out, and were up to all kinds of
mischief before I was born. Your conscience is tanned like South
American leather—only you forgot to tan your liver, and that, if you
will believe me, is the seat of the annoyance.”

“Rogue, rogue! bad boy!” said Mr. Huddlestone, shaking his finger. “I
am no precisian, if you come to that; I always hated a precisian; but I
never lost hold of something better through it all. I have been a bad
boy, Mr. Cassilis; I do not seek to deny that; but it was after my
wife’s death, and you know, with a widower, it’s a different thing:
sinful—I won’t say no; but there is a gradation, we shall hope. And
talking of that—Hark!” he broke out suddenly, his hand raised, his
fingers spread, his face racked with interest and terror. “Only the
rain, bless God!” he added, after a pause, and with indescribable
relief.

For some seconds he lay back among the pillows like a man near to
fainting; then he gathered himself together, and, in somewhat tremulous
tones, began once more to thank me for the share I was prepared to take
in his defence.

“One question, sir,” said I, when he had paused. “Is it true that you
have money with you?”

He seemed annoyed by the question, but admitted with reluctance that he
had a little.

“Well,” I continued, “it is their money they are after, is it not? Why
not give it up to them?”

“Ah!” replied he, shaking his head, “I have tried that already, Mr.
Cassilis; and alas that it should be so! but it is blood they want.”

“Huddlestone, that’s a little less than fair,” said Northmour. “You
should mention that what you offered them was upwards of two hundred
thousand short. The deficit is worth a reference; it is for what they
call a cool sum, Frank. Then, you see, the fellows reason in their
clear Italian way; and it seems to them, as indeed it seems to me, that
they may just as well have both while they’re about it—money and blood
together, by George, and no more trouble for the extra pleasure.”

“Is it in the pavilion?” I asked.

“It is; and I wish it were in the bottom of the sea instead,” said
Northmour; and then suddenly—“What are you making faces at me for?” he
cried to Mr. Huddlestone, on whom I had unconsciously turned my back.
“Do you think Cassilis would sell you?”

Mr. Huddlestone protested that nothing had been further from his mind.

“It is a good thing,” retorted Northmour in his ugliest manner. “You
might end by wearying us. What were you going to say?” he added,
turning to me.

“I was going to propose an occupation for the afternoon,” said I. “Let
us carry that money out, piece by piece, and lay it down before the
pavilion door. If the _carbonari_ come, why, it’s theirs at any rate.”

“No, no,” cried Mr. Huddlestone; “it does not, it cannot belong to
them! It should be distributed _pro rata_ among all my creditors.”

“Come now, Huddlestone,” said Northmour, “none of that.”

“Well, but my daughter,” moaned the wretched man.

“Your daughter will do well enough. Here are two suitors, Cassilis and
I, neither of us beggars, between whom she has to choose. And as for
yourself, to make an end of arguments, you have no right to a farthing,
and, unless I’m much mistaken, you are going to die.”

It was certainly very cruelly said; but Mr. Huddlestone was a man who
attracted little sympathy; and, although I saw him wince and shudder, I
mentally endorsed the rebuke; nay, I added a contribution of my own.

“Northmour and I,” I said, “are willing enough to help you to save your
life, but not to escape with stolen property.”

He struggled for a while with himself, as though he were on the point
of giving way to anger, but prudence had the best of the controversy.

“My dear boys,” he said, “do with me or my money what you will. I leave
all in your hands. Let me compose myself.”

And so we left him, gladly enough I am sure. The last that I saw, he
had once more taken up his great Bible, and with tremulous hands was
adjusting his spectacles to read.




CHAPTER VII
TELLS HOW A WORD WAS CRIED THROUGH THE PAVILION WINDOW


The recollection of that afternoon will always be graven on my mind.
Northmour and I were persuaded that an attack was imminent; and if it
had been in our power to alter in any way the order of events, that
power would have been used to precipitate rather than delay the
critical moment. The worst was to be anticipated; yet we could conceive
no extremity so miserable as the suspense we were now suffering. I have
never been an eager, though always a great, reader; but I never knew
books so insipid as those which I took up and cast aside that afternoon
in the pavilion. Even talk became impossible, as the hours went on. One
or other was always listening for some sound, or peering from an
upstairs window over the links. And yet not a sign indicated the
presence of our foes.

We debated over and over again my proposal with regard to the money;
and had we been in complete possession of our faculties, I am sure we
should have condemned it as unwise; but we were flustered with alarm,
grasped at a straw, and determined, although it was as much as
advertising Mr. Huddlestone’s presence in the pavilion, to carry my
proposal into effect.

The sum was part in specie, part in bank paper, and part in circular
notes payable to the name of James Gregory. We took it out, counted it,
enclosed it once more in a despatch-box belonging to Northmour, and
prepared a letter in Italian which he tied to the handle. It was signed
by both of us under oath, and declared that this was all the money
which had escaped the failure of the house of Huddlestone. This was,
perhaps, the maddest action ever perpetrated by two persons professing
to be sane. Had the despatch-box fallen into other hands than those for
which it was intended, we stood criminally convicted on our own written
testimony; but, as I have said, we were neither of us in a condition to
judge soberly, and had a thirst for action that drove us to do
something, right or wrong, rather than endure the agony of waiting.
Moreover, as we were both convinced that the hollows of the links were
alive with hidden spies upon our movements, we hoped that our
appearance with the box might lead to a parley, and, perhaps, a
compromise.

It was nearly three when we issued from the pavilion. The rain had
taken off; the sun shone quite cheerfully.

I have never seen the gulls fly so close about the house or approach so
fearlessly to human beings. On the very doorstep one flapped heavily
past our heads, and uttered its wild cry in my very ear.

“There is an omen for you,” said Northmour, who like all freethinkers
was much under the influence of superstition. “They think we are
already dead.”

I made some light rejoinder, but it was with half my heart; for the
circumstance had impressed me.

A yard or two before the gate, on a patch of smooth turf, we set down
the despatch-box; and Northmour waved a white handkerchief over his
head. Nothing replied. We raised our voices, and cried aloud in Italian
that we were there as ambassadors to arrange the quarrel; but the
stillness remained unbroken save by the sea-gulls and the surf. I had a
weight at my heart when we desisted; and I saw that even Northmour was
unusually pale. He looked over his shoulder nervously, as though he
feared that some one had crept between him and the pavilion door.

“By God,” he said in a whisper, “this is too much for me!”

I replied in the same key: “Suppose there should be none, after all!”

“Look there,” he returned, nodding with his head, as though he had been
afraid to point.

I glanced in the direction indicated; and there, from the northern
quarter of the Sea-Wood, beheld a thin column of smoke rising steadily
against the now cloudless sky.

“Northmour,” I said (we still continued to talk in whispers), “it is
not possible to endure this suspense. I prefer death fifty times over.
Stay you here to watch the pavilion; I will go forward and make sure,
if I have to walk right into their camp.”

He looked once again all round him with puckered eyes, and then nodded
assentingly to my proposal.

My heart beat like a sledge-hammer as I set out walking rapidly in the
direction of the smoke; and, though up to that moment I had felt chill
and shivering, I was suddenly conscious of a glow of heat over all my
body. The ground in this direction was very uneven; a hundred men might
have lain hidden in as many square yards about my path. But I had not
practised the business in vain, chose such routes as cut at the very
root of concealment, and, by keeping along the most convenient ridges,
commanded several hollows at a time. It was not long before I was
rewarded for my caution. Coming suddenly on to a mound somewhat more
elevated than the surrounding hummocks, I saw, not thirty yards away, a
man bent almost double, and running as fast as his attitude permitted,
along the bottom of a gully. I had dislodged one of the spies from his
ambush. As soon as I sighted him, I called loudly both in English and
Italian; and he, seeing concealment was no longer possible,
straightened himself out, leaped from the gully, and made off as
straight as an arrow for the borders of the wood.

It was none of my business to pursue; I had learned what I wanted—that
we were beleaguered and watched in the pavilion; and I returned at
once, and walking as nearly as possible in my old footsteps, to where
Northmour awaited me beside the despatch-box. He was even paler than
when I had left him, and his voice shook a little.

“Could you see what he was like?” he asked.

“He kept his back turned,” I replied.

“Let us get into the house, Frank. I don’t think I’m a coward, but I
can stand no more of this,” he whispered.

All was still and sunshiny about the pavilion as we turned to re-enter
it; even the gulls had flown in a wider circuit, and were seen
flickering along the beach and sand-hills; and this loneliness
terrified me more than a regiment under arms. It was not until the door
was barricaded that I could draw a full inspiration and relieve the
weight that lay upon my bosom. Northmour and I exchanged a steady
glance; and I suppose each made his own reflections on the white and
startled aspect of the other.

“You were right,” I said. “All is over. Shake hands, old man, for the
last time.”

“Yes,” replied he, “I will shake hands; for, as sure as I am here, I
bear no malice. But, remember, if, by some impossible accident, we
should give the slip to these blackguards, I’ll take the upper hand of
you by fair or foul.”

“Oh,” said I, “you weary me!”

He seemed hurt, and walked away in silence to the foot of the stairs,
where he paused.

“You do not understand,” said he. “I am not a swindler, and I guard
myself; that is all. It may weary you or not, Mr. Cassilis, I do not
care a rush; I speak for my own satisfaction, and not for your
amusement. You had better go upstairs and court the girl; for my part,
I stay here.”

“And I stay with you,” I returned. “Do you think I would steal a march,
even with your permission?”

“Frank,” he said, smiling, “it’s a pity you are an ass, for you have
the makings of a man. I think I must be _fey_ to-day; you cannot
irritate me even when you try. Do you know,” he continued softly, “I
think we are the two most miserable men in England, you and I? we have
got on to thirty without wife or child, or so much as a shop to look
after—poor, pitiful, lost devils, both! And now we clash about a girl!
As if there were not several millions in the United Kingdom! Ah, Frank,
Frank, the one who loses this throw, be it you or me, he has my pity!
It were better for him—how does the Bible say?—that a millstone were
hanged about his neck and he were cast into the depth of the sea. Let
us take a drink,” he concluded suddenly, but without any levity of
tone.

I was touched by his words, and consented. He sat down on the table in
the dining-room, and held up the glass of sherry to his eye.

“If you beat me, Frank,” he said, “I shall take to drink. What will you
do, if it goes the other way?”

“God knows,” I returned.

“Well,” said he, “here is a toast in the meantime: ‘_Italia
irredenta_!’”

The remainder of the day was passed in the same dreadful tedium and
suspense. I laid the table for dinner, while Northmour and Clara
prepared the meal together in the kitchen. I could hear their talk as I
went to and fro, and was surprised to find it ran all the time upon
myself. Northmour again bracketed us together, and rallied Clara on a
choice of husbands; but he continued to speak of me with some feeling,
and uttered nothing to my prejudice unless he included himself in the
condemnation. This awakened a sense of gratitude in my heart, which
combined with the immediateness of our peril to fill my eyes with
tears. After all, I thought—and perhaps the thought was laughably
vain—we were here three very noble human beings to perish in defence of
a thieving banker.

Before we sat down to table, I looked forth from an upstairs window.
The day was beginning to decline; the links were utterly deserted; the
despatch-box still lay untouched where we had left it hours before.

Mr. Huddlestone, in a long yellow dressing-gown, took one end of the
table, Clara the other; while Northmour and I faced each other from the
sides. The lamp was brightly trimmed; the wine was good; the viands,
although mostly cold, excellent of their sort. We seemed to have agreed
tacitly; all reference to the impending catastrophe was carefully
avoided; and, considering our tragic circumstances, we made a merrier
party than could have been expected. From time to time, it is true,
Northmour or I would rise from table and make a round of the defences;
and, on each of these occasions, Mr. Huddlestone was recalled to a
sense of his tragic predicament, glanced up with ghastly eyes, and bore
for an instant on his countenance the stamp of terror. But he hastened
to empty his glass, wiped his forehead with his handkerchief, and
joined again in the conversation.

I was astonished at the wit and information he displayed. Mr.
Huddlestone’s was certainly no ordinary character; he had read and
observed for himself; his gifts were sound; and, though I could never
have learned to love the man, I began to understand his success in
business, and the great respect in which he had been held before his
failure. He had, above all, the talent of society; and though I never
heard him speak but on this one and most unfavourable occasion, I set
him down among the most brilliant conversationalists I ever met.

He was relating with great gusto, and seemingly no feeling of shame,
the manœuvres of a scoundrelly commission merchant whom he had known
and studied in his youth, and we were all listening with an odd mixture
of mirth and embarrassment when our little party was brought abruptly
to an end in the most startling manner.

A noise like that of a wet finger on the window-pane interrupted Mr.
Huddlestone’s tale; and in an instant we were all four as white as
paper, and sat tongue-tied and motionless round the table.

“A snail,” I said at last; for I had heard that these animals make a
noise somewhat similar in character.

“Snail be d—d!” said Northmour. “Hush!”

The same sound was repeated twice at regular intervals; and then a
formidable voice shouted through the shutters the Italian word
“_Traditore_!”

Mr. Huddlestone threw his head in the air; his eyelids quivered; next
moment he fell insensible below the table. Northmour and I had each run
to the armoury and seized a gun. Clara was on her feet with her hand at
her throat.

So we stood waiting, for we thought the hour of attack was certainly
come; but second passed after second, and all but the surf remained
silent in the neighbourhood of the pavilion.

“Quick,” said Northmour; “upstairs with him before they come.”




CHAPTER VIII
TELLS THE LAST OF THE TALL MAN


Somehow or other, by hook and crook, and between the three of us, we
got Bernard Huddlestone bundled upstairs and laid upon the bed in _My
Uncle’s Room_. During the whole process, which was rough enough, he
gave no sign of consciousness, and he remained, as we had thrown him,
without changing the position of a finger. His daughter opened his
shirt and began to wet his head and bosom; while Northmour and I ran to
the window. The weather continued clear; the moon, which was now about
full, had risen and shed a very clear light upon the links; yet, strain
our eyes as we might, we could distinguish nothing moving. A few dark
spots, more or less, on the uneven expanse were not to be identified;
they might be crouching men, they might be shadows; it was impossible
to be sure.

“Thank God,” said Northmour, “Aggie is not coming to-night.”

Aggie was the name of the old nurse; he had not thought of her till
now; but that he should think of her at all, was a trait that surprised
me in the man.

We were again reduced to waiting. Northmour went to the fireplace and
spread his hands before the red embers, as if he were cold. I followed
him mechanically with my eyes, and in so doing turned my back upon the
window. At that moment a very faint report was audible from without,
and a ball shivered a pane of glass, and buried itself in the shutter
two inches from my head. I heard Clara scream; and though I whipped
instantly out of range and into a corner, she was there, so to speak,
before me, beseeching to know if I were hurt. I felt that I could stand
to be shot at every day and all day long, with such marks of solicitude
for a reward; and I continued to reassure her, with the tenderest
caresses and in complete forgetfulness of our situation, till the voice
of Northmour recalled me to myself.

“An air-gun,” he said. “They wish to make no noise.”

I put Clara aside, and looked at him. He was standing with his back to
the fire and his hands clasped behind him; and I knew by the black look
on his face, that passion was boiling within. I had seen just such a
look before he attacked me, that March night, in the adjoining chamber;
and, though I could make every allowance for his anger, I confess I
trembled for the consequences. He gazed straight before him; but he
could see us with the tail of his eye, and his temper kept rising like
a gale of wind. With regular battle awaiting us outside, this prospect
of an internecine strife within the walls began to daunt me.

Suddenly, as I was thus closely watching his expression and prepared
against the worst, I saw a change, a flash, a look of relief, upon his
face. He took up the lamp which stood beside him on the table, and
turned to us with an air of some excitement.

“There is one point that we must know,” said he. “Are they going to
butcher the lot of us, or only Huddlestone? Did they take you for him,
or fire at you for your own _beaux yeux_?”

“They took me for him, for certain,” I replied. “I am near as tall, and
my head is fair.”

“I am going to make sure,” returned Northmour; and he stepped up to the
window, holding the lamp above his head, and stood there, quietly
affronting death, for half a minute.

Clara sought to rush forward and pull him from the place of danger; but
I had the pardonable selfishness to hold her back by force.

“Yes,” said Northmour, turning coolly from the window; “it’s only
Huddlestone they want.”

“Oh, Mr. Northmour!” cried Clara; but found no more to add; the
temerity she had just witnessed seeming beyond the reach of words.

He, on his part, looked at me, cocking his head, with a fire of triumph
in his eyes; and I understood at once that he had thus hazarded his
life, merely to attract Clara’s notice, and depose me from my position
as the hero of the hour. He snapped his fingers.

“The fire is only beginning,” said he. “When they warm up to their
work, they won’t be so particular.”

A voice was now heard hailing us from the entrance. From the window we
could see the figure of a man in the moonlight; he stood motionless,
his face uplifted to ours, and a rag of something white on his extended
arm; and as we looked right down upon him, though he was a good many
yards distant on the links, we could see the moonlight glitter on his
eyes.

He opened his lips again, and spoke for some minutes on end, in a key
so loud that he might have been heard in every corner of the pavilion,
and as far away as the borders of the wood. It was the same voice that
had already shouted “_Traditore_!” through the shutters of the
dining-room; this time it made a complete and clear statement. If the
traitor “Oddlestone” were given up, all others should be spared; if
not, no one should escape to tell the tale.

“Well, Huddlestone, what do you say to that?” asked Northmour, turning
to the bed.

Up to that moment the banker had given no sign of life, and I, at
least, had supposed him to be still lying in a faint; but he replied at
once, and in such tones as I have never heard elsewhere, save from a
delirious patient, adjured and besought us not to desert him. It was
the most hideous and abject performance that my imagination can
conceive.

“Enough,” cried Northmour; and then he threw open the window, leaned
out into the night, and in a tone of exultation, and with a total
forgetfulness of what was due to the presence of a lady, poured out
upon the ambassador a string of the most abominable raillery both in
English and Italian, and bade him be gone where he had come from. I
believe that nothing so delighted Northmour at that moment as the
thought that we must all infallibly perish before the night was out.

Meantime the Italian put his flag of truce into his pocket, and
disappeared, at a leisurely pace, among the sand-hills.

“They make honourable war,” said Northmour. “They are all gentlemen and
soldiers. For the credit of the thing, I wish we could change sides—you
and I, Frank, and you too, Missy, my darling—and leave that being on
the bed to some one else. Tut! Don’t look shocked! We are all going
post to what they call eternity, and may as well be above-board while
there’s time. As far as I’m concerned, if I could first strangle
Huddlestone and then get Clara in my arms, I could die with some pride
and satisfaction. And as it is, by God, I’ll have a kiss!”

Before I could do anything to interfere, he had rudely embraced and
repeatedly kissed the resisting girl. Next moment I had pulled him away
with fury, and flung him heavily against the wall. He laughed loud and
long, and I feared his wits had given way under the strain; for even in
the best of days he had been a sparing and a quiet laugher.

“Now, Frank,” said he, when his mirth was somewhat appeased, “it’s your
turn. Here’s my hand. Good-bye; farewell!” Then, seeing me stand rigid
and indignant, and holding Clara to my side—“Man!” he broke out, “are
you angry? Did you think we were going to die with all the airs and
graces of society? I took a kiss; I’m glad I had it; and now you can
take another if you like, and square accounts.”

I turned from him with a feeling of contempt which I did not seek to
dissemble.

“As you please,” said he. “You’ve been a prig in life; a prig you’ll
die.”

And with that he sat down in a chair, a rifle over his knee, and amused
himself with snapping the lock; but I could see that his ebullition of
light spirits (the only one I ever knew him to display) had already
come to an end, and was succeeded by a sullen, scowling humour.

All this time our assailants might have been entering the house, and we
been none the wiser; we had in truth almost forgotten the danger that
so imminently overhung our days. But just then Mr. Huddlestone uttered
a cry, and leaped from the bed.

I asked him what was wrong.

“Fire!” he cried. “They have set the house on fire!”

Northmour was on his feet in an instant, and he and I ran through the
door of communication with the study. The room was illuminated by a red
and angry light. Almost at the moment of our entrance, a tower of flame
arose in front of the window, and, with a tingling report, a pane fell
inwards on the carpet. They had set fire to the lean-to outhouse, where
Northmour used to nurse his negatives.

“Hot work,” said Northmour. “Let us try in your old room.”

We ran thither in a breath, threw up the casement, and looked forth.
Along the whole back wall of the pavilion piles of fuel had been
arranged and kindled; and it is probable they had been drenched with
mineral oil, for, in spite of the morning’s rain, they all burned
bravely. The fire had taken a firm hold already on the outhouse, which
blazed higher and higher every moment; the back door was in the centre
of a red-hot bonfire; the eaves we could see, as we looked upward, were
already smouldering, for the roof overhung, and was supported by
considerable beams of wood. At the same time, hot, pungent, and choking
volumes of smoke began to fill the house. There was not a human being
to be seen to right or left.

“Ah, well!” said Northmour, “here’s the end, thank God.”

And we returned to _My Uncle’s Room_. Mr. Huddlestone was putting on
his boots, still violently trembling, but with an air of determination
such as I had not hitherto observed. Clara stood close by him, with her
cloak in both hands ready to throw about her shoulders, and a strange
look in her eyes, as if she were half hopeful, half doubtful of her
father.

“Well, boys and girls,” said Northmour, “how about a sally? The oven is
heating; it is not good to stay here and be baked; and, for my part, I
want to come to my hands with them, and be done.”

“There is nothing else left,” I replied.

And both Clara and Mr. Huddlestone, though with a very different
intonation, added, “Nothing.”

As we went downstairs the heat was excessive, and the roaring of the
fire filled our ears; and we had scarce reached the passage before the
stairs window fell in, a branch of flame shot brandishing through the
aperture, and the interior of the pavilion became lit up with that
dreadful and fluctuating glare. At the same moment we heard the fall of
something heavy and inelastic in the upper story. The whole pavilion,
it was plain, had gone alight like a box of matches, and now not only
flamed sky-high to land and sea, but threatened with every moment to
crumble and fall in about our ears.

Northmour and I cocked our revolvers. Mr. Huddlestone, who had already
refused a firearm, put us behind him with a manner of command.

“Let Clara open the door,” said he. “So, if they fire a volley, she
will be protected. And in the meantime stand behind me. I am the
scapegoat; my sins have found me out.”

I heard him, as I stood breathless by his shoulder, with my pistol
ready, pattering off prayers in a tremulous, rapid whisper; and I
confess, horrid as the thought may seem, I despised him for thinking of
supplications in a moment so critical and thrilling. In the meantime,
Clara, who was dead white but still possessed her faculties, had
displaced the barricade from the front door. Another moment, and she
had pulled it open. Firelight and moonlight illuminated the links with
confused and changeful lustre, and far away against the sky we could
see a long trail of glowing smoke.

Mr. Huddlestone, filled for the moment with a strength greater than his
own, struck Northmour and myself a back-hander in the chest; and while
we were thus for the moment incapacitated from action, lifting his arms
above his head like one about to dive, he ran straight forward out of
the pavilion.

“Here am I!” he cried—“Huddlestone! Kill me, and spare the others!”

His sudden appearance daunted, I suppose, our hidden enemies; for
Northmour and I had time to recover, to seize Clara between us, one by
each arm, and to rush forth to his assistance, ere anything further had
taken place. But scarce had we passed the threshold when there came
near a dozen reports and flashes from every direction among the hollows
of the links. Mr. Huddlestone staggered, uttered a weird and freezing
cry, threw up his arms over his head, and fell backward on the turf.

“_Traditore_! _Traditore_!” cried the invisible avengers.

And just then, a part of the roof of the pavilion fell in, so rapid was
the progress of the fire. A loud, vague, and horrible noise accompanied
the collapse, and a vast volume of flame went soaring up to heaven. It
must have been visible at that moment from twenty miles out at sea,
from the shore at Graden Wester, and far inland from the peak of
Graystiel, the most eastern summit of the Caulder Hills. Bernard
Huddlestone, although God knows what were his obsequies, had a fine
pyre at the moment of his death.




CHAPTER IX
TELLS HOW NORTHMOUR CARRIED OUT HIS THREAT


I should have the greatest difficulty to tell you what followed next
after this tragic circumstance. It is all to me, as I look back upon
it, mixed, strenuous, and ineffectual, like the struggles of a sleeper
in a nightmare. Clara, I remember, uttered a broken sigh and would have
fallen forward to earth, had not Northmour and I supported her
insensible body. I do not think we were attacked; I do not remember
even to have seen an assailant; and I believe we deserted Mr.
Huddlestone without a glance. I only remember running like a man in a
panic, now carrying Clara altogether in my own arms, now sharing her
weight with Northmour, now scuffling confusedly for the possession of
that dear burden. Why we should have made for my camp in the Hemlock
Den, or how we reached it, are points lost for ever to my recollection.
The first moment at which I became definitely sure, Clara had been
suffered to fall against the outside of my little tent, Northmour and I
were tumbling together on the ground, and he, with contained ferocity,
was striking for my head with the butt of his revolver. He had already
twice wounded me on the scalp; and it is to the consequent loss of
blood that I am tempted to attribute the sudden clearness of my mind.

I caught him by the wrist.

“Northmour,” I remember saying, “you can kill me afterwards. Let us
first attend to Clara.”

He was at that moment uppermost. Scarcely had the words passed my lips,
when he had leaped to his feet and ran towards the tent; and the next
moment, he was straining Clara to his heart and covering her
unconscious hands and face with his caresses.

“Shame!” I cried. “Shame to you, Northmour!”

And, giddy though I still was, I struck him repeatedly upon the head
and shoulders.

He relinquished his grasp, and faced me in the broken moonlight.

“I had you under, and I let you go,” said he; “and now you strike me!
Coward!”

“You are the coward,” I retorted. “Did she wish your kisses while she
was still sensible of what she wanted? Not she! And now she may be
dying; and you waste this precious time, and abuse her helplessness.
Stand aside, and let me help her.”

He confronted me for a moment, white and menacing; then suddenly he
stepped aside.

“Help her then,” said he.

I threw myself on my knees beside her, and loosened, as well as I was
able, her dress and corset; but while I was thus engaged, a grasp
descended on my shoulder.

“Keep your hands off her,” said Northmour fiercely. “Do you think I
have no blood in my veins?”

“Northmour,” I cried, “if you will neither help her yourself, nor let
me do so, do you know that I shall have to kill you?”

“That is better!” he cried. “Let her die also, where’s the harm? Step
aside from that girl! and stand up to fight”

“You will observe,” said I, half rising, “that I have not kissed her
yet.”

“I dare you to,” he cried.

I do not know what possessed me; it was one of the things I am most
ashamed of in my life, though, as my wife used to say, I knew that my
kisses would be always welcome were she dead or living; down I fell
again upon my knees, parted the hair from her forehead, and, with the
dearest respect, laid my lips for a moment on that cold brow. It was
such a caress as a father might have given; it was such a one as was
not unbecoming from a man soon to die to a woman already dead.

“And now,” said I, “I am at your service, Mr. Northmour.”

But I saw, to my surprise, that he had turned his back upon me.

“Do you hear?” I asked.

“Yes,” said he, “I do. If you wish to fight, I am ready. If not, go on
and save Clara. All is one to me.”

I did not wait to be twice bidden; but, stooping again over Clara,
continued my efforts to revive her. She still lay white and lifeless; I
began to fear that her sweet spirit had indeed fled beyond recall, and
horror and a sense of utter desolation seized upon my heart. I called
her by name with the most endearing inflections; I chafed and beat her
hands; now I laid her head low, now supported it against my knee; but
all seemed to be in vain, and the lids still lay heavy on her eyes.

“Northmour,” I said, “there is my hat. For God’s sake bring some water
from the spring.”

Almost in a moment he was by my side with the water. “I have brought it
in my own,” he said. “You do not grudge me the privilege?”

“Northmour,” I was beginning to say, as I laved her head and breast;
but he interrupted me savagely.

“Oh, you hush up!” he said. “The best thing you can do is to say
nothing.”

I had certainly no desire to talk, my mind being swallowed up in
concern for my dear love and her condition; so I continued in silence
to do my best towards her recovery, and, when the hat was empty,
returned it to him, with one word—“More.” He had, perhaps, gone several
times upon this errand, when Clara reopened her eyes.

“Now,” said he, “since she is better, you can spare me, can you not? I
wish you a good night, Mr. Cassilis.”

And with that he was gone among the thicket. I made a fire, for I had
now no fear of the Italians, who had even spared all the little
possessions left in my encampment; and, broken as she was by the
excitement and the hideous catastrophe of the evening, I managed, in
one way or another—by persuasion, encouragement, warmth, and such
simple remedies as I could lay my hand on—to bring her back to some
composure of mind and strength of body.

Day had already come, when a sharp “Hist!” sounded from the thicket. I
started from the ground; but the voice of Northmour was heard adding,
in the most tranquil tones: “Come here, Cassilis, and alone; I want to
show you something.”

I consulted Clara with my eyes, and, receiving her tacit permission,
left her alone, and clambered out of the den. At some distance of I saw
Northmour leaning against an elder; and, as soon as he perceived me, he
began walking seaward. I had almost overtaken him as he reached the
outskirts of the wood.

“Look,” said he, pausing.

A couple of steps more brought me out of the foliage. The light of the
morning lay cold and clear over that well-known scene. The pavilion was
but a blackened wreck; the roof had fallen in, one of the gables had
fallen out; and, far and near, the face of the links was cicatrised
with little patches of burnt furze. Thick smoke still went straight
upwards in the windless air of the morning, and a great pile of ardent
cinders filled the bare walls of the house, like coals in an open
grate. Close by the islet a schooner yacht lay to, and a well-manned
boat was pulling vigorously for the shore.

“The _Red Earl_!” I cried. “The _Red Earl_ twelve hours too late!”

“Feel in your pocket, Frank. Are you armed?” asked Northmour.

I obeyed him, and I think I must have become deadly pale. My revolver
had been taken from me.

“You see I have you in my power,” he continued. “I disarmed you last
night while you were nursing Clara; but this morning—here—take your
pistol. No thanks!” he cried, holding up his hand. “I do not like them;
that is the only way you can annoy me now.”

He began to walk forward across the links to meet the boat, and I
followed a step or two behind. In front of the pavilion I paused to see
where Mr. Huddlestone had fallen; but there was no sign of him, nor so
much as a trace of blood.

“Graden Floe,” said Northmour.

He continued to advance till we had come to the head of the beach.

“No farther, please,” said he. “Would you like to take her to Graden
House?”

“Thank you,” replied I; “I shall try to get her to the minister’s at
Graden Wester.”

The prow of the boat here grated on the beach, and a sailor jumped
ashore with a line in his hand.

“Wait a minute, lads!” cried Northmour; and then lower and to my
private ear: “You had better say nothing of all this to her,” he added.

“On the contrary!” I broke out, “she shall know everything that I can
tell.”

“You do not understand,” he returned, with an air of great dignity. “It
will be nothing to her; she expects it of me. Good-bye!” he added, with
a nod.

I offered him my hand.

“Excuse me,” said he. “It’s small, I know; but I can’t push things
quite so far as that. I don’t wish any sentimental business, to sit by
your hearth a white-haired wanderer, and all that. Quite the contrary:
I hope to God I shall never again clap eyes on either one of you.”

“Well, God bless you, Northmour!” I said heartily.

“Oh, yes,” he returned.

He walked down the beach; and the man who was ashore gave him an arm on
board, and then shoved off and leaped into the bows himself. Northmour
took the tiller; the boat rose to the waves, and the oars between the
thole-pins sounded crisp and measured in the morning air.

They were not yet half-way to the _Red Earl_, and I was still watching
their progress, when the sun rose out of the sea.

One word more, and my story is done. Years after, Northmour was killed
fighting under the colours of Garibaldi for the liberation of the
Tyrol.




A LODGING FOR THE NIGHT
A STORY OF FRANCIS VILLON


It was late in November 1456. The snow fell over Paris with rigorous,
relentless persistence; sometimes the wind made a sally and scattered
it in flying vortices; sometimes there was a lull, and flake after
flake descended out of the black night air, silent, circuitous,
interminable. To poor people, looking up under moist eyebrows, it
seemed a wonder where it all came from. Master Francis Villon had
propounded an alternative that afternoon, at a tavern window: was it
only Pagan Jupiter plucking geese upon Olympus? or were the holy angels
moulting? He was only a poor Master of Arts, he went on; and as the
question somewhat touched upon divinity, he durst not venture to
conclude. A silly old priest from Montargis, who was among the company,
treated the young rascal to a bottle of wine in honour of the jest and
the grimaces with which it was accompanied, and swore on his own white
beard that he had been just such another irreverent dog when he was
Villon’s age.

The air was raw and pointed, but not far below freezing; and the flakes
were large, damp, and adhesive. The whole city was sheeted up. An army
might have marched from end to end and not a footfall given the alarm.
If there were any belated birds in heaven, they saw the island like a
large white patch, and the bridges like slim white spars, on the black
ground of the river. High up overhead the snow settled among the
tracery of the cathedral towers. Many a niche was drifted full; many a
statue wore a long white bonnet on its grotesque or sainted head. The
gargoyles had been transformed into great false noses, drooping towards
the point. The crockets were like upright pillows swollen on one side.
In the intervals of the wind, there was a dull sound of dripping about
the precincts of the church.

The cemetery of St. John had taken its own share of the snow. All the
graves were decently covered; tall white housetops stood around in
grave array; worthy burghers were long ago in bed, benightcapped like
their domiciles; there was no light in all the neighbourhood but a
little peep from a lamp that hung swinging in the church choir, and
tossed the shadows to and fro in time to its oscillations. The clock
was hard on ten when the patrol went by with halberds and a lantern,
beating their hands; and they saw nothing suspicious about the cemetery
of St. John.

Yet there was a small house, backed up against the cemetery wall, which
was still awake, and awake to evil purpose, in that snoring district.
There was not much to betray it from without; only a stream of warm
vapour from the chimney-top, a patch where the snow melted on the roof,
and a few half-obliterated footprints at the door. But within, behind
the shuttered windows, Master Francis Villon the poet, and some of the
thievish crew with whom he consorted, were keeping the night alive and
passing round the bottle.

A great pile of living embers diffused a strong and ruddy glow from the
arched chimney. Before this straddled Dom Nicolas, the Picardy monk,
with his skirts picked up and his fat legs bared to the comfortable
warmth. His dilated shadow cut the room in half; and the firelight only
escaped on either side of his broad person, and in a little pool
between his outspread feet. His face had the beery, bruised appearance
of the continual drinker’s; it was covered with a network of congested
veins, purple in ordinary circumstances, but now pale violet, for even
with his back to the fire the cold pinched him on the other side. His
cowl had half fallen back, and made a strange excrescence on either
side of his bull neck. So he straddled, grumbling, and cut the room in
half with the shadow of his portly frame.

On the right, Villon and Guy Tabary were huddled together over a scrap
of parchment; Villon making a ballade which he was to call the “Ballade
of Roast Fish,” and Tabary spluttering admiration at his shoulder. The
poet was a rag of a man, dark, little, and lean, with hollow cheeks and
thin black locks. He carried his four-and-twenty years with feverish
animation. Greed had made folds about his eyes, evil smiles had
puckered his mouth. The wolf and pig struggled together in his face. It
was an eloquent, sharp, ugly, earthly countenance. His hands were small
and prehensile, with fingers knotted like a cord; and they were
continually flickering in front of him in violent and expressive
pantomime. As for Tabary, a broad, complacent, admiring imbecility
breathed from his squash nose and slobbering lips: he had become a
thief, just as he might have become the most decent of burgesses, by
the imperious chance that rules the lives of human geese and human
donkeys.

At the monk’s other hand, Montigny and Thevenin Pensete played a game
of chance. About the first there clung some flavour of good birth and
training, as about a fallen angel; something long, lithe, and courtly
in the person; something aquiline and darkling in the face. Thevenin,
poor soul, was in great feather: he had done a good stroke of knavery
that afternoon in the Faubourg St. Jacques, and all night he had been
gaining from Montigny. A flat smile illuminated his face; his bald head
shone rosily in a garland of red curls; his little protuberant stomach
shook with silent chucklings as he swept in his gains.

“Doubles or quits?” said Thevenin. Montigny nodded grimly.

“_Some may prefer to dine in state_,” wrote Villon, “_On bread and
cheese on silver plate_. Or—or—help me out, Guido!”

Tabary giggled.

“_Or parsley on a golden dish_,” scribbled the poet.

The wind was freshening without; it drove the snow before it, and
sometimes raised its voice in a victorious whoop, and made sepulchral
grumblings in the chimney. The cold was growing sharper as the night
went on. Villon, protruding his lips, imitated the gust with something
between a whistle and a groan. It was an eerie, uncomfortable talent of
the poet’s, much detested by the Picardy monk.

“Can’t you hear it rattle in the gibbet?” said Villon. “They are all
dancing the devil’s jig on nothing, up there. You may dance, my
gallants, you’ll be none the warmer! Whew! what a gust! Down went
somebody just now! A medlar the fewer on the three-legged
medlar-tree!—I say, Dom Nicolas, it’ll be cold to-night on the St.
Denis Road?” he asked.

Dom Nicolas winked both his big eyes, and seemed to choke upon his
Adam’s apple. Montfaucon, the great grisly Paris gibbet, stood hard by
the St. Denis Road, and the pleasantry touched him on the raw. As for
Tabary, he laughed immoderately over the medlars; he had never heard
anything more light-hearted; and he held his sides and crowed. Villon
fetched him a fillip on the nose, which turned his mirth into an attack
of coughing.

“Oh, stop that row,” said Villon, “and think of rhymes to ‘fish’.”

“Doubles or quits,” said Montigny doggedly.

“With all my heart,” quoth Thevenin.

“Is there any more in that bottle?” asked the monk.

“Open another,” said Villon. “How do you ever hope to fill that big
hogshead, your body, with little things like bottles? And how do you
expect to get to heaven? How many angels, do you fancy, can be spared
to carry up a single monk from Picardy? Or do you think yourself
another Elias—and they’ll send the coach for you?”

“_Hominibus impossibile_,” replied the monk, as he filled his glass.

Tabary was in ecstasies.

Villon filliped his nose again.

“Laugh at my jokes, if you like,” he said.

“It was very good,” objected Tabary.

Villon made a face at him. “Think of rhymes to ‘fish’,” he said. “What
have you to do with Latin? You’ll wish you knew none of it at the great
assizes, when the devil calls for Guido Tabary, clericus—the devil with
the hump-back and red-hot finger-nails. Talking of the devil,” he added
in a whisper, “look at Montigny!”

All three peered covertly at the gamester. He did not seem to be
enjoying his luck. His mouth was a little to a side; one nostril nearly
shut, and the other much inflated. The black dog was on his back, as
people say, in terrifying nursery metaphor; and he breathed hard under
the gruesome burden.

“He looks as if he could knife him,” whispered Tabary, with round eyes.

The monk shuddered, and turned his face and spread his open hands to
the red embers. It was the cold that thus affected Dom Nicolas, and not
any excess of moral sensibility.

“Come now,” said Villon—“about this ballade. How does it run so far?”
And beating time with his hand, he read it aloud to Tabary.

They were interrupted at the fourth rhyme by a brief and fatal movement
among the gamesters. The round was completed, and Thevenin was just
opening his mouth to claim another victory, when Montigny leaped up,
swift as an adder, and stabbed him to the heart. The blow took effect
before he had time to utter a cry, before he had time to move. A tremor
or two convulsed his frame; his hands opened and shut, his heels
rattled on the floor; then his head rolled backward over one shoulder
with the eyes wide open; and Thevenin Pensete’s spirit had returned to
Him who made it.

Everyone sprang to his feet; but the business was over in two twos. The
four living fellows looked at each other in rather a ghastly fashion;
the dead man contemplating a corner of the roof with a singular and
ugly leer.

“My God!” said Tabary; and he began to pray in Latin.

Villon broke out into hysterical laughter. He came a step forward and
ducked a ridiculous bow at Thevenin, and laughed still louder. Then he
sat down suddenly, all of a heap, upon a stool, and continued laughing
bitterly as though he would shake himself to pieces.

Montigny recovered his composure first.

“Let’s see what he has about him,” he remarked; and he picked the dead
man’s pockets with a practised hand, and divided the money into four
equal portions on the table. “There’s for you,” he said.

The monk received his share with a deep sigh, and a single stealthy
glance at the dead Thevenin, who was beginning to sink into himself and
topple sideways of the chair.

“We’re all in for it,” cried Villon, swallowing his mirth. “It’s a
hanging job for every man jack of us that’s here—not to speak of those
who aren’t.” He made a shocking gesture in the air with his raised
right hand, and put out his tongue and threw his head on one side, so
as to counterfeit the appearance of one who has been hanged. Then he
pocketed his share of the spoil, and executed a shuffle with his feet
as if to restore the circulation.

Tabary was the last to help himself; he made a dash at the money, and
retired to the other end of the apartment.

Montigny stuck Thevenin upright in the chair, and drew out the dagger,
which was followed by a jet of blood.

“You fellows had better be moving,” he said, as he wiped the blade on
his victim’s doublet.

“I think we had,” returned Villon with a gulp. “Damn his fat head!” he
broke out. “It sticks in my throat like phlegm. What right has a man to
have red hair when he is dead?” And he fell all of a heap again upon
the stool, and fairly covered his face with his hands.

Montigny and Dom Nicolas laughed aloud, even Tabary feebly chiming in.

“Cry baby,” said the monk.

“I always said he was a woman,” added Montigny with a sneer. “Sit up,
can’t you?” he went on, giving another shake to the murdered body.
“Tread out that fire, Nick!”

But Nick was better employed; he was quietly taking Villon’s purse, as
the poet sat, limp and trembling, on the stool where he had been making
a ballade not three minutes before. Montigny and Tabary dumbly demanded
a share of the booty, which the monk silently promised as he passed the
little bag into the bosom of his gown. In many ways an artistic nature
unfits a man for practical existence.

No sooner had the theft been accomplished than Villon shook himself,
jumped to his feet, and began helping to scatter and extinguish the
embers. Meanwhile Montigny opened the door and cautiously peered into
the street. The coast was clear; there was no meddlesome patrol in
sight. Still it was judged wiser to slip out severally; and as Villon
was himself in a hurry to escape from the neighbourhood of the dead
Thevenin, and the rest were in a still greater hurry to get rid of him
before he should discover the loss of his money, he was the first by
general consent to issue forth into the street.

The wind had triumphed and swept all the clouds from heaven. Only a few
vapours, as thin as moonlight, fleeting rapidly across the stars. It
was bitter cold; and by a common optical effect, things seemed almost
more definite than in the broadest daylight. The sleeping city was
absolutely still: a company of white hoods, a field full of little
Alps, below the twinkling stars. Villon cursed his fortune. Would it
were still snowing! Now, wherever he went, he left an indelible trail
behind him on the glittering streets; wherever he went he was still
tethered to the house by the cemetery of St. John; wherever he went he
must weave, with his own plodding feet, the rope that bound him to the
crime and would bind him to the gallows. The leer of the dead man came
back to him with a new significance. He snapped his fingers as if to
pluck up his own spirits, and choosing a street at random, stepped
boldly forward in the snow.

Two things preoccupied him as he went: the aspect of the gallows at
Montfaucon in this bright windy phase of the night’s existence, for
one; and for another, the look of the dead man with his bald head and
garland of red curls. Both struck cold upon his heart, and he kept
quickening his pace as if he could escape from unpleasant thoughts by
mere fleetness of foot. Sometimes he looked back over his shoulder with
a sudden nervous jerk; but he was the only moving thing in the white
streets, except when the wind swooped round a corner and threw up the
snow, which was beginning to freeze, in spouts of glittering dust.

Suddenly he saw, a long way before him, a black clump and a couple of
lanterns. The clump was in motion, and the lanterns swung as though
carried by men walking. It was a patrol. And though it was merely
crossing his line of march, he judged it wiser to get out of eyeshot as
speedily as he could. He was not in the humour to be challenged, and he
was conscious of making a very conspicuous mark upon the snow. Just on
his left hand there stood a great hotel, with some turrets and a large
porch before the door; it was half-ruinous, he remembered, and had long
stood empty; and so he made three steps of it and jumped into the
shelter of the porch. It was pretty dark inside, after the glimmer of
the snowy streets, and he was groping forward with outspread hands,
when he stumbled over some substance which offered an indescribable
mixture of resistances, hard and soft, firm and loose. His heart gave a
leap, and he sprang two steps back and stared dreadfully at the
obstacle. Then he gave a little laugh of relief. It was only a woman,
and she dead. He knelt beside her to make sure upon this latter point.
She was freezing cold, and rigid like a stick. A little ragged finery
fluttered in the wind about her hair, and her cheeks had been heavily
rouged that same afternoon. Her pockets were quite empty; but in her
stocking, underneath the garter, Villon found two of the small coins
that went by the name of whites. It was little enough; but it was
always something; and the poet was moved with a deep sense of pathos
that she should have died before she had spent her money. That seemed
to him a dark and pitiable mystery; and he looked from the coins in his
hand to the dead woman, and back again to the coins, shaking his head
over the riddle of man’s life. Henry V. of England, dying at Vincennes
just after he had conquered France, and this poor jade cut off by a
cold draught in a great man’s doorway, before she had time to spend her
couple of whites—it seemed a cruel way to carry on the world. Two
whites would have taken such a little while to squander; and yet it
would have been one more good taste in the mouth, one more smack of the
lips, before the devil got the soul, and the body was left to birds and
vermin. He would like to use all his tallow before the light was blown
out and the lantern broken.

While these thoughts were passing through his mind, he was feeling,
half mechanically, for his purse. Suddenly his heart stopped beating; a
feeling of cold scales passed up the back of his legs, and a cold blow
seemed to fall upon his scalp. He stood petrified for a moment; then he
felt again with one feverish movement; and then his loss burst upon
him, and he was covered at once with perspiration. To spendthrifts
money is so living and actual—it is such a thin veil between them and
their pleasures! There is only one limit to their fortune—that of time;
and a spendthrift with only a few crowns is the Emperor of Rome until
they are spent. For such a person to lose his money is to suffer the
most shocking reverse, and fall from heaven to hell, from all to
nothing, in a breath. And all the more if he has put his head in the
halter for it; if he may be hanged to-morrow for that same purse, so
dearly earned, so foolishly departed! Villon stood and cursed; he threw
the two whites into the street; he shook his fist at heaven; he
stamped, and was not horrified to find himself trampling the poor
corpse. Then he began rapidly to retrace his steps towards the house
beside the cemetery. He had forgotten all fear of the patrol, which was
long gone by at any rate, and had no idea but that of his lost purse.
It was in vain that he looked right and left upon the snow: nothing was
to be seen. He had not dropped it in the streets. Had it fallen in the
house? He would have liked dearly to go in and see; but the idea of the
grisly occupant unmanned him. And he saw besides, as he drew near, that
their efforts to put out the fire had been unsuccessful; on the
contrary, it had broken into a blaze, and a changeful light played in
the chinks of door and window, and revived his terror for the
authorities and Paris gibbet.

He returned to the hotel with the porch, and groped about upon the snow
for the money he had thrown away in his childish passion. But he could
only find one white; the other had probably struck sideways and sunk
deeply in. With a single white in his pocket, all his projects for a
rousing night in some wild tavern vanished utterly away. And it was not
only pleasure that fled laughing from his grasp; positive discomfort,
positive pain, attacked him as he stood ruefully before the porch. His
perspiration had dried upon him; and though the wind had now fallen, a
binding frost was setting in stronger with every hour, and be felt
benumbed and sick at heart. What was to be done? Late as was the hour,
improbable as was success, he would try the house of his adopted
father, the chaplain of St. Benoît.

He ran there all the way, and knocked timidly. There was no answer. He
knocked again and again, taking heart with every stroke; and at last
steps were heard approaching from within. A barred wicket fell open in
the iron-studded door, and emitted a gush of yellow light.

“Hold up your face to the wicket,” said the chaplain from within.

“It’s only me,” whimpered Villon.

“Oh, it’s only you, is it?” returned the chaplain; and he cursed him
with foul unpriestly oaths for disturbing him at such an hour, and bade
him be off to hell, where he came from.

“My hands are blue to the wrist,” pleaded Villon; “my feet are dead and
full of twinges; my nose aches with the sharp air; the cold lies at my
heart. I may be dead before morning. Only this once, father, and before
God I will never ask again!”

“You should have come earlier,” said the ecclesiastic coolly. “Young
men require a lesson now and then.” He shut the wicket and retired
deliberately into the interior of the house.

Villon was beside himself; he beat upon the door with his hands and
feet, and shouted hoarsely after the chaplain.

“Wormy old fox!” he cried. “If I had my hand under your twist, I would
send you flying headlong into the bottomless pit.”

A door shut in the interior, faintly audible to the poet down long
passages. He passed his hand over his mouth with an oath. And then the
humour of the situation struck him, and he laughed and looked lightly
up to heaven, where the stars seemed to be winking over his
discomfiture.

What was to be done? It looked very like a night in the frosty streets.
The idea of the dead woman popped into his imagination, and gave him a
hearty fright; what had happened to her in the early night might very
well happen to him before morning. And he so young! and with such
immense possibilities of disorderly amusement before him! He felt quite
pathetic over the notion of his own fate, as if it had been some one
else’s, and made a little imaginative vignette of the scene in the
morning when they should find his body.

He passed all his chances under review, turning the white between his
thumb and forefinger. Unfortunately he was on bad terms with some old
friends who would once have taken pity on him in such a plight. He had
lampooned them in verses, he had beaten and cheated them; and yet now,
when he was in so close a pinch, he thought there was at least one who
might perhaps relent. It was a chance. It was worth trying at least,
and he would go and see.

On the way, two little accidents happened to him which coloured his
musings in a very different manner. For, first, he fell in with the
track of a patrol, and walked in it for some hundred yards, although it
lay out of his direction. And this spirited him up; at least he had
confused his trail; for he was still possessed with the idea of people
tracking him all about Paris over the snow, and collaring him next
morning before he was awake. The other matter affected him very
differently. He passed a street corner, where, not so long before, a
woman and her child had been devoured by wolves. This was just the kind
of weather, he reflected, when wolves might take it into their heads to
enter Paris again; and a lone man in these deserted streets would run
the chance of something worse than a mere scare. He stopped and looked
upon the place with an unpleasant interest—it was a centre where
several lanes intersected each other; and he looked down them all one
after another, and held his breath to listen, lest he should detect
some galloping black things on the snow or hear the sound of howling
between him and the river. He remembered his mother telling him the
story and pointing out the spot, while he was yet a child. His mother!
If he only knew where she lived, he might make sure at least of
shelter. He determined he would inquire upon the morrow; nay, he would
go and see her too, poor old girl! So thinking, he arrived at his
destination—his last hope for the night.

The house was quite dark, like its neighbours; and yet after a few
taps, he heard a movement overhead, a door opening, and a cautious
voice asking who was there. The poet named himself in a loud whisper,
and waited, not without some trepidation, the result. Nor had he to
wait long. A window was suddenly opened, and a pailful of slops
splashed down upon the doorstep. Villon had not been unprepared for
something of the sort, and had put himself as much in shelter as the
nature of the porch admitted; but for all that, he was deplorably
drenched below the waist. His hose began to freeze almost at once.
Death from cold and exposure stared him in the face; he remembered he
was of phthisical tendency, and began coughing tentatively. But the
gravity of the danger steadied his nerves. He stopped a few hundred
yards from the door where he had been so rudely used, and reflected
with his finger to his nose. He could only see one way of getting a
lodging, and that was to take it. He had noticed a house not far away,
which looked as if it might be easily broken into, and thither he
betook himself promptly, entertaining himself on the way with the idea
of a room still hot, with a table still loaded with the remains of
supper, where he might pass the rest of the black hours, and whence he
should issue, on the morrow, with an armful of valuable plate. He even
considered on what viands and what wines he should prefer; and as he
was calling the roll of his favourite dainties, roast fish presented
itself to his mind with an odd mixture of amusement and horror.

“I shall never finish that ballade,” he thought to himself; and then,
with another shudder at the recollection, “Oh, damn his fat head!” he
repeated fervently, and spat upon the snow.

The house in question looked dark at first sight; but as Villon made a
preliminary inspection in search of the handiest point of attack, a
little twinkle of light caught his eye from behind a curtained window.

“The devil!” he thought. “People awake! Some student or some saint,
confound the crew! Can’t they get drunk and lie in bed snoring like
their neighbours? What’s the good of curfew, and poor devils of
bell-ringers jumping at a rope’s end in bell-towers? What’s the use of
day, if people sit up all night? The gripes to them!” He grinned as he
saw where his logic was leading him. “Every man to his business, after
all,” added he, “and if they’re awake, by the Lord, I may come by a
supper honestly for this once, and cheat the devil.”

He went boldly to the door and knocked with an assured hand. On both
previous occasions, he had knocked timidly and with some dread of
attracting notice; but now when he had just discarded the thought of a
burglarious entry, knocking at a door seemed a mighty simple and
innocent proceeding. The sound of his blows echoed through the house
with thin, phantasmal reverberations, as though it were quite empty;
but these had scarcely died away before a measured tread drew near, a
couple of bolts were withdrawn, and one wing was opened broadly, as
though no guile or fear of guile were known to those within. A tall
figure of a man, muscular and spare, but a little bent, confronted
Villon. The head was massive in bulk, but finely sculptured; the nose
blunt at the bottom, but refining upward to where it joined a pair of
strong and honest eyebrows; the mouth and eyes surrounded with delicate
markings, and the whole face based upon a thick white beard, boldly and
squarely trimmed. Seen as it was by the light of a flickering
hand-lamp, it looked perhaps nobler than it had a right to do; but it
was a fine face, honourable rather than intelligent, strong, simple,
and righteous.

“You knock late, sir,” said the old man in resonant, courteous tones.

Villon cringed, and brought up many servile words of apology; at a
crisis of this sort, the beggar was uppermost in him, and the man of
genius hid his head with confusion.

“You are cold,” repeated the old man, “and hungry? Well, step in.” And
he ordered him into the house with a noble enough gesture.

“Some great seigneur,” thought Villon, as his host, setting down the
lamp on the flagged pavement of the entry, shot the bolts once more
into their places.

“You will pardon me if I go in front,” he said, when this was done; and
he preceded the poet upstairs into a large apartment, warmed with a pan
of charcoal and lit by a great lamp hanging from the roof. It was very
bare of furniture: only some gold plate on a sideboard; some folios;
and a stand of armour between the windows. Some smart tapestry hung
upon the walls, representing the crucifixion of our Lord in one piece,
and in another a scene of shepherds and shepherdesses by a running
stream. Over the chimney was a shield of arms.

“Will you seat yourself,” said the old man, “and forgive me if I leave
you? I am alone in my house to-night, and if you are to eat I must
forage for you myself.”

No sooner was his host gone than Villon leaped from the chair on which
he had just seated himself, and began examining the room, with the
stealth and passion of a cat. He weighed the gold flagons in his hand,
opened all the folios, and investigated the arms upon the shield, and
the stuff with which the seats were lined. He raised the window
curtains, and saw that the windows were set with rich stained glass in
figures, so far as he could see, of martial import. Then he stood in
the middle of the room, drew a long breath, and retaining it with
puffed cheeks, looked round and round him, turning on his heels, as if
to impress every feature of the apartment on his memory.

“Seven pieces of plate,” he said. “If there had been ten, I would have
risked it. A fine house, and a fine old master, so help me all the
saints!”

And just then, hearing the old man’s tread returning along the
corridor, he stole back to his chair, and began humbly toasting his wet
legs before the charcoal pan.

His entertainer had a plate of meat in one hand and a jug of wine in
the other. He set down the plate upon the table, motioning Villon to
draw in his chair, and going to the sideboard, brought back two
goblets, which he filled.

“I drink to your better fortune,” he said, gravely touching Villon’s
cup with his own.

“To our better acquaintance,” said the poet, growing bold. A mere man
of the people would have been awed by the courtesy of the old seigneur,
but Villon was hardened in that matter; he had made mirth for great
lords before now, and found them as black rascals as himself. And so he
devoted himself to the viands with a ravenous gusto, while the old man,
leaning backward, watched him with steady, curious eyes.

“You have blood on your shoulder, my man,” he said. Montigny must have
laid his wet right hand upon him as he left the house. He cursed
Montigny in his heart.

“It was none of my shedding,” he stammered.

“I had not supposed so,” returned his host quietly.

“A brawl?”

“Well, something of that sort,” Villon admitted with a quaver.

“Perhaps a fellow murdered?”

“Oh no, not murdered,” said the poet, more and more confused. “It was
all fair play—murdered by accident. I had no hand in it, God strike me
dead!” he added fervently.

“One rogue the fewer, I dare say,” observed the master of the house.

“You may dare to say that,” agreed Villon, infinitely relieved. “As big
a rogue as there is between here and Jerusalem. He turned up his toes
like a lamb. But it was a nasty thing to look at. I dare say you’ve
seen dead men in your time, my lord?” he added, glancing at the armour.

“Many,” said the old man. “I have followed the wars, as you imagine.”

Villon laid down his knife and fork, which he had just taken up again.

“Were any of them bald?” he asked.

“Oh yes, and with hair as white as mine.”

“I don’t think I should mind the white so much,” said Villon. “His was
red.” And he had a return of his shuddering and tendency to laughter,
which he drowned with a great draught of wine. “I’m a little put out
when I think of it,” he went on. “I knew him—damn him! And then the
cold gives a man fancies—or the fancies give a man cold, I don’t know
which.”

“Have you any money?” asked the old man.

“I have one white,” returned the poet, laughing. “I got it out of a
dead jade’s stocking in a porch. She was as dead as Cæsar, poor wench,
and as cold as a church, with bits of ribbon sticking in her hair. This
is a hard world in winter for wolves and wenches and poor rogues like
me.”

“I,” said the old man, “am Enguerrand de la Feuillée, seigneur de
Brisetout, bailly du Patatrac. Who and what may you be?”

Villon rose and made a suitable reverence. “I am called Francis
Villon,” he said, “a poor Master of Arts of this university. I know
some Latin, and a deal of vice. I can make chansons, ballades, lais,
virelais, and roundels, and I am very fond of wine. I was born in a
garret, and I shall not improbably die upon the gallows. I may add, my
lord, that from this night forward I am your lordship’s very obsequious
servant to command.”

“No servant of mine,” said the knight; “my guest for this evening, and
no more.”

“A very grateful guest,” said Villon politely; and he drank in dumb
show to his entertainer.

“You are shrewd,” began the old man, tapping his forehead, “very
shrewd; you have learning; you are a clerk; and yet you take a small
piece of money off a dead woman in the street. Is it not a kind of
theft?”

“It is a kind of theft much practised in the wars, my lord.”

“The wars are the field of honour,” returned the old man proudly.
“There a man plays his life upon the cast; he fights in the name of his
lord the king, his Lord God, and all their lordships the holy saints
and angels.”

“Put it,” said Villon, “that I were really a thief, should I not play
my life also, and against heavier odds?”

“For gain, but not for honour.”

“Gain?” repeated Villon with a shrug. “Gain! The poor fellow wants
supper, and takes it. So does the soldier in a campaign. Why, what are
all these requisitions we hear so much about? If they are not gain to
those who take them, they are loss enough to the others. The
men-at-arms drink by a good fire, while the burgher bites his nails to
buy them wine and wood. I have seen a good many ploughmen swinging on
trees about the country, ay, I have seen thirty on one elm, and a very
poor figure they made; and when I asked some one how all these came to
be hanged, I was told it was because they could not scrape together
enough crowns to satisfy the men-at-arms.”

“These things are a necessity of war, which the low-born must endure
with constancy. It is true that some captains drive over hard; there
are spirits in every rank not easily moved by pity; and indeed many
follow arms who are no better than brigands.”

“You see,” said the poet, “you cannot separate the soldier from the
brigand; and what is a thief but an isolated brigand with circumspect
manners? I steal a couple of mutton chops, without so much as
disturbing people’s sleep; the farmer grumbles a bit, but sups none the
less wholesomely on what remains. You come up blowing gloriously on a
trumpet, take away the whole sheep, and beat the farmer pitifully into
the bargain. I have no trumpet; I am only Tom, Dick, or Harry; I am a
rogue and a dog, and hanging’s too good for me—with all my heart; but
just you ask the farmer which of us he prefers, just find out which of
us he lies awake to curse on cold nights.”

“Look at us two,” said his lordship. “I am old, strong, and honoured.
If I were turned from my house to-morrow, hundreds would be proud to
shelter me. Poor people would go out and pass the night in the streets
with their children, if I merely hinted that I wished to be alone. And
I find you up, wandering homeless, and picking farthings off dead women
by the wayside! I fear no man and nothing; I have seen you tremble and
lose countenance at a word. I wait God’s summons contentedly in my own
house, or, if it please the king to call me out again, upon the field
of battle. You look for the gallows; a rough, swift death, without hope
or honour. Is there no difference between these two?”

“As far as to the moon,” Villon acquiesced. “But if I had been born
lord of Brisetout, and you had been the poor scholar Francis, would the
difference have been any the less? Should not I have been warming my
knees at this charcoal pan, and would not you have been groping for
farthings in the snow? Should not I have been the soldier, and you the
thief?”

“A thief!” cried the old man. “I a thief! If you understood your words,
you would repent them.”

Villon turned out his hands with a gesture of inimitable impudence. “If
your lordship had done me the honour to follow my argument!” he said.

“I do you too much honour in submitting to your presence,” said the
knight. “Learn to curb your tongue when you speak with old and
honourable men, or some one hastier than I may reprove you in a sharper
fashion.” And he rose and paced the lower end of the apartment,
struggling with anger and antipathy. Villon surreptitiously refilled
his cup, and settled himself more comfortably in the chair, crossing
his knees and leaning his head upon one hand and the elbow against the
back of the chair. He was now replete and warm; and he was in nowise
frightened for his host, having gauged him as justly as was possible
between two such different characters. The night was far spent, and in
a very comfortable fashion after all; and he felt morally certain of a
safe departure on the morrow.

“Tell me one thing,” said the old man, pausing in his walk. “Are you
really a thief?”

“I claim the sacred rights of hospitality,” returned the poet. “My
lord, I am.”

“You are very young,” the knight continued.

“I should never have been so old,” replied Villon, showing his fingers,
“if I had not helped myself with these ten talents. They have been my
nursing mothers and my nursing fathers.”

“You may still repent and change.”

“I repent daily,” said the poet. “There are few people more given to
repentance than poor Francis. As for change, let somebody change my
circumstances. A man must continue to eat, if it were only that he may
continue to repent.”

“The change must begin in the heart,” returned the old man solemnly.

“My dear lord,” answered Villon, “do you really fancy that I steal for
pleasure? I hate stealing, like any other piece of work or of danger.
My teeth chatter when I see a gallows. But I must eat, I must drink, I
must mix in society of some sort. What the devil! Man is not a solitary
animal—_Cui Deus fæminam tradit_. Make me king’s pantler—make me abbot
of St. Denis; make me bailly of the Patatrac; and then I shall be
changed indeed. But as long as you leave me the poor scholar Francis
Villon, without a farthing, why, of course, I remain the same.”

“The grace of God is all-powerful.”

“I should be a heretic to question it,” said Francis. “It has made you
lord of Brisetout and bailly of the Patatrac; it has given me nothing
but the quick wits under my hat and these ten toes upon my hands. May I
help myself to wine? I thank you respectfully. By God’s grace, you have
a very superior vintage.”

The lord of Brisetout walked to and fro with his hands behind his back.
Perhaps he was not yet quite settled in his mind about the parallel
between thieves and soldiers; perhaps Villon had interested him by some
cross-thread of sympathy; perhaps his wits were simply muddled by so
much unfamiliar reasoning; but whatever the cause, he somehow yearned
to convert the young man to a better way of thinking, and could not
make up his mind to drive him forth again into the street.

“There is something more than I can understand in this,” he said at
length. “Your mouth is full of subtleties, and the devil has led you
very far astray; but the devil is only a very weak spirit before God’s
truth, and all his subtleties vanish at a word of true honour, like
darkness at morning. Listen to me once more. I learned long ago that a
gentleman should live chivalrously and lovingly to God, and the king,
and his lady; and though I have seen many strange things done, I have
still striven to command my ways upon that rule. It is not only written
in all noble histories, but in every man’s heart, if he will take care
to read. You speak of food and wine, and I know very well that hunger
is a difficult trial to endure; but you do not speak of other wants;
you say nothing of honour, of faith to God and other men, of courtesy,
of love without reproach. It may be that I am not very wise—and yet I
think I am—but you seem to me like one who has lost his way and made a
great error in life. You are attending to the little wants, and you
have totally forgotten the great and only real ones, like a man who
should be doctoring a toothache on the Judgment Day. For such things as
honour and love and faith are not only nobler than food and drink, but
indeed I think that we desire them more, and suffer more sharply for
their absence. I speak to you as I think you will most easily
understand me. Are you not, while careful to fill your belly,
disregarding another appetite in your heart, which spoils the pleasure
of your life and keeps you continually wretched?”

Villon was sensibly nettled under all this sermonising. “You think I
have no sense of honour!” he cried. “I’m poor enough, God knows! It’s
hard to see rich people with their gloves, and you blowing in your
hands. An empty belly is a bitter thing, although you speak so lightly
of it. If you had had as many as I, perhaps you would change your tune.
Any way I’m a thief—make the most of that—but I’m not a devil from
hell, God strike me dead. I would have you to know I’ve an honour of my
own, as good as yours, though I don’t prate about it all day long, as
if it was a God’s miracle to have any. It seems quite natural to me; I
keep it in its box till it’s wanted. Why now, look you here, how long
have I been in this room with you? Did you not tell me you were alone
in the house? Look at your gold plate! You’re strong, if you like, but
you’re old and unarmed, and I have my knife. What did I want but a jerk
of the elbow and here would have been you with the cold steel in your
bowels, and there would have been me, linking in the streets, with an
armful of gold cups! Did you suppose I hadn’t wit enough to see that?
And I scorned the action. There are your damned goblets, as safe as in
a church; there are you, with your heart ticking as good as new; and
here am I, ready to go out again as poor as I came in, with my one
white that you threw in my teeth! And you think I have no sense of
honour—God strike me dead!”

The old man stretched out his right arm. “I will tell you what you
are,” he said. “You are a rogue, my man, an impudent and a
black-hearted rogue and vagabond. I have passed an hour with you. Oh!
believe me, I feel myself disgraced! And you have eaten and drunk at my
table. But now I am sick at your presence; the day has come, and the
night-bird should be off to his roost. Will you go before, or after?”

“Which you please,” returned the poet, rising. “I believe you to be
strictly honourable.” He thoughtfully emptied his cup. “I wish I could
add you were intelligent,” he went on, knocking on his head with his
knuckles. “Age, age! the brains stiff and rheumatic.”

The old man preceded him from a point of self-respect; Villon followed,
whistling, with his thumbs in his girdle.

“God pity you,” said the lord of Brisetout at the door.

“Good-bye, papa,” returned Villon with a yawn. “Many thanks for the
cold mutton.”

The door closed behind him. The dawn was breaking over the white roofs.
A chill, uncomfortable morning ushered in the day. Villon stood and
heartily stretched himself in the middle of the road.

“A very dull old gentleman,” he thought. “I wonder what his goblets may
be worth.”




THE SIRE DE MALÉTROIT’S DOOR


Denis de Beaulieu was not yet two-and-twenty, but he counted himself a
grown man, and a very accomplished cavalier into the bargain. Lads were
early formed in that rough, warfaring epoch; and when one has been in a
pitched battle and a dozen raids, has killed one’s man in an honourable
fashion, and knows a thing or two of strategy and mankind, a certain
swagger in the gait is surely to be pardoned. He had put up his horse
with due care, and supped with due deliberation; and then, in a very
agreeable frame of mind, went out to pay a visit in the grey of the
evening. It was not a very wise proceeding on the young man’s part. He
would have done better to remain beside the fire or go decently to bed.
For the town was full of the troops of Burgundy and England under a
mixed command; and though Denis was there on safe-conduct, his
safe-conduct was like to serve him little on a chance encounter.

It was September 1429; the weather had fallen sharp; a flighty piping
wind, laden with showers, beat about the township; and the dead leaves
ran riot along the streets. Here and there a window was already lighted
up; and the noise of men-at-arms making merry over supper within, came
forth in fits and was swallowed up and carried away by the wind. The
night fell swiftly; the flag of England, fluttering on the spire-top,
grew ever fainter and fainter against the flying clouds—a black speck
like a swallow in the tumultuous, leaden chaos of the sky. As the night
fell the wind rose, and began to hoot under archways and roar amid the
tree-tops in the valley below the town.

Denis de Beaulieu walked fast and was soon knocking at his friend’s
door; but though he promised himself to stay only a little while and
make an early return, his welcome was so pleasant, and he found so much
to delay him, that it was already long past midnight before he said
good-bye upon the threshold. The wind had fallen again in the
meanwhile; the night was as black as the grave; not a star, nor a
glimmer of moonshine, slipped through the canopy of cloud. Denis was
ill-acquainted with the intricate lanes of Chateau Landon; even by
daylight he had found some trouble in picking his way; and in this
absolute darkness he soon lost it altogether. He was certain of one
thing only—to keep mounting the hill; for his friend’s house lay at the
lower end, or tail, of Chateau Landon, while the inn was up at the
head, under the great church spire. With this clue to go upon he
stumbled and groped forward, now breathing more freely in open places
where there was a good slice of sky overhead, now feeling along the
wall in stifling closes. It is an eerie and mysterious position to be
thus submerged in opaque blackness in an almost unknown town. The
silence is terrifying in its possibilities. The touch of cold window
bars to the exploring hand startles the man like the touch of a toad;
the inequalities of the pavement shake his heart into his mouth; a
piece of denser darkness threatens an ambuscade or a chasm in the
pathway; and where the air is brighter, the houses put on strange and
bewildering appearances, as if to lead him farther from his way. For
Denis, who had to regain his inn without attracting notice, there was
real danger as well as mere discomfort in the walk; and he went warily
and boldly at once, and at every corner paused to make an observation.

He had been for some time threading a lane so narrow that he could
touch a wall with either hand, when it began to open out and go sharply
downward. Plainly this lay no longer in the direction of his inn; but
the hope of a little more light tempted him forward to reconnoitre. The
lane ended in a terrace with a bartizan wall, which gave an out-look
between high houses, as out of an embrasure, into the valley lying dark
and formless several hundred feet below. Denis looked down, and could
discern a few tree-tops waving and a single speck of brightness where
the river ran across a weir. The weather was clearing up, and the sky
had lightened, so as to show the outline of the heavier clouds and the
dark margin of the hills. By the uncertain glimmer, the house on his
left hand should be a place of some pretensions; it was surmounted by
several pinnacles and turret-tops; the round stern of a chapel, with a
fringe of flying buttresses, projected boldly from the main block; and
the door was sheltered under a deep porch carved with figures and
overhung by two long gargoyles. The windows of the chapel gleamed
through their intricate tracery with a light as of many tapers, and
threw out the buttresses and the peaked roof in a more intense
blackness against the sky. It was plainly the hotel of some great
family of the neighbourhood; and as it reminded Denis of a town house
of his own at Bourges, he stood for some time gazing up at it and
mentally gauging the skill of the architects and the consideration of
the two families.

There seemed to be no issue to the terrace but the lane by which he had
reached it; he could only retrace his steps, but he had gained some
notion of his whereabouts, and hoped by this means to hit the main
thoroughfare and speedily regain the inn. He was reckoning without that
chapter of accidents which was to make this night memorable above all
others in his career; for he had not gone back above a hundred yards
before he saw a light coming to meet him, and heard loud voices
speaking together in the echoing narrows of the lane. It was a party of
men-at-arms going the night round with torches. Denis assured himself
that they had all been making free with the wine-bowl, and were in no
mood to be particular about safe-conducts or the niceties of chivalrous
war. It was as like as not that they would kill him like a dog and
leave him where he fell. The situation was inspiriting but nervous.
Their own torches would conceal him from sight, he reflected; and he
hoped that they would drown the noise of his footsteps with their own
empty voices. If he were but fleet and silent, he might evade their
notice altogether.

Unfortunately, as he turned to beat a retreat, his foot rolled upon a
pebble; he fell against the wall with an ejaculation, and his sword
rang loudly on the stones. Two or three voices demanded who went
there—some in French, some in English; but Denis made no reply, and ran
the faster down the lane. Once upon the terrace, he paused to look
back. They still kept calling after him, and just then began to double
the pace in pursuit, with a considerable clank of armour, and great
tossing of the torchlight to and fro in the narrow jaws of the passage.

Denis cast a look around and darted into the porch. There he might
escape observation, or—if that were too much to expect—was in a capital
posture whether for parley or defence. So thinking, he drew his sword
and tried to set his back against the door. To his surprise, it yielded
behind his weight; and though he turned in a moment, continued to swing
back on oiled and noiseless hinges, until it stood wide open on a black
interior. When things fall out opportunely for the person concerned, he
is not apt to be critical about the how or why, his own immediate
personal convenience seeming a sufficient reason for the strangest
oddities and resolutions in our sublunary things; and so Denis, without
a moment’s hesitation, stepped within and partly closed the door behind
him to conceal his place of refuge. Nothing was further from his
thoughts than to close it altogether; but for some inexplicable
reason—perhaps by a spring or a weight—the ponderous mass of oak
whipped itself out of his fingers and clanked to, with a formidable
rumble and a noise like the falling of an automatic bar.

The round, at that very moment, debouched upon the terrace and
proceeded to summon him with shouts and curses. He heard them ferreting
in the dark corners; the stock of a lance even rattled along the outer
surface of the door behind which he stood; but these gentlemen were in
too high a humour to be long delayed, and soon made off down a
corkscrew pathway which had escaped Denis’s observation, and passed out
of sight and hearing along the battlements of the town.

Denis breathed again. He gave them a few minutes’ grace for fear of
accidents, and then groped about for some means of opening the door and
slipping forth again. The inner surface was quite smooth, not a handle,
not a moulding, not a projection of any sort. He got his finger-nails
round the edges and pulled, but the mass was immovable. He shook it, it
was as firm as a rock. Denis de Beaulieu frowned and gave vent to a
little noiseless whistle. What ailed the door? he wondered. Why was it
open? How came it to shut so easily and so effectually after him? There
was something obscure and underhand about all this, that was little to
the young man’s fancy. It looked like a snare; and yet who could
suppose a snare in such a quiet by-street and in a house of so
prosperous and even noble an exterior? And yet—snare or no snare,
intentionally or unintentionally—here he was, prettily trapped; and for
the life of him he could see no way out of it again. The darkness began
to weigh upon him. He gave ear; all was silent without, but within and
close by he seemed to catch a faint sighing, a faint sobbing rustle, a
little stealthy creak—as though many persons were at his side, holding
themselves quite still, and governing even their respiration with the
extreme of slyness. The idea went to his vitals with a shock, and he
faced about suddenly as if to defend his life. Then, for the first
time, he became aware of a light about the level of his eyes and at
some distance in the interior of the house—a vertical thread of light,
widening towards the bottom, such as might escape between two wings of
arras over a doorway. To see anything was a relief to Denis; it was
like a piece of solid ground to a man labouring in a morass; his mind
seized upon it with avidity; and he stood staring at it and trying to
piece together some logical conception of his surroundings. Plainly
there was a flight of steps ascending from his own level to that of
this illuminated doorway; and indeed he thought he could make out
another thread of light, as fine as a needle and as faint as
phosphorescence, which might very well be reflected along the polished
wood of a handrail. Since he had begun to suspect that he was not
alone, his heart had continued to beat with smothering violence, and an
intolerable desire for action of any sort had possessed itself of his
spirit. He was in deadly peril, he believed. What could be more natural
than to mount the staircase, lift the curtain, and confront his
difficulty at once? At least he would be dealing with something
tangible; at least he would be no longer in the dark. He stepped slowly
forward with outstretched hands, until his foot struck the bottom step;
then he rapidly scaled the stairs, stood for a moment to compose his
expression, lifted the arras and went in.

He found himself in a large apartment of polished stone. There were
three doors; one on each of three sides; all similarly curtained with
tapestry. The fourth side was occupied by two large windows and a great
stone chimney-piece, carved with the arms of the Malétroits. Denis
recognised the bearings, and was gratified to find himself in such good
hands. The room was strongly illuminated; but it contained little
furniture except a heavy table and a chair or two, the hearth was
innocent of fire, and the pavement was but sparsely strewn with rushes
clearly many days old.

On a high chair beside the chimney, and directly facing Denis as he
entered, sat a little old gentleman in a fur tippet. He sat with his
legs crossed and his hands folded, and a cup of spiced wine stood by
his elbow on a bracket on the wall. His countenance had a strongly
masculine cast; not properly human, but such as we see in the bull, the
goat, or the domestic boar; something equivocal and wheedling,
something greedy, brutal, and dangerous. The upper lip was inordinately
full, as though swollen by a blow or a toothache; and the smile, the
peaked eyebrows, and the small, strong eyes were quaintly and almost
comically evil in expression. Beautiful white hair hung straight all
round his head, like a saint’s, and fell in a single curl upon the
tippet. His beard and moustache were the pink of venerable sweetness.
Age, probably in consequence of inordinate precautions, had left no
mark upon his hands; and the Malétroit hand was famous. It would be
difficult to imagine anything at once so fleshy and so delicate in
design; the taper, sensual fingers were like those of one of Leonardo’s
women; the fork of the thumb made a dimpled protuberance when closed;
the nails were perfectly shaped, and of a dead, surprising whiteness.
It rendered his aspect tenfold more redoubtable, that a man with hands
like these should keep them devoutly folded in his lap like a virgin
martyr—that a man with so intense and startling an expression of face
should sit patiently on his seat and contemplate people with an
unwinking stare, like a god, or a god’s statue. His quiescence seemed
ironical and treacherous, it fitted so poorly with his looks.

Such was Alain, Sire de Malétroit.

Denis and he looked silently at each other for a second or two.

“Pray step in,” said the Sire de Malétroit. “I have been expecting you
all the evening.”

He had not risen, but he accompanied his words with a smile and a
slight but courteous inclination of the head. Partly from the smile,
partly from the strange musical murmur with which the Sire prefaced his
observation, Denis felt a strong shudder of disgust go through his
marrow. And what with disgust and honest confusion of mind, he could
scarcely get words together in reply.

“I fear,” he said, “that this is a double accident. I am not the person
you suppose me. It seems you were looking for a visit; but for my part,
nothing was further from my thoughts—nothing could be more contrary to
my wishes—than this intrusion.”

“Well, well,” replied the old gentleman indulgently, “here you are,
which is the main point. Seat yourself, my friend, and put yourself
entirely at your ease. We shall arrange our little affairs presently.”

Denis perceived that the matter was still complicated with some
misconception, and he hastened to continue his explanations.

“Your door . . . ” he began.

“About my door?” asked the other, raising his peaked eyebrows. “A
little piece of ingenuity.” And he shrugged his shoulders. “A
hospitable fancy! By your own account, you were not desirous of making
my acquaintance. We old people look for such reluctance now and then;
and when it touches our honour, we cast about until we find some way of
overcoming it. You arrive uninvited, but believe me, very welcome.”

“You persist in error, sir,” said Denis. “There can be no question
between you and me. I am a stranger in this countryside. My name is
Denis, damoiseau de Beaulieu. If you see me in your house, it is only—”

“My young friend,” interrupted the other, “you will permit me to have
my own ideas on that subject. They probably differ from yours at the
present moment,” he added with a leer, “but time will show which of us
is in the right.”

Denis was convinced he had to do with a lunatic. He seated himself with
a shrug, content to wait the upshot; and a pause ensued, during which
he thought he could distinguish a hurried gabbling as of prayer from
behind the arras immediately opposite him. Sometimes there seemed to be
but one person engaged, sometimes two; and the vehemence of the voice,
low as it was, seemed to indicate either great haste or an agony of
spirit. It occurred to him that this piece of tapestry covered the
entrance to the chapel he had noticed from without.

The old gentleman meanwhile surveyed Denis from head to foot with a
smile, and from time to time emitted little noises like a bird or a
mouse, which seemed to indicate a high degree of satisfaction. This
state of matters became rapidly insupportable; and Denis, to put an end
to it, remarked politely that the wind had gone down.

The old gentleman fell into a fit of silent laughter, so prolonged and
violent that he became quite red in the face. Denis got upon his feet
at once, and put on his hat with a flourish.

“Sir,” he said, “if you are in your wits, you have affronted me
grossly. If you are out of them, I flatter myself I can find better
employment for my brains than to talk with lunatics. My conscience is
clear; you have made a fool of me from the first moment; you have
refused to hear my explanations; and now there is no power under God
will make me stay here any longer; and if I cannot make my way out in a
more decent fashion, I will hack your door in pieces with my sword.”

The Sire de Malétroit raised his right hand and wagged it at Denis with
the fore and little fingers extended.

“My dear nephew,” he said, “sit down.”

“Nephew!” retorted Denis, “you lie in your throat;” and he snapped his
fingers in his face.

“Sit down, you rogue!” cried the old gentleman, in a sudden, harsh
voice, like the barking of a dog. “Do you fancy,” he went on, “that
when I had made my little contrivance for the door I had stopped short
with that? If you prefer to be bound hand and foot till your bones
ache, rise and try to go away. If you choose to remain a free young
buck, agreeably conversing with an old gentleman—why, sit where you are
in peace, and God be with you.”

“Do you mean I am a prisoner?” demanded Denis.

“I state the facts,” replied the other. “I would rather leave the
conclusion to yourself.”

Denis sat down again. Externally he managed to keep pretty calm; but
within, he was now boiling with anger, now chilled with apprehension.
He no longer felt convinced that he was dealing with a madman. And if
the old gentleman was sane, what, in God’s name, had he to look for?
What absurd or tragical adventure had befallen him? What countenance
was he to assume?

While he was thus unpleasantly reflecting, the arras that overhung the
chapel door was raised, and a tall priest in his robes came forth and,
giving a long, keen stare at Denis, said something in an undertone to
Sire de Malétroit.

“She is in a better frame of spirit?” asked the latter.

“She is more resigned, messire,” replied the priest.

“Now the Lord help her, she is hard to please!” sneered the old
gentleman. “A likely stripling—not ill-born—and of her own choosing,
too? Why, what more would the jade have?”

“The situation is not usual for a young damsel,” said the other, “and
somewhat trying to her blushes.”

“She should have thought of that before she began the dance. It was
none of my choosing, God knows that: but since she is in it, by our
Lady, she shall carry it to the end.” And then addressing Denis,
“Monsieur de Beaulieu,” he asked, “may I present you to my niece? She
has been waiting your arrival, I may say, with even greater impatience
than myself.”

Denis had resigned himself with a good grace—all he desired was to know
the worst of it as speedily as possible; so he rose at once, and bowed
in acquiescence. The Sire de Malétroit followed his example and limped,
with the assistance of the chaplain’s arm, towards the chapel door. The
priest pulled aside the arras, and all three entered. The building had
considerable architectural pretensions. A light groining sprang from
six stout columns, and hung down in two rich pendants from the centre
of the vault. The place terminated behind the altar in a round end,
embossed and honeycombed with a superfluity of ornament in relief, and
pierced by many little windows shaped like stars, trefoils, or wheels.
These windows were imperfectly glazed, so that the night air circulated
freely in the chapel. The tapers, of which there must have been half a
hundred burning on the altar, were unmercifully blown about; and the
light went through many different phases of brilliancy and
semi-eclipse. On the steps in front of the altar knelt a young girl
richly attired as a bride. A chill settled over Denis as he observed
her costume; he fought with desperate energy against the conclusion
that was being thrust upon his mind; it could not—it should not—be as
he feared.

“Blanche,” said the Sire, in his most flute-like tones, “I have brought
a friend to see you, my little girl; turn round and give him your
pretty hand. It is good to be devout; but it is necessary to be polite,
my niece.”

The girl rose to her feet and turned towards the new comers. She moved
all of a piece; and shame and exhaustion were expressed in every line
of her fresh young body; and she held her head down and kept her eyes
upon the pavement, as she came slowly forward. In the course of her
advance, her eyes fell upon Denis de Beaulieu’s feet—feet of which he
was justly vain, be it remarked, and wore in the most elegant
accoutrement even while travelling. She paused—started, as if his
yellow boots had conveyed some shocking meaning—and glanced suddenly up
into the wearer’s countenance. Their eyes met; shame gave place to
horror and terror in her looks; the blood left her lips; with a
piercing scream she covered her face with her hands and sank upon the
chapel floor.

“That is not the man!” she cried. “My uncle, that in not the man!”

The Sire de Malétroit chirped agreeably. “Of course not,” he said; “I
expected as much. It was so unfortunate you could not remember his
name.”

“Indeed,” she cried, “indeed, I have never seen this person till this
moment—I have never so much as set eyes upon him—I never wish to see
him again. Sir,” she said, turning to Denis, “if you are a gentleman,
you will bear me out. Have I ever seen you—have you ever seen me—before
this accursed hour?”

“To speak for myself, I have never had that pleasure,” answered the
young man. “This is the first time, messire, that I have met with your
engaging niece.”

The old gentleman shrugged his shoulders.

“I am distressed to hear it,” he said. “But it is never too late to
begin. I had little more acquaintance with my own late lady ere I
married her; which proves,” he added with a grimace, “that these
impromptu marriages may often produce an excellent understanding in the
long-run. As the bridegroom is to have a voice in the matter, I will
give him two hours to make up for lost time before we proceed with the
ceremony.” And he turned towards the door, followed by the clergyman.

The girl was on her feet in a moment. “My uncle, you cannot be in
earnest,” she said. “I declare before God I will stab myself rather
than be forced on that young man. The heart rises at it; God forbids
such marriages; you dishonour your white hair. Oh, my uncle, pity me!
There is not a woman in all the world but would prefer death to such a
nuptial. Is it possible,” she added, faltering—“is it possible that you
do not believe me—that you still think this”—and she pointed at Denis
with a tremor of anger and contempt—“that you still think _this_ to be
the man?”

“Frankly,” said the old gentleman, pausing on the threshold, “I do. But
let me explain to you once for all, Blanche de Malétroit, my way of
thinking about this affair. When you took it into your head to
dishonour my family and the name that I have borne, in peace and war,
for more than three-score years, you forfeited, not only the right to
question my designs, but that of looking me in the face. If your father
had been alive, he would have spat on you and turned you out of doors.
His was the hand of iron. You may bless your God you have only to deal
with the hand of velvet, mademoiselle. It was my duty to get you
married without delay. Out of pure goodwill, I have tried to find your
own gallant for you. And I believe I have succeeded. But before God and
all the holy angels, Blanche de Malétroit, if I have not, I care not
one jack-straw. So let me recommend you to be polite to our young
friend; for upon my word, your next groom may be less appetising.”

And with that he went out, with the chaplain at his heels; and the
arras fell behind the pair.

The girl turned upon Denis with flashing eyes.

“And what, sir,” she demanded, “may be the meaning of all this?”

“God knows,” returned Denis gloomily. “I am a prisoner in this house,
which seems full of mad people. More I know not; and nothing do I
understand.”

“And pray how came you here?” she asked.

He told her as briefly as he could. “For the rest,” he added, “perhaps
you will follow my example, and tell me the answer to all these
riddles, and what, in God’s name, is like to be the end of it.”

She stood silent for a little, and he could see her lips tremble and
her tearless eyes burn with a feverish lustre. Then she pressed her
forehead in both hands.

“Alas, how my head aches!” she said wearily—“to say nothing of my poor
heart! But it is due to you to know my story, unmaidenly as it must
seem. I am called Blanche de Malétroit; I have been without father or
mother for—oh! for as long as I can recollect, and indeed I have been
most unhappy all my life. Three months ago a young captain began to
stand near me every day in church. I could see that I pleased him; I am
much to blame, but I was so glad that any one should love me; and when
he passed me a letter, I took it home with me and read it with great
pleasure. Since that time he has written many. He was so anxious to
speak with me, poor fellow! and kept asking me to leave the door open
some evening that we might have two words upon the stair. For he knew
how much my uncle trusted me.” She gave something like a sob at that,
and it was a moment before she could go on. “My uncle is a hard man,
but he is very shrewd,” she said at last. “He has performed many feats
in war, and was a great person at court, and much trusted by Queen
Isabeau in old days. How he came to suspect me I cannot tell; but it is
hard to keep anything from his knowledge; and this morning, as we came
from mass, he took my hand in his, forced it open, and read my little
billet, walking by my side all the while. When he had finished, he gave
it back to me with great politeness. It contained another request to
have the door left open; and this has been the ruin of us all. My uncle
kept me strictly in my room until evening, and then ordered me to dress
myself as you see me—a hard mockery for a young girl, do you not think
so? I suppose, when he could not prevail with me to tell him the young
captain’s name, he must have laid a trap for him: into which, alas! you
have fallen in the anger of God. I looked for much confusion; for how
could I tell whether he was willing to take me for his wife on these
sharp terms? He might have been trifling with me from the first; or I
might have made myself too cheap in his eyes. But truly I had not
looked for such a shameful punishment as this! I could not think that
God would let a girl be so disgraced before a young man. And now I have
told you all; and I can scarcely hope that you will not despise me.”

Denis made her a respectful inclination.

“Madam,” he said, “you have honoured me by your confidence. It remains
for me to prove that I am not unworthy of the honour. Is Messire de
Malétroit at hand?”

“I believe he is writing in the salle without,” she answered.

“May I lead you thither, madam?” asked Denis, offering his hand with
his most courtly bearing.

She accepted it; and the pair passed out of the chapel, Blanche in a
very drooping and shamefast condition, but Denis strutting and ruffling
in the consciousness of a mission, and the boyish certainty of
accomplishing it with honour.

The Sire de Malétroit rose to meet them with an ironical obeisance.

“Sir,” said Denis, with the grandest possible air, “I believe I am to
have some say in the matter of this marriage; and let me tell you at
once, I will be no party to forcing the inclination of this young lady.
Had it been freely offered to me, I should have been proud to accept
her hand, for I perceive she is as good as she is beautiful; but as
things are, I have now the honour, messire, of refusing.”

Blanche looked at him with gratitude in her eyes; but the old gentleman
only smiled and smiled, until his smile grew positively sickening to
Denis.

“I am afraid,” he said, “Monsieur de Beaulieu, that you do not
perfectly understand the choice I have to offer you. Follow me, I
beseech you, to this window.” And he led the way to one of the large
windows which stood open on the night. “You observe,” he went on,
“there is an iron ring in the upper masonry, and reeved through that, a
very efficacious rope. Now, mark my words; if you should find your
disinclination to my niece’s person insurmountable, I shall have you
hanged out of this window before sunrise. I shall only proceed to such
an extremity with the greatest regret, you may believe me. For it is
not at all your death that I desire, but my niece’s establishment in
life. At the same time, it must come to that if you prove obstinate.
Your family, Monsieur de Beaulieu, is very well in its way; but if you
sprang from Charlemagne, you should not refuse the hand of a Malétroit
with impunity—not if she had been as common as the Paris road—not if
she were as hideous as the gargoyle over my door. Neither my niece nor
you, nor my own private feelings, move me at all in this matter. The
honour of my house has been compromised; I believe you to be the guilty
person; at least you are now in the secret; and you can hardly wonder
if I request you to wipe out the stain. If you will not, your blood be
on your own head! It will be no great satisfaction to me to have your
interesting relics kicking their heels in the breeze below my windows;
but half a loaf is better than no bread, and if I cannot cure the
dishonour, I shall at least stop the scandal.”

There was a pause.

“I believe there are other ways of settling such imbroglios among
gentlemen,” said Denis. “You wear a sword, and I hear you have used it
with distinction.”

The Sire de Malétroit made a signal to the chaplain, who crossed the
room with long silent strides and raised the arras over the third of
the three doors. It was only a moment before he let it fall again; but
Denis had time to see a dusky passage full of armed men.

“When I was a little younger, I should have been delighted to honour
you, Monsieur de Beaulieu,” said Sire Alain; “but I am now too old.
Faithful retainers are the sinews of age, and I must employ the
strength I have. This is one of the hardest things to swallow as a man
grows up in years; but with a little patience, even this becomes
habitual. You and the lady seem to prefer the salle for what remains of
your two hours; and as I have no desire to cross your preference, I
shall resign it to your use with all the pleasure in the world. No
haste!” he added, holding up his hand, as he saw a dangerous look come
into Denis de Beaulieu’s face. “If your mind revolts against hanging,
it will be time enough two hours hence to throw yourself out of the
window or upon the pikes of my retainers. Two hours of life are always
two hours. A great many things may turn up in even as little a while as
that. And, besides, if I understand her appearance, my niece has still
something to say to you. You will not disfigure your last hours by a
want of politeness to a lady?”

Denis looked at Blanche, and she made him an imploring gesture.

It is likely that the old gentleman was hugely pleased at this symptom
of an understanding; for he smiled on both, and added sweetly: “If you
will give me your word of honour, Monsieur de Beaulieu, to await my
return at the end of the two hours before attempting anything
desperate, I shall withdraw my retainers, and let you speak in greater
privacy with mademoiselle.”

Denis again glanced at the girl, who seemed to beseech him to agree.

“I give you my word of honour,” he said.

Messire de Malétroit bowed, and proceeded to limp about the apartment,
clearing his throat the while with that odd musical chirp which had
already grown so irritating in the ears of Denis de Beaulieu. He first
possessed himself of some papers which lay upon the table; then he went
to the mouth of the passage and appeared to give an order to the men
behind the arras; and lastly he hobbled out through the door by which
Denis had come in, turning upon the threshold to address a last smiling
bow to the young couple, and followed by the chaplain with a hand-lamp.

No sooner were they alone than Blanche advanced towards Denis with her
hands extended. Her face was flushed and excited, and her eyes shone
with tears.

“You shall not die!” she cried, “you shall marry me after all.”

“You seem to think, madam,” replied Denis, “that I stand much in fear
of death.”

“Oh no, no,” she said, “I see you are no poltroon. It is for my own
sake—I could not bear to have you slain for such a scruple.”

“I am afraid,” returned Denis, “that you underrate the difficulty,
madam. What you may be too generous to refuse, I may be too proud to
accept. In a moment of noble feeling towards me, you forgot what you
perhaps owe to others.”

He had the decency to keep his eyes upon the floor as he said this, and
after he had finished, so as not to spy upon her confusion. She stood
silent for a moment, then walked suddenly away, and falling on her
uncle’s chair, fairly burst out sobbing. Denis was in the acme of
embarrassment. He looked round, as if to seek for inspiration, and
seeing a stool, plumped down upon it for something to do. There he sat,
playing with the guard of his rapier, and wishing himself dead a
thousand times over, and buried in the nastiest kitchen-heap in France.
His eyes wandered round the apartment, but found nothing to arrest
them. There were such wide spaces between the furniture, the light fell
so baldly and cheerlessly over all, the dark outside air looked in so
coldly through the windows, that he thought he had never seen a church
so vast, nor a tomb so melancholy. The regular sobs of Blanche de
Malétroit measured out the time like the ticking of a clock. He read
the device upon the shield over and over again, until his eyes became
obscured; he stared into shadowy corners until he imagined they were
swarming with horrible animals; and every now and again he awoke with a
start, to remember that his last two hours were running, and death was
on the march.

Oftener and oftener, as the time went on, did his glance settle on the
girl herself. Her face was bowed forward and covered with her hands,
and she was shaken at intervals by the convulsive hiccup of grief. Even
thus she was not an unpleasant object to dwell upon, so plump and yet
so fine, with a warm brown skin, and the most beautiful hair, Denis
thought, in the whole world of womankind. Her hands were like her
uncle’s; but they were more in place at the end of her young arms, and
looked infinitely soft and caressing. He remembered how her blue eyes
had shone upon him, full of anger, pity, and innocence. And the more he
dwelt on her perfections, the uglier death looked, and the more deeply
was he smitten with penitence at her continued tears. Now he felt that
no man could have the courage to leave a world which contained so
beautiful a creature; and now he would have given forty minutes of his
last hour to have unsaid his cruel speech.

Suddenly a hoarse and ragged peal of cockcrow rose to their ears from
the dark valley below the windows. And this shattering noise in the
silence of all around was like a light in a dark place, and shook them
both out of their reflections.

“Alas, can I do nothing to help you?” she said, looking up.

“Madam,” replied Denis, with a fine irrelevancy, “if I have said
anything to wound you, believe me, it was for your own sake and not for
mine.”

She thanked him with a tearful look.

“I feel your position cruelly,” he went on. “The world has been bitter
hard on you. Your uncle is a disgrace to mankind. Believe me, madam,
there is no young gentleman in all France but would be glad of my
opportunity, to die in doing you a momentary service.”

“I know already that you can be very brave and generous,” she answered.
“What I _want_ to know is whether I can serve you—now or afterwards,”
she added, with a quaver.

“Most certainly,” he answered with a smile. “Let me sit beside you as
if I were a friend, instead of a foolish intruder; try to forget how
awkwardly we are placed to one another; make my last moments go
pleasantly; and you will do me the chief service possible.”

“You are very gallant,” she added, with a yet deeper sadness . . .
“very gallant . . . and it somehow pains me. But draw nearer, if you
please; and if you find anything to say to me, you will at least make
certain of a very friendly listener. Ah! Monsieur de Beaulieu,” she
broke forth—“ah! Monsieur de Beaulieu, how can I look you in the face?”
And she fell to weeping again with a renewed effusion.

“Madam,” said Denis, taking her hand in both of his, “reflect on the
little time I have before me, and the great bitterness into which I am
cast by the sight of your distress. Spare me, in my last moments, the
spectacle of what I cannot cure even with the sacrifice of my life.”

“I am very selfish,” answered Blanche. “I will be braver, Monsieur de
Beaulieu, for your sake. But think if I can do you no kindness in the
future—if you have no friends to whom I could carry your adieux. Charge
me as heavily as you can; every burden will lighten, by so little, the
invaluable gratitude I owe you. Put it in my power to do something more
for you than weep.”

“My mother is married again, and has a young family to care for. My
brother Guichard will inherit my fiefs; and if I am not in error, that
will content him amply for my death. Life is a little vapour that
passeth away, as we are told by those in holy orders. When a man is in
a fair way and sees all life open in front of him, he seems to himself
to make a very important figure in the world. His horse whinnies to
him; the trumpets blow and the girls look out of window as he rides
into town before his company; he receives many assurances of trust and
regard—sometimes by express in a letter—sometimes face to face, with
persons of great consequence falling on his neck. It is not wonderful
if his head is turned for a time. But once he is dead, were he as brave
as Hercules or as wise as Solomon, he is soon forgotten. It is not ten
years since my father fell, with many other knights around him, in a
very fierce encounter, and I do not think that any one of them, nor so
much as the name of the fight, is now remembered. No, no, madam, the
nearer you come to it, you see that death is a dark and dusty corner,
where a man gets into his tomb and has the door shut after him till the
judgment day. I have few friends just now, and once I am dead I shall
have none.”

“Ah, Monsieur de Beaulieu!” she exclaimed, “you forget Blanche de
Malétroit.”

“You have a sweet nature, madam, and you are pleased to estimate a
little service far beyond its worth.”

“It is not that,” she answered. “You mistake me if you think I am so
easily touched by my own concerns. I say so, because you are the
noblest man I have ever met; because I recognise in you a spirit that
would have made even a common person famous in the land.”

“And yet here I die in a mouse-trap—with no more noise about it than my
own squeaking,” answered he.

A look of pain crossed her face, and she was silent for a little while.
Then a fight came into her eyes, and with a smile she spoke again.

“I cannot have my champion think meanly of himself. Any one who gives
his life for another will be met in Paradise by all the heralds and
angels of the Lord God. And you have no such cause to hang your head.
For . . . Pray, do you think me beautiful?” she asked, with a deep
flush.

“Indeed, madam, I do,” he said.

“I am glad of that,” she answered heartily. “Do you think there are
many men in France who have been asked in marriage by a beautiful
maiden—with her own lips—and who have refused her to her face? I know
you men would half despise such a triumph; but believe me, we women
know more of what is precious in love. There is nothing that should set
a person higher in his own esteem; and we women would prize nothing
more dearly.”

“You are very good,” he said; “but you cannot make me forget that I was
asked in pity and not for love.”

“I am not so sure of that,” she replied, holding down her head. “Hear
me to an end, Monsieur de Beaulieu. I know how you must despise me; I
feel you are right to do so; I am too poor a creature to occupy one
thought of your mind, although, alas! you must die for me this morning.
But when I asked you to marry me, indeed, and indeed, it was because I
respected and admired you, and loved you with my whole soul, from the
very moment that you took my part against my uncle. If you had seen
yourself, and how noble you looked, you would pity rather than despise
me. And now,” she went on, hurriedly checking him with her hand,
“although I have laid aside all reserve and told you so much, remember
that I know your sentiments towards me already. I would not, believe
me, being nobly born, weary you with importunities into consent. I too
have a pride of my own: and I declare before the holy mother of God, if
you should now go back from your word already given, I would no more
marry you than I would marry my uncle’s groom.”

Denis smiled a little bitterly.

“It is a small love,” he said, “that shies at a little pride.”

She made no answer, although she probably had her own thoughts.

“Come hither to the window,” he said, with a sigh. “Here is the dawn.”

And indeed the dawn was already beginning. The hollow of the sky was
full of essential daylight, colourless and clean; and the valley
underneath was flooded with a grey reflection. A few thin vapours clung
in the coves of the forest or lay along the winding course of the
river. The scene disengaged a surprising effect of stillness, which was
hardly interrupted when the cocks began once more to crow among the
steadings. Perhaps the same fellow who had made so horrid a clangour in
the darkness not half-an-hour before, now sent up the merriest cheer to
greet the coming day. A little wind went bustling and eddying among the
tree-tops underneath the windows. And still the daylight kept flooding
insensibly out of the east, which was soon to grow incandescent and
cast up that red-hot cannon-ball, the rising sun.

Denis looked out over all this with a bit of a shiver. He had taken her
hand, and retained it in his almost unconsciously.

“Has the day begun already?” she said; and then, illogically enough:
“the night has been so long! Alas, what shall we say to my uncle when
he returns?”

“What you will,” said Denis, and he pressed her fingers in his.

She was silent.

“Blanche,” he said, with a swift, uncertain, passionate utterance, “you
have seen whether I fear death. You must know well enough that I would
as gladly leap out of that window into the empty air as lay a finger on
you without your free and full consent. But if you care for me at all
do not let me lose my life in a misapprehension; for I love you better
than the whole world; and though I will die for you blithely, it would
be like all the joys of Paradise to live on and spend my life in your
service.”

As he stopped speaking, a bell began to ring loudly in the interior of
the house; and a clatter of armour in the corridor showed that the
retainers were returning to their post, and the two hours were at an
end.

“After all that you have heard?” she whispered, leaning towards him
with her lips and eyes.

“I have heard nothing,” he replied.

“The captain’s name was Florimond de Champdivers,” she said in his ear.

“I did not hear it,” he answered, taking her supple body in his arms
and covering her wet face with kisses.

A melodious chirping was audible behind, followed by a beautiful
chuckle, and the voice of Messire de Malétroit wished his new nephew a
good morning.




PROVIDENCE AND THE GUITAR




CHAPTER I


Monsieur Léon Berthelini had a great care of his appearance, and
sedulously suited his deportment to the costume of the hour. He
affected something Spanish in his air, and something of the bandit,
with a flavour of Rembrandt at home. In person he was decidedly small
and inclined to be stout; his face was the picture of good humour; his
dark eyes, which were very expressive, told of a kind heart, a brisk,
merry nature, and the most indefatigable spirits. If he had worn the
clothes of the period you would have set him down for a hitherto
undiscovered hybrid between the barber, the innkeeper, and the affable
dispensing chemist. But in the outrageous bravery of velvet jacket and
flapped hat, with trousers that were more accurately described as
fleshings, a white handkerchief cavalierly knotted at his neck, a shock
of Olympian curls upon his brow, and his feet shod through all weathers
in the slenderest of Molière shoes—you had but to look at him and you
knew you were in the presence of a Great Creature. When he wore an
overcoat he scorned to pass the sleeves; a single button held it round
his shoulders; it was tossed backwards after the manner of a cloak, and
carried with the gait and presence of an Almaviva. I am of opinion that
M. Berthelini was nearing forty. But he had a boy’s heart, gloried in
his finery, and walked through life like a child in a perpetual
dramatic performance. If he were not Almaviva after all, it was not for
lack of making believe. And he enjoyed the artist’s compensation. If he
were not really Almaviva, he was sometimes just as happy as though he
were.

I have seen him, at moments when he has fancied himself alone with his
Maker, adopt so gay and chivalrous a bearing, and represent his own
part with so much warmth and conscience, that the illusion became
catching, and I believed implicitly in the Great Creature’s pose.

But, alas! life cannot be entirely conducted on these principles; man
cannot live by Almavivery alone; and the Great Creature, having failed
upon several theatres, was obliged to step down every evening from his
heights, and sing from half-a-dozen to a dozen comic songs, twang a
guitar, keep a country audience in good humour, and preside finally
over the mysteries of a tombola.

Madame Berthelini, who was art and part with him in these undignified
labours, had perhaps a higher position in the scale of beings, and
enjoyed a natural dignity of her own. But her heart was not any more
rightly placed, for that would have been impossible; and she had
acquired a little air of melancholy, attractive enough in its way, but
not good to see like the wholesome, sky-scraping, boyish spirits of her
lord.

He, indeed, swam like a kite on a fair wind, high above earthly
troubles. Detonations of temper were not unfrequent in the zones he
travelled; but sulky fogs and tearful depressions were there alike
unknown. A well-delivered blow upon a table, or a noble attitude,
imitated from Mélingne or Frederic, relieved his irritation like a
vengeance. Though the heaven had fallen, if he had played his part with
propriety, Berthelini had been content! And the man’s atmosphere, if
not his example, reacted on his wife; for the couple doated on each
other, and although you would have thought they walked in different
worlds, yet continued to walk hand in hand.

It chanced one day that Monsieur and Madame Berthelini descended with
two boxes and a guitar in a fat case at the station of the little town
of Castel-le-Gâchis, and the omnibus carried them with their effects to
the Hotel of the Black Head. This was a dismal, conventual building in
a narrow street, capable of standing siege when once the gates were
shut, and smelling strangely in the interior of straw and chocolate and
old feminine apparel. Berthelini paused upon the threshold with a
painful premonition. In some former state, it seemed to him, he had
visited a hostelry that smelt not otherwise, and been ill received.

The landlord, a tragic person in a large felt hat, rose from a business
table under the key-rack, and came forward, removing his hat with both
hands as he did so.

“Sir, I salute you. May I inquire what is your charge for artists?”
inquired Berthelini, with a courtesy at once splendid and insinuating.

“For artists?” said the landlord. His countenance fell and the smile of
welcome disappeared. “Oh, artists!” he added brutally; “four francs a
day.” And he turned his back upon these inconsiderable customers.

A commercial traveller is received, he also, upon a reduction—yet is he
welcome, yet can he command the fatted calf; but an artist, had he the
manners of an Almaviva, were he dressed like Solomon in all his glory,
is received like a dog and served like a timid lady travelling alone.

Accustomed as he was to the rubs of his profession, Berthelini was
unpleasantly affected by the landlord’s manner.

“Elvira,” said he to his wife, “mark my words: Castel-le-Gâchis is a
tragic folly.”

“Wait till we see what we take,” replied Elvira.

“We shall take nothing,” returned Berthelini; “we shall feed upon
insults. I have an eye, Elvira: I have a spirit of divination; and this
place is accursed. The landlord has been discourteous, the Commissary
will be brutal, the audience will be sordid and uproarious, and you
will take a cold upon your throat. We have been besotted enough to
come; the die is cast—it will be a second Sédan.”

Sédan was a town hateful to the Berthelinis, not only from patriotism
(for they were French, and answered after the flesh to the somewhat
homely name of Duval), but because it had been the scene of their most
sad reverses. In that place they had lain three weeks in pawn for their
hotel bill, and had it not been for a surprising stroke of fortune they
might have been lying there in pawn until this day. To mention the name
of Sédan was for the Berthelinis to dip the brush in earthquake and
eclipse. Count Almaviva slouched his hat with a gesture expressive of
despair, and even Elvira felt as if ill-fortune had been personally
invoked.

“Let us ask for breakfast,” said she, with a woman’s tact.

The Commissary of Police of Castel-le-Gâchis was a large red
Commissary, pimpled, and subject to a strong cutaneous transpiration. I
have repeated the name of his office because he was so very much more a
Commissary than a man. The spirit of his dignity had entered into him.
He carried his corporation as if it were something official. Whenever
he insulted a common citizen it seemed to him as if he were adroitly
flattering the Government by a side wind; in default of dignity he was
brutal from an overweening sense of duty. His office was a den, whence
passers-by could hear rude accents laying down, not the law, but the
good pleasure of the Commissary.

Six several times in the course of the day did M. Berthelini hurry
thither in quest of the requisite permission for his evening’s
entertainment; six several times he found the official was abroad. Léon
Berthelini began to grow quite a familiar figure in the streets of
Castel-le-Gâchis; he became a local celebrity, and was pointed out as
“the man who was looking for the Commissary.” Idle children attached
themselves to his footsteps, and trotted after him back and forward
between the hotel and the office. Léon might try as he liked; he might
roll cigarettes, he might straddle, he might cock his hat at a dozen
different jaunty inclinations—the part of Almaviva was, under the
circumstances, difficult to play.

As he passed the market-place upon the seventh excursion the Commissary
was pointed out to him, where he stood, with his waistcoat unbuttoned
and his hands behind his back, to superintend the sale and measurement
of butter. Berthelini threaded his way through the market stalls and
baskets, and accosted the dignitary with a bow which was a triumph of
the histrionic art.

“I have the honour,” he asked, “of meeting M. le Commissaire?”

The Commissary was affected by the nobility of his address. He excelled
Léon in the depth if not in the airy grace of his salutation.

“The honour,” said he, “is mine!”

“I am,” continued the strolling-player, “I am, sir, an artist, and I
have permitted myself to interrupt you on an affair of business.
To-night I give a trifling musical entertainment at the Café of the
Triumphs of the Plough—permit me to offer you this little programme—and
I have come to ask you for the necessary authorisation.”

At the word “artist,” the Commissary had replaced his hat with the air
of a person who, having condescended too far, should suddenly remember
the duties of his rank.

“Go, go,” said he, “I am busy—I am measuring butter.”

“Heathen Jew!” thought Léon. “Permit me, sir,” he resumed aloud. “I
have gone six times already—”

“Put up your bills if you choose,” interrupted the Commissary. “In an
hour or so I will examine your papers at the office. But now go; I am
busy.”

“Measuring butter!” thought Berthelini. “Oh, France, and it is for this
that we made ’93!”

The preparations were soon made; the bills posted, programmes laid on
the dinner-table of every hotel in the town, and a stage erected at one
end of the Café of the Triumphs of the Plough; but when Léon returned
to the office, the Commissary was once more abroad.

“He is like Madame Benoîton,” thought Léon, “Fichu Commissaire!”

And just then he met the man face to face.

“Here, sir,” said he, “are my papers. Will you be pleased to verify?”

But the Commissary was now intent upon dinner.

“No use,” he replied, “no use; I am busy; I am quite satisfied. Give
your entertainment.”

And he hurried on.

“Fichu Commissaire!” thought Léon.




CHAPTER II


The audience was pretty large; and the proprietor of the café made a
good thing of it in beer. But the Berthelinis exerted themselves in
vain.

Léon was radiant in velveteen; he had a rakish way of smoking a
cigarette between his songs that was worth money in itself; he
underlined his comic points, so that the dullest numskull in
Castel-le-Gâchis had a notion when to laugh; and he handled his guitar
in a manner worthy of himself. Indeed his play with that instrument was
as good as a whole romantic drama; it was so dashing, so florid, and so
cavalier.

Elvira, on the other hand, sang her patriotic and romantic songs with
more than usual expression; her voice had charm and plangency; and as
Léon looked at her, in her low-bodied maroon dress, with her arms bare
to the shoulder, and a red flower set provocatively in her corset, he
repeated to himself for the many hundredth time that she was one of the
loveliest creatures in the world of women.

Alas! when she went round with the tambourine, the golden youth of
Castel-le-Gâchis turned from her coldly. Here and there a single
halfpenny was forthcoming; the net result of a collection never
exceeded half a franc; and the Maire himself, after seven different
applications, had contributed exactly twopence. A certain chill began
to settle upon the artists themselves; it seemed as if they were
singing to slugs; Apollo himself might have lost heart with such an
audience. The Berthelinis struggled against the impression; they put
their back into their work, they sang loud and louder, the guitar
twanged like a living thing; and at last Léon arose in his might, and
burst with inimitable conviction into his great song, “Y a des honnêtes
gens partout!” Never had he given more proof of his artistic mastery;
it was his intimate, indefeasible conviction that Castel-le-Gâchis
formed an exception to the law he was now lyrically proclaiming, and
was peopled exclusively by thieves and bullies; and yet, as I say, he
flung it down like a challenge, he trolled it forth like an article of
faith; and his face so beamed the while that you would have thought he
must make converts of the benches.

He was at the top of his register, with his head thrown back and his
mouth open, when the door was thrown violently open, and a pair of new
comers marched noisily into the café. It was the Commissary, followed
by the Garde Champêtre.

The undaunted Berthelini still continued to proclaim, “Y a des honnêtes
gens partout!” But now the sentiment produced an audible titter among
the audience. Berthelini wondered why; he did not know the antecedents
of the Garde Champêtre; he had never heard of a little story about
postage stamps. But the public knew all about the postage stamps and
enjoyed the coincidence hugely.

The Commissary planted himself upon a vacant chair with somewhat the
air of Cromwell visiting the Rump, and spoke in occasional whispers to
the Garde Champêtre, who remained respectfully standing at his back.
The eyes of both were directed upon Berthelini, who persisted in his
statement.

“Y a des honnêtes gens partout,” he was just chanting for the twentieth
time; when up got the Commissary upon his feet and waved brutally to
the singer with his cane.

“Is it me you want?” inquired Léon, stopping in his song.

“It is you,” replied the potentate.

“Fichu Commissaire!” thought Léon, and he descended from the stage and
made his way to the functionary.

“How does it happen, sir,” said the Commissary, swelling in person,
“that I find you mountebanking in a public café without my permission?”

“Without?” cried the indignant Léon. “Permit me to remind you—”

“Come, come, sir!” said the Commissary, “I desire no explanations.”

“I care nothing about what you desire,” returned the singer. “I choose
to give them, and I will not be gagged. I am an artist, sir, a
distinction that you cannot comprehend. I received your permission and
stand here upon the strength of it; interfere with me who dare.”

“You have not got my signature, I tell you,” cried the Commissary.
“Show me my signature! Where is my signature?”

That was just the question; where was his signature? Léon recognised
that he was in a hole; but his spirit rose with the occasion, and he
blustered nobly, tossing back his curls. The Commissary played up to
him in the character of tyrant; and as the one leaned farther forward,
the other leaned farther back—majesty confronting fury. The audience
had transferred their attention to this new performance, and listened
with that silent gravity common to all Frenchmen in the neighbourhood
of the Police. Elvira had sat down, she was used to these distractions,
and it was rather melancholy than fear that now oppressed her.

“Another word,” cried the Commissary, “and I arrest you.”

“Arrest me?” shouted Léon. “I defy you!”

“I am the Commissary of Police,” said the official.

Léon commanded his feelings, and replied, with great delicacy of
innuendo—

“So it would appear.”

The point was too refined for Castel-le-Gâchis; it did not raise a
smile; and as for the Commissary, he simply bade the singer follow him
to his office, and directed his proud footsteps towards the door. There
was nothing for it but to obey. Léon did so with a proper pantomime of
indifference, but it was a leek to eat, and there was no denying it.

The Maire had slipped out and was already waiting at the Commissary’s
door. Now the Maire, in France, is the refuge of the oppressed. He
stands between his people and the boisterous rigours of the Police. He
can sometimes understand what is said to him; he is not always puffed
up beyond measure by his dignity. ’Tis a thing worth the knowledge of
travellers. When all seems over, and a man has made up his mind to
injustice, he has still, like the heroes of romance, a little bugle at
his belt whereon to blow; and the Maire, a comfortable _deus ex
machinâ_, may still descend to deliver him from the minions of the law.
The Maire of Castel-le-Gâchis, although inaccessible to the charms of
music as retailed by the Berthelinis, had no hesitation whatever as to
the rights of the matter. He instantly fell foul of the Commissary in
very high terms, and the Commissary, pricked by this humiliation,
accepted battle on the point of fact. The argument lasted some little
while with varying success, until at length victory inclined so plainly
to the Commissary’s side that the Maire was fain to reassert himself by
an exercise of authority. He had been out-argued, but he was still the
Maire. And so, turning from his interlocutor, he briefly but kindly
recommended Léon to get back instanter to his concert.

“It is already growing late,” he added.

Léon did not wait to be told twice. He returned to the Café of the
Triumphs of the Plough with all expedition. Alas! the audience had
melted away during his absence; Elvira was sitting in a very
disconsolate attitude on the guitar-box; she had watched the company
dispersing by twos and threes, and the prolonged spectacle had somewhat
overwhelmed her spirits. Each man, she reflected, retired with a
certain proportion of her earnings in his pocket, and she saw
to-night’s board and to-morrow’s railway expenses, and finally even
to-morrow’s dinner, walk one after another out of the café door and
disappear into the night.

“What was it?” she asked languidly. But Léon did not answer. He was
looking round him on the scene of defeat. Scarce a score of listeners
remained, and these of the least promising sort. The minute hand of the
clock was already climbing upward towards eleven.

“It’s a lost battle,” said he, and then taking up the money-box he
turned it out. “Three francs seventy-five!” he cried, “as against four
of board and six of railway fares; and no time for the tombola! Elvira,
this is Waterloo.” And he sat down and passed both hands desperately
among his curls. “O Fichu Commissaire!” he cried, “Fichu Commissaire!”

“Let us get the things together and be off,” returned Elvira. “We might
try another song, but there is not six halfpence in the room.”

“Six halfpence?” cried Léon, “six hundred thousand devils! There is not
a human creature in the town—nothing but pigs and dogs and
commissaires! Pray heaven, we get safe to bed.”

“Don’t imagine things!” exclaimed Elvira, with a shudder.

And with that they set to work on their preparations. The tobacco-jar,
the cigarette-holder, the three papers of shirt-studs, which were to
have been the prices of the tombola had the tombola come off, were made
into a bundle with the music; the guitar was stowed into the fat
guitar-case; and Elvira having thrown a thin shawl about her neck and
shoulders, the pair issued from the café and set off for the Black
Head.

As they crossed the market-place the church bell rang out eleven. It
was a dark, mild night, and there was no one in the streets.

“It is all very fine,” said Léon; “but I have a presentiment. The night
is not yet done.”




CHAPTER III


The “Black Head” presented not a single chink of light upon the street,
and the carriage gate was closed.

“This is unprecedented,” observed Léon. “An inn closed by five minutes
after eleven! And there were several commercial travellers in the café
up to a late hour. Elvira, my heart misgives me. Let us ring the bell.”

The bell had a potent note; and being swung under the arch it filled
the house from top to bottom with surly, clanging reverberations. The
sound accentuated the conventual appearance of the building; a wintry
sentiment, a thought of prayer and mortification, took hold upon
Elvira’s mind; and, as for Léon, he seemed to be reading the stage
directions for a lugubrious fifth act.

“This is your fault,” said Elvira: “this is what comes of fancying
things!”

Again Léon pulled the bell-rope; again the solemn tocsin awoke the
echoes of the inn; and ere they had died away, a light glimmered in the
carriage entrance, and a powerful voice was heard upraised and
tremulous with wrath.

“What’s all this?” cried the tragic host through the spars of the gate.
“Hard upon twelve, and you come clamouring like Prussians at the door
of a respectable hotel? Oh!” he cried, “I know you now! Common singers!
People in trouble with the police! And you present yourselves at
midnight like lords and ladies? Be off with you!”

“You will permit me to remind you,” replied Léon, in thrilling tones,
“that I am a guest in your house, that I am properly inscribed, and
that I have deposited baggage to the value of four hundred francs.”

“You cannot get in at this hour,” returned the man. “This is no
thieves’ tavern, for mohocks and night rakes and organ-grinders.”

“Brute!” cried Elvira, for the organ-grinders touched her home.

“Then I demand my baggage,” said Léon, with unabated dignity.

“I know nothing of your baggage,” replied the landlord.

“You detain my baggage? You dare to detain my baggage?” cried the
singer.

“Who are you?” returned the landlord. “It is dark—I cannot recognise
you.”

“Very well, then—you detain my baggage,” concluded Léon. “You shall
smart for this. I will weary out your life with persecutions; I will
drag you from court to court; if there is justice to be had in France,
it shall be rendered between you and me. And I will make you a
by-word—I will put you in a song—a scurrilous song—an indecent song—a
popular song—which the boys shall sing to you in the street, and come
and howl through these spars at midnight!”

He had gone on raising his voice at every phrase, for all the while the
landlord was very placidly retiring; and now, when the last glimmer of
light had vanished from the arch, and the last footstep died away in
the interior, Léon turned to his wife with a heroic countenance.

“Elvira,” said he, “I have now a duty in life. I shall destroy that man
as Eugène Sue destroyed the concierge. Let us come at once to the
Gendarmerie and begin our vengeance.”

He picked up the guitar-case, which had been propped against the wall,
and they set forth through the silent and ill-lighted town with burning
hearts.

The Gendarmerie was concealed beside the telegraph office at the bottom
of a vast court, which was partly laid out in gardens; and here all the
shepherds of the public lay locked in grateful sleep. It took a deal of
knocking to waken one; and he, when he came at last to the door, could
find no other remark but that “it was none of his business.” Léon
reasoned with him, threatened him, besought him; “here,” he said, “was
Madame Berthelini in evening dress—a delicate woman—in an interesting
condition”—the last was thrown in, I fancy, for effect; and to all this
the man-at-arms made the same answer:

“It is none of my business,” said he.

“Very well,” said Léon, “then we shall go to the Commissary.” Thither
they went; the office was closed and dark; but the house was close by,
and Léon was soon swinging the bell like a madman. The Commissary’s
wife appeared at a window. She was a thread-paper creature, and
informed them that the Commissary had not yet come home.

“Is he at the Maire’s?” demanded Léon.

She thought that was not unlikely.

“Where is the Maire’s house?” he asked.

And she gave him some rather vague information on that point.

“Stay you here, Elvira,” said Léon, “lest I should miss him by the way.
If, when I return, I find you here no longer, I shall follow at once to
the Black Head.”

And he set out to find the Maire’s. It took him some ten minutes
wandering among blind lanes, and when he arrived it was already
half-an-hour past midnight. A long white garden wall overhung by some
thick chestnuts, a door with a letter-box, and an iron bell-pull, that
was all that could be seen of the Maire’s domicile. Léon took the
bell-pull in both hands, and danced furiously upon the side-walk. The
bell itself was just upon the other side of the wall, it responded to
his activity, and scattered an alarming clangour far and wide into the
night.

A window was thrown open in a house across the street, and a voice
inquired the cause of this untimely uproar.

“I wish the Maire,” said Léon.

“He has been in bed this hour,” returned the voice.

“He must get up again,” retorted Léon, and he was for tackling the
bell-pull once more.

“You will never make him hear,” responded the voice. “The garden is of
great extent, the house is at the farther end, and both the Maire and
his housekeeper are deaf.”

“Aha!” said Léon, pausing. “The Maire is deaf, is he? That explains.”
And he thought of the evening’s concert with a momentary feeling of
relief. “Ah!” he continued, “and so the Maire is deaf, and the garden
vast, and the house at the far end?”

“And you might ring all night,” added the voice, “and be none the
better for it. You would only keep me awake.”

“Thank you, neighbour,” replied the singer. “You shall sleep.”

And he made off again at his best pace for the Commissary’s. Elvira was
still walking to and fro before the door.

“He has not come?” asked Léon.

“Not he,” she replied.

“Good,” returned Léon. “I am sure our man’s inside. Let me see the
guitar-case. I shall lay this siege in form, Elvira; I am angry; I am
indignant; I am truculently inclined; but I thank my Maker I have still
a sense of fun. The unjust judge shall be importuned in a serenade,
Elvira. Set him up—and set him up.”

He had the case opened by this time, struck a few chords, and fell into
an attitude which was irresistibly Spanish.

“Now,” he continued, “feel your voice. Are you ready? Follow me!”

The guitar twanged, and the two voices upraised, in harmony and with a
startling loudness, the chorus of a song of old Béranger’s:—

“Commissaire! Commissaire!
Colin bat sa ménagère.”


The stones of Castel-le-Gâchis thrilled at this audacious innovation.
Hitherto had the night been sacred to repose and nightcaps; and now
what was this? Window after window was opened; matches scratched, and
candles began to flicker; swollen sleepy faces peered forth into the
starlight. There were the two figures before the Commissary’s house,
each bolt upright, with head thrown back and eyes interrogating the
starry heavens; the guitar wailed, shouted, and reverberated like half
an orchestra; and the voices, with a crisp and spirited delivery,
hurled the appropriate burden at the Commissary’s window. All the
echoes repeated the functionary’s name. It was more like an entr’acte
in a farce of Molière’s than a passage of real life in
Castel-le-Gâchis.

The Commissary, if he was not the first, was not the last of the
neighbours to yield to the influence of music, and furiously throw open
the window of his bedroom. He was beside himself with rage. He leaned
far over the window-sill, raving and gesticulating; the tassel of his
white night-cap danced like a thing of life: he opened his mouth to
dimensions hitherto unprecedented, and yet his voice, instead of
escaping from it in a roar, came forth shrill and choked and tottering.
A little more serenading, and it was clear he would be better
acquainted with the apoplexy.

I scorn to reproduce his language; he touched upon too many serious
topics by the way for a quiet story-teller. Although he was known for a
man who was prompt with his tongue, and had a power of strong
expression at command, he excelled himself so remarkably this night
that one maiden lady, who had got out of bed like the rest to hear the
serenade, was obliged to shut her window at the second clause. Even
what she had heard disquieted her conscience; and next day she said she
scarcely reckoned as a maiden lady any longer.

Léon tried to explain his predicament, but he received nothing but
threats of arrest by way of answer.

“If I come down to you!” cried the Commissary.

“Aye,” said Léon, “do!”

“I will not!” cried the Commissary.

“You dare not!” answered Léon.

At that the Commissary closed his window.

“All is over,” said the singer. “The serenade was perhaps ill-judged.
These boors have no sense of humour.”

“Let us get away from here,” said Elvira, with a shiver. “All these
people looking—it is so rude and so brutal.” And then giving way once
more to passion—“Brutes!” she cried aloud to the candle-lit
spectators—“brutes! brutes! brutes!”

“Sauve qui peut,” said Léon. “You have done it now!”

And taking the guitar in one hand and the case in the other, he led the
way with something too precipitate to be merely called precipitation
from the scene of this absurd adventure.




CHAPTER IV


To the west of Castel-le-Gâchis four rows of venerable lime-trees
formed, in this starry night, a twilit avenue with two side aisles of
pitch darkness. Here and there stone benches were disposed between the
trunks. There was not a breath of wind; a heavy atmosphere of perfume
hung about the alleys; and every leaf stood stock-still upon its twig.
Hither, after vainly knocking at an inn or two, the Berthelinis came at
length to pass the night. After an amiable contention, Léon insisted on
giving his coat to Elvira, and they sat down together on the first
bench in silence. Léon made a cigarette, which he smoked to an end,
looking up into the trees, and, beyond them, at the constellations, of
which he tried vainly to recall the names. The silence was broken by
the church bell; it rang the four quarters on a light and tinkling
measure; then followed a single deep stroke that died slowly away with
a thrill; and stillness resumed its empire.

“One,” said Léon. “Four hours till daylight. It is warm; it is starry;
I have matches and tobacco. Do not let us exaggerate, Elvira—the
experience is positively charming. I feel a glow within me; I am born
again. This is the poetry of life. Think of Cooper’s novels, my dear.”

“Léon,” she said fiercely, “how can you talk such wicked, infamous
nonsense? To pass all night out-of-doors—it is like a nightmare! We
shall die.”

“You suffer yourself to be led away,” he replied soothingly. “It is not
unpleasant here; only you brood. Come, now, let us repeat a scene.
Shall we try Alceste and Célimène? No? Or a passage from the ‘Two
Orphans’? Come, now, it will occupy your mind; I will play up to you as
I never have played before; I feel art moving in my bones.”

“Hold your tongue,” she cried, “or you will drive me mad! Will nothing
solemnise you—not even this hideous situation?”

“Oh, hideous!” objected Léon. “Hideous is not the word. Why, where
would you be? ‘Dites, la jeune belle, où voulez-vous aller?’” he
carolled. “Well, now,” he went on, opening the guitar-case, “there’s
another idea for you—sing. Sing ‘Dites, la jeune belle!’ It will
compose your spirits, Elvira, I am sure.”

And without waiting an answer he began to strum the symphony. The first
chords awoke a young man who was lying asleep upon a neighbouring
bench.

“Hullo!” cried the young man, “who are you?”

“Under which king, Bezonian?” declaimed the artist. “Speak or die!”

Or if it was not exactly that, it was something to much the same
purpose from a French tragedy.

The young man drew near in the twilight. He was a tall, powerful,
gentlemanly fellow, with a somewhat puffy face, dressed in a grey tweed
suit, with a deer-stalker hat of the same material; and as he now came
forward he carried a knapsack slung upon one arm.

“Are you camping out here too?” he asked, with a strong English accent.
“I’m not sorry for company.”

Léon explained their misadventure; and the other told them that he was
a Cambridge undergraduate on a walking tour, that he had run short of
money, could no longer pay for his night’s lodging, had already been
camping out for two nights, and feared he should require to continue
the same manœuvre for at least two nights more.

“Luckily, it’s jolly weather,” he concluded.

“You hear that, Elvira,” said Léon. “Madame Berthelini,” he went on,
“is ridiculously affected by this trifling occurrence. For my part, I
find it romantic and far from uncomfortable; or at least,” he added,
shifting on the stone bench, “not quite so uncomfortable as might have
been expected. But pray be seated.”

“Yes,” returned the undergraduate, sitting down, “it’s rather nice than
otherwise when once you’re used to it; only it’s devilish difficult to
get washed. I like the fresh air and these stars and things.”

“Aha!” said Léon, “Monsieur is an artist.”

“An artist?” returned the other, with a blank stare. “Not if I know
it!”

“Pardon me,” said the actor. “What you said this moment about the orbs
of heaven—”

“Oh, nonsense!” cried the Englishman. “A fellow may admire the stars
and be anything he likes.”

“You have an artist’s nature, however, Mr.—I beg your pardon; may I,
without indiscretion, inquire your name?” asked Léon.

“My name is Stubbs,” replied the Englishman.

“I thank you,” returned Léon. “Mine is Berthelini—Léon Berthelini,
ex-artist of the theatres of Montrouge, Belleville, and Montmartre.
Humble as you see me, I have created with applause more than one
important _rôle_. The Press were unanimous in praise of my Howling
Devil of the Mountains, in the piece of the same name. Madame, whom I
now present to you, is herself an artist, and I must not omit to state,
a better artist than her husband. She also is a creator; she created
nearly twenty successful songs at one of the principal Parisian
music-halls. But, to continue, I was saying you had an artist’s nature,
Monsieur Stubbs, and you must permit me to be a judge in such a
question. I trust you will not falsify your instincts; let me beseech
you to follow the career of an artist.”

“Thank you,” returned Stubbs, with a chuckle. “I’m going to be a
banker.”

“No,” said Léon, “do not say so. Not that. A man with such a nature as
yours should not derogate so far. What are a few privations here and
there, so long as you are working for a high and noble goal?”

“This fellow’s mad,” thought Stubbs; “but the woman’s rather pretty,
and he’s not bad fun himself, if you come to that.” What he said was
different. “I thought you said you were an actor?”

“I certainly did so,” replied Léon. “I am one, or, alas! I was.”

“And so you want me to be an actor, do you?” continued the
undergraduate. “Why, man, I could never so much as learn the stuff; my
memory’s like a sieve; and as for acting, I’ve no more idea than a
cat.”

“The stage is not the only course,” said Léon. “Be a sculptor, be a
dancer, be a poet or a novelist; follow your heart, in short, and do
some thorough work before you die.”

“And do you call all these things _art_?” inquired Stubbs.

“Why, certainly!” returned Léon. “Are they not all branches?”

“Oh! I didn’t know,” replied the Englishman. “I thought an artist meant
a fellow who painted.”

The singer stared at him in some surprise.

“It is the difference of language,” he said at last. “This Tower of
Babel, when shall we have paid for it? If I could speak English you
would follow me more readily.”

“Between you and me, I don’t believe I should,” replied the other. “You
seem to have thought a devil of a lot about this business. For my part,
I admire the stars, and like to have them shining—it’s so cheery—but
hang me if I had an idea it had anything to do with art! It’s not in my
line, you see. I’m not intellectual; I have no end of trouble to scrape
through my exams., I can tell you! But I’m not a bad sort at bottom,”
he added, seeing his interlocutor looked distressed even in the dim
starshine, “and I rather like the play, and music, and guitars, and
things.”

Léon had a perception that the understanding was incomplete. He changed
the subject.

“And so you travel on foot?” he continued. “How romantic! How
courageous! And how are you pleased with my land? How does the scenery
affect you among these wild hills of ours?”

“Well, the fact is,” began Stubbs—he was about to say that he didn’t
care for scenery, which was not at all true, being, on the contrary,
only an athletic undergraduate pretension; but he had begun to suspect
that Berthelini liked a different sort of meat, and substituted
something else—“The fact is, I think it jolly. They told me it was no
good up here; even the guide-book said so; but I don’t know what they
meant. I think it is deuced pretty—upon my word, I do.”

At this moment, in the most unexpected manner, Elvira burst into tears.

“My voice!” she cried. “Léon, if I stay here longer I shall lose my
voice!”

“You shall not stay another moment,” cried the actor. “If I have to
beat in a door, if I have to burn the town, I shall find you shelter.”

With that he replaced the guitar, and comforting her with some
caresses, drew her arm through his.

“Monsieur Stubbs,” said he, taking of his hat, “the reception I offer
you is rather problematical; but let me beseech you to give us the
pleasure of your society. You are a little embarrassed for the moment;
you must, indeed, permit me to advance what may be necessary. I ask it
as a favour; we must not part so soon after having met so strangely.”

“Oh, come, you know,” said Stubbs, “I can’t let a fellow like you—” And
there he paused, feeling somehow or other on a wrong tack.

“I do not wish to employ menaces,” continued Léon, with a smile; “but
if you refuse, indeed I shall not take it kindly.”

“I don’t quite see my way out of it,” thought the undergraduate; and
then, after a pause, he said, aloud and ungraciously enough, “All
right. I—I’m very much obliged, of course.” And he proceeded to follow
them, thinking in his heart, “But it’s bad form, all the same, to force
an obligation on a fellow.”




CHAPTER V


Léon strode ahead as if he knew exactly where he was going; the sobs of
Madame were still faintly audible, and no one uttered a word. A dog
barked furiously in a courtyard as they went by; then the church clock
struck two, and many domestic clocks followed or preceded it in piping
tones. And just then Berthelini spied a light. It burned in a small
house on the outskirts of the town, and thither the party now directed
their steps.

“It is always a chance,” said Léon.

The house in question stood back from the street behind an open space,
part garden, part turnip-field; and several outhouses stood forward
from either wing at right angles to the front. One of these had
recently undergone some change. An enormous window, looking towards the
north, had been effected in the wall and roof, and Léon began to hope
it was a studio.

“If it’s only a painter,” he said with a chuckle, “ten to one we get as
good a welcome as we want.”

“I thought painters were principally poor,” said Stubbs.

“Ah!” cried Léon, “you do not know the world as I do. The poorer the
better for us!”

And the trio advanced into the turnip-field.

The light was in the ground floor; as one window was brightly
illuminated and two others more faintly, it might be supposed that
there was a single lamp in one corner of a large apartment; and a
certain tremulousness and temporary dwindling showed that a live fire
contributed to the effect. The sound of a voice now became audible; and
the trespassers paused to listen. It was pitched in a high, angry key,
but had still a good, full, and masculine note in it. The utterance was
voluble, too voluble even to be quite distinct; a stream of words,
rising and falling, with ever and again a phrase thrown out by itself,
as if the speaker reckoned on its virtue.

Suddenly another voice joined in. This time it was a woman’s; and if
the man were angry, the woman was incensed to the degree of fury. There
was that absolutely blank composure known to suffering males; that
colourless unnatural speech which shows a spirit accurately balanced
between homicide and hysterics; the tone in which the best of women
sometimes utter words worse than death to those most dear to them. If
Abstract Bones-and-Sepulchre were to be endowed with the gift of
speech, thus, and not otherwise, would it discourse. Léon was a brave
man, and I fear he was somewhat sceptically given (he had been educated
in a Papistical country), but the habit of childhood prevailed, and he
crossed himself devoutly. He had met several women in his career. It
was obvious that his instinct had not deceived him, for the male voice
broke forth instantly in a towering passion.

The undergraduate, who had not understood the significance of the
woman’s contribution, pricked up his ears at the change upon the man.

“There’s going to be a free fight,” he opined.

There was another retort from the woman, still calm but a little
higher.

“Hysterics?” asked Léon of his wife. “Is that the stage direction?”

“How should I know?” returned Elvira, somewhat tartly.

“Oh, woman, woman!” said Léon, beginning to open the guitar-case. “It
is one of the burdens of my life, Monsieur Stubbs; they support each
other; they always pretend there is no system; they say it’s nature.
Even Madame Berthelini, who is a dramatic artist!”

“You are heartless, Léon,” said Elvira; “that woman is in trouble.”

“And the man, my angel?” inquired Berthelini, passing the ribbon of his
guitar. “And the man, _m’amour_?”

“He is a man,” she answered.

“You hear that?” said Léon to Stubbs. “It is not too late for you. Mark
the intonation. And now,” he continued, “what are we to give them?”

“Are you going to sing?” asked Stubbs.

“I am a troubadour,” replied Léon. “I claim a welcome by and for my
art. If I were a banker could I do as much?”

“Well, you wouldn’t need, you know,” answered the undergraduate.

“Egad,” said Léon, “but that’s true. Elvira, that is true.”

“Of course it is,” she replied. “Did you not know it?”

“My dear,” answered Léon impressively, “I know nothing but what is
agreeable. Even my knowledge of life is a work of art superiorly
composed. But what are we to give them? It should be something
appropriate.”

Visions of “Let dogs delight” passed through the undergraduate’s mind;
but it occurred to him that the poetry was English and that he did not
know the air. Hence he contributed no suggestion.

“Something about our houselessness,” said Elvira.

“I have it,” cried Léon. And he broke forth into a song of Pierre
Dupont’s:—

“Savez-vous où gite,
Mai, ce joli mois?”


Elvira joined in; so did Stubbs, with a good ear and voice, but an
imperfect acquaintance with the music. Léon and the guitar were equal
to the situation. The actor dispensed his throat-notes with prodigality
and enthusiasm; and, as he looked up to heaven in his heroic way,
tossing the black ringlets, it seemed to him that the very stars
contributed a dumb applause to his efforts, and the universe lent him
its silence for a chorus. That is one of the best features of the
heavenly bodies, that they belong to everybody in particular; and a man
like Léon, a chronic Endymion who managed to get along without
encouragement, is always the world’s centre for himself.

He alone—and it is to be noted, he was the worst singer of the
three—took the music seriously to heart, and judged the serenade from a
high artistic point of view. Elvira, on the other hand, was preoccupied
about their reception; and, as for Stubbs, he considered the whole
affair in the light of a broad joke.

“Know you the lair of May, the lovely month?” went the three voices in
the turnip-field.

The inhabitants were plainly fluttered; the light moved to and fro,
strengthening in one window, paling in another; and then the door was
thrown open, and a man in a blouse appeared on the threshold carrying a
lamp. He was a powerful young fellow, with bewildered hair and beard,
wearing his neck open; his blouse was stained with oil-colours in a
harlequinesque disorder; and there was something rural in the droop and
bagginess of his belted trousers.

From immediately behind him, and indeed over his shoulder, a woman’s
face looked out into the darkness; it was pale and a little weary,
although still young; it wore a dwindling, disappearing prettiness,
soon to be quite gone, and the expression was both gentle and sour, and
reminded one faintly of the taste of certain drugs. For all that, it
was not a face to dislike; when the prettiness had vanished, it seemed
as if a certain pale beauty might step in to take its place; and as
both the mildness and the asperity were characters of youth, it might
be hoped that, with years, both would merge into a constant, brave, and
not unkindly temper.

“What is all this?” cried the man.




CHAPTER VI


Léon had his hat in his hand at once. He came forward with his
customary grace; it was a moment which would have earned him a round of
cheering on the stage. Elvira and Stubbs advanced behind him, like a
couple of Admetus’s sheep following the god Apollo.

“Sir,” said Léon, “the hour is unpardonably late, and our little
serenade has the air of an impertinence. Believe me, sir, it is an
appeal. Monsieur is an artist, I perceive. We are here three artists
benighted and without shelter, one a woman—a delicate woman—in evening
dress—in an interesting situation. This will not fail to touch the
woman’s heart of Madame, whom I perceive indistinctly behind Monsieur
her husband, and whose face speaks eloquently of a well-regulated mind.
Ah! Monsieur, Madame—one generous movement, and you make three people
happy! Two or three hours beside your fire—I ask it of Monsieur in the
name of Art—I ask it of Madame by the sanctity of womanhood.”

The two, as by a tacit consent, drew back from the door.

“Come in,” said the man.

“Entrez, Madame,” said the woman.

The door opened directly upon the kitchen of the house, which was to
all appearance the only sitting-room. The furniture was both plain and
scanty; but there were one or two landscapes on the wall handsomely
framed, as if they had already visited the committee-rooms of an
exhibition and been thence extruded. Léon walked up to the pictures and
represented the part of a connoisseur before each in turn, with his
usual dramatic insight and force. The master of the house, as if
irresistibly attracted, followed him from canvas to canvas with the
lamp. Elvira was led directly to the fire, where she proceeded to warm
herself, while Stubbs stood in the middle of the floor and followed the
proceedings of Léon with mild astonishment in his eyes.

“You should see them by daylight,” said the artist.

“I promise myself that pleasure,” said Léon. “You possess, sir, if you
will permit me an observation, the art of composition to a T.”

“You are very good,” returned the other. “But should you not draw
nearer to the fire?”

“With all my heart,” said Léon.

And the whole party was soon gathered at the table over a hasty and not
an elegant cold supper, washed down with the least of small wines.
Nobody liked the meal, but nobody complained; they put a good face upon
it, one and all, and made a great clattering of knives and forks. To
see Léon eating a single cold sausage was to see a triumph; by the time
he had done he had got through as much pantomime as would have sufficed
for a baron of beef, and he had the relaxed expression of the
over-eaten.

As Elvira had naturally taken a place by the side of Léon, and Stubbs
as naturally, although I believe unconsciously, by the side of Elvira,
the host and hostess were left together. Yet it was to be noted that
they never addressed a word to each other, nor so much as suffered
their eyes to meet. The interrupted skirmish still survived in
ill-feeling; and the instant the guests departed it would break forth
again as bitterly as ever. The talk wandered from this to that
subject—for with one accord the party had declared it was too late to
go to bed; but those two never relaxed towards each other; Goneril and
Regan in a sisterly tiff were not more bent on enmity.

It chanced that Elvira was so much tired by all the little excitements
of the night, that for once she laid aside her company manners, which
were both easy and correct, and in the most natural manner in the world
leaned her head on Léon’s shoulder. At the same time, fatigue
suggesting tenderness, she locked the fingers of her right hand into
those of her husband’s left; and, half closing her eyes, dozed off into
a golden borderland between sleep and waking. But all the time she was
not aware of what was passing, and saw the painter’s wife studying her
with looks between contempt and envy.

It occurred to Léon that his constitution demanded the use of some
tobacco; and he undid his fingers from Elvira’s in order to roll a
cigarette. It was gently done, and he took care that his indulgence
should in no other way disturb his wife’s position. But it seemed to
catch the eye of the painter’s wife with a special significancy. She
looked straight before her for an instant, and then, with a swift and
stealthy movement, took hold of her husband’s hand below the table.
Alas! she might have spared herself the dexterity. For the poor fellow
was so overcome by this caress that he stopped with his mouth open in
the middle of a word, and by the expression of his face plainly
declared to all the company that his thoughts had been diverted into
softer channels.

If it had not been rather amiable, it would have been absurdly droll.
His wife at once withdrew her touch; but it was plain she had to exert
some force. Thereupon the young man coloured and looked for a moment
beautiful.

Léon and Elvira both observed the byplay, and a shock passed from one
to the other; for they were inveterate match-makers, especially between
those who were already married.

“I beg your pardon,” said Léon suddenly. “I see no use in pretending.
Before we came in here we heard sounds indicating—if I may so express
myself—an imperfect harmony.”

“Sir—” began the man.

But the woman was beforehand.

“It is quite true,” she said. “I see no cause to be ashamed. If my
husband is mad I shall at least do my utmost to prevent the
consequences. Picture to yourself, Monsieur and Madame,” she went on,
for she passed Stubbs over, “that this wretched person—a dauber, an
incompetent, not fit to be a sign-painter—receives this morning an
admirable offer from an uncle—an uncle of my own, my mother’s brother,
and tenderly beloved—of a clerkship with nearly a hundred and fifty
pounds a year, and that he—picture to yourself!—he refuses it! Why? For
the sake of Art, he says. Look at his art, I say—look at it! Is it fit
to be seen? Ask him—is it fit to be sold? And it is for this, Monsieur
and Madame, that he condemns me to the most deplorable existence,
without luxuries, without comforts, in a vile suburb of a country town.
O non!” she cried, “non—je ne me tairai pas—c’est plus fort que moi! I
take these gentlemen and this lady for judges—is this kind? is it
decent? is it manly? Do I not deserve better at his hands after having
married him and”—(a visible hitch)—“done everything in the world to
please him.”

I doubt if there were ever a more embarrassed company at a table; every
one looked like a fool; and the husband like the biggest.

“The art of Monsieur, however,” said Elvira, breaking the silence, “is
not wanting in distinction.”

“It has this distinction,” said the wife, “that nobody will buy it.”

“I should have supposed a clerkship—” began Stubbs.

“Art is Art,” swept in Léon. “I salute Art. It is the beautiful, the
divine; it is the spirit of the world, and the pride of life. But—” And
the actor paused.

“A clerkship—” began Stubbs.

“I’ll tell you what it is,” said the painter. “I am an artist, and as
this gentleman says, Art is this and the other; but of course, if my
wife is going to make my life a piece of perdition all day long, I
prefer to go and drown myself out of hand.”

“Go!” said his wife. “I should like to see you!”

“I was going to say,” resumed Stubbs, “that a fellow may be a clerk and
paint almost as much as he likes. I know a fellow in a bank who makes
capital water-colour sketches; he even sold one for seven-and-six.”

To both the women this seemed a plank of safety; each hopefully
interrogated the countenance of her lord; even Elvira, an artist
herself!—but indeed there must be something permanently mercantile in
the female nature. The two men exchanged a glance; it was tragic; not
otherwise might two philosophers salute, as at the end of a laborious
life each recognised that he was still a mystery to his disciples.

Léon arose.

“Art is Art,” he repeated sadly. “It is not water-colour sketches, nor
practising on a piano. It is a life to be lived.”

“And in the meantime people starve!” observed the woman of the house.
“If that’s a life, it is not one for me.”

“I’ll tell you what,” burst forth Léon; “you, Madame, go into another
room and talk it over with my wife; and I’ll stay here and talk it over
with your husband. It may come to nothing, but let’s try.”

“I am very willing,” replied the young woman; and she proceeded to
light a candle. “This way if you please.” And she led Elvira upstairs
into a bedroom. “The fact is,” said she, sitting down, “that my husband
cannot paint.”

“No more can mine act,” replied Elvira.

“I should have thought he could,” returned the other; “he seems
clever.”

“He is so, and the best of men besides,” said Elvira; “but he cannot
act.”

“At least he is not a sheer humbug like mine; he can at least sing.”

“You mistake Léon,” returned his wife warmly. “He does not even pretend
to sing; he has too fine a taste; he does so for a living. And, believe
me, neither of the men are humbugs. They are people with a
mission—which they cannot carry out.”

“Humbug or not,” replied the other, “you came very near passing the
night in the fields; and, for my part, I live in terror of starvation.
I should think it was a man’s mission to think twice about his wife.
But it appears not. Nothing is their mission but to play the fool. Oh!”
she broke out, “is it not something dreary to think of that man of
mine? If he could only do it, who would care? But no—not he—no more
than I can!”

“Have you any children?” asked Elvira.

“No; but then I may.”

“Children change so much,” said Elvira, with a sigh.

And just then from the room below there flew up a sudden snapping chord
on the guitar; one followed after another; then the voice of Léon
joined in; and there was an air being played and sung that stopped the
speech of the two women. The wife of the painter stood like a person
transfixed; Elvira, looking into her eyes, could see all manner of
beautiful memories and kind thoughts that were passing in and out of
her soul with every note; it was a piece of her youth that went before
her; a green French plain, the smell of apple-flowers, the far and
shining ringlets of a river, and the words and presence of love.

“Léon has hit the nail,” thought Elvira to herself. “I wonder how.”

The how was plain enough. Léon had asked the painter if there were no
air connected with courtship and pleasant times; and having learnt what
he wished, and allowed an interval to pass, he had soared forth into

“O mon amante,
O mon désir,
Sachons cueillir
L’heure charmante!”


“Pardon me, Madame,” said the painter’s wife, “your husband sings
admirably well.”

“He sings that with some feeling,” replied Elvira, critically, although
she was a little moved herself, for the song cut both ways in the upper
chamber; “but it is as an actor and not as a musician.”

“Life is very sad,” said the other; “it so wastes away under one’s
fingers.”

“I have not found it so,” replied Elvira. “I think the good parts of it
last and grow greater every day.”

“Frankly, how would you advise me?”

“Frankly, I would let my husband do what he wished. He is obviously a
very loving painter; you have not yet tried him as a clerk. And you
know—if it were only as the possible father of your children—it is as
well to keep him at his best.”

“He is an excellent fellow,” said the wife.


They kept it up till sunrise with music and all manner of good
fellowship; and at sunrise, while the sky was still temperate and
clear, they separated on the threshold with a thousand excellent wishes
for each other’s welfare. Castel-le-Gâchis was beginning to send up its
smoke against the golden East; and the church bell was ringing six.

“My guitar is a familiar spirit,” said Léon, as he and Elvira took the
nearest way towards the inn, “it resuscitated a Commissary, created an
English tourist, and reconciled a man and wife.”

Stubbs, on his part, went off into the morning with reflections of his
own.

“They are all mad,” thought he, “all mad—but wonderfully decent.”",new arabian nights,Robert Louis Stevenson
