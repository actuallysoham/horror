I.

It was languid curiosity which first brought Stephen Jones to Rogers’ Museum. Someone had
told him about the queer underground place in Southwark Street across the river, where waxen
things so much more horrible than the worst effigies at Madame Tussaud’s were shewn, and
he had strolled in one April day to see how disappointing he would find it. Oddly, he was not
disappointed. There was something different and distinctive here, after all. Of course, the
usual gory commonplaces were present—Landru, Dr. Crippen, Madame Demers, Rizzio, Lady Jane
Grey, endless maimed victims of war and revolution, and monsters like Gilles de Rais and Marquis
de Sade—but there were other things which had made him breathe faster and stay till the
ringing of the closing bell. The man who had fashioned this collection could be no ordinary
mountebank. There was imagination—even a kind of diseased genius—in some of this stuff.
Later he had learned about George Rogers. The man had been on the Tussaud staff,
but some trouble had developed which led to his discharge. There were aspersions on his sanity
and tales of his crazy forms of secret worship—though latterly his success with his own
basement museum had dulled the edge of some criticisms while sharpening the insidious point
of others. Teratology and the iconography of nightmare were his hobbies, and even he had had
the prudence to screen off some of his worst effigies in a special alcove for adults only. It
was this alcove which had fascinated Jones so much. There were lumpish hybrid things which only
fantasy could spawn, moulded with devilish skill, and coloured in a horribly life-like fashion.
Some were the figures of well-known myth—gorgons, chimaeras, dragons,
cyclops, and all their shuddersome congeners. Others were drawn from darker and more furtively
whispered cycles of subterranean legend—black, formless Tsathoggua, many-tentacled Cthulhu,
proboscidian Chaugnar Faugn, and other rumoured blasphemies from forbidden books like the 
Necronomicon, the Book of Eibon, or the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt.
But the worst were wholly original with Rogers, and represented shapes which no tale of antiquity
had ever dared to suggest. Several were hideous parodies on forms of organic life we know, while
others seemed taken from feverish dreams of other planets and other galaxies. The wilder paintings
of Clark Ashton Smith might suggest a few—but nothing could suggest the effect of poignant,
loathsome terror created by their great size and fiendishly cunning workmanship, and by the
diabolically clever lighting conditions under which they were exhibited.
Stephen Jones, as a leisurely connoisseur of the bizarre in art, had sought
out Rogers himself in the dingy office and workroom behind the vaulted museum chamber—an
evil-looking crypt lighted dimly by dusty windows set slit-like and horizontal in the brick
wall on a level with the ancient cobblestones of a hidden courtyard. It was here that the images
were repaired—here, too, where some of them had been made. Waxen arms, legs, heads, and
torsos lay in grotesque array on various benches, while on high tiers of shelves matted wigs,
ravenous-looking teeth, and glassy, staring eyes were indiscriminately scattered. Costumes of
all sorts hung from hooks, and in one alcove were great piles of flesh-coloured wax-cakes and
shelves filled with paint-cans and brushes of every description. In the centre of the room was
a large melting-furnace used to prepare the wax for moulding, its fire-box topped by a huge
iron container on hinges, with a spout which permitted the pouring of melted wax with the merest
touch of a finger.
Other things in the dismal crypt were less describable—isolated parts
of problematical entities whose assembled forms were the phantoms of delirium. At one end was
a door of heavy plank, fastened by an unusually large padlock and with a very peculiar symbol
painted over it. Jones, who had once had access to the dreaded Necronomicon, shivered
involuntarily as he recognised that symbol. This showman, he reflected, must indeed be a person
of disconcertingly wide scholarship in dark and dubious fields.
Nor did the conversation of Rogers disappoint him. The man was tall, lean,
and rather unkempt, with large black eyes which gazed combustively from a pallid and usually
stubble-covered face. He did not resent Jones’s intrusion, but seemed to welcome the chance
of unburdening himself to an interested person. His voice was of singular depth and resonance,
and harboured a sort of repressed intensity bordering on the feverish. Jones did not wonder
that many had thought him mad.
With every successive call—and such calls became a habit as the weeks
went by—Jones had found Rogers more communicative and confidential. From the first there
had been hints of strange faiths and practices on the showman’s part, and later on these
hints expanded into tales—despite a few odd corroborative photographs—whose extravagance
was almost comic. It was some time in June, on a night when Jones had brought a bottle of good
whiskey and plied his host somewhat freely, that the really demented talk first appeared. Before
that there had been wild enough stories—accounts of mysterious trips to Thibet, the African
interior, the Arabian desert, the Amazon valley, Alaska, and certain little-known islands of
the South Pacific, plus claims of having read such monstrous and half-fabulous books as the
prehistoric Pnakotic fragments and the Dhol chants attributed to malign and non-human Leng—but
nothing in all this had been so unmistakably insane as what had cropped out that June evening
under the spell of the whiskey.
To be plain, Rogers began making vague boasts of having found certain things
in Nature that no one had found before, and of having brought back tangible evidences of such
discoveries. According to his bibulous harangue, he had gone farther than anyone else in interpreting
the obscure and primal books he studied, and had been directed by them to certain remote places
where strange survivals are hidden—survivals of aeons and life-cycles earlier than mankind,
and in some cases connected with other dimensions and other worlds, communication with which
was frequent in the forgotten pre-human days. Jones marvelled at the fancy which could conjure
up such notions, and wondered just what Rogers’ mental history had been. Had his work amidst
the morbid grotesqueries of Madame Tussaud’s been the start of his imaginative flights,
or was the tendency innate, so that his choice of occupation was merely one of its manifestations?
At any rate, the man’s work was very closely linked with his notions. Even now there was
no mistaking the trend of his blackest hints about the nightmare monstrosities in the screened-off
“Adults only” alcove. Heedless of ridicule, he was trying to imply that not all of
these daemoniac abnormalities were artificial.
It was Jones’s frank scepticism and amusement at these irresponsible claims
which broke up the growing cordiality. Rogers, it was clear, took himself very seriously; for
he now became morose and resentful, continuing to tolerate Jones only through a dogged urge
to break down his wall of urbane and complacent incredulity. Wild tales and suggestions of rites
and sacrifices to nameless elder gods continued, and now and then Rogers would lead his guest
to one of the hideous blasphemies in the screened-off alcove and point out features difficult
to reconcile with even the finest human craftsmanship. Jones continued his visits through sheer
fascination, though he knew he had forfeited his host’s regard. At times he would try to
humour Rogers with pretended assent to some mad hint or assertion, but the gaunt showman was
seldom to be deceived by such tactics.
The tension came to a head later in September. Jones had casually dropped into
the museum one afternoon, and was wandering through the dim corridors whose horrors were now
so familiar, when he heard a very peculiar sound from the general direction of Rogers’
workroom. Others heard it, too, and started nervously as the echoes reverberated through the
great vaulted basement. The three attendants exchanged odd glances; and one of them, a dark,
taciturn, foreign-looking fellow who always served Rogers as a repairer and assistant designer,
smiled in a way which seemed to puzzle his colleagues and which grated very harshly on some
facet of Jones’s sensibilities. It was the yelp or scream of a dog, and was such a sound
as could be made only under conditions of the utmost fright and agony combined. Its stark, anguished
frenzy was appalling to hear, and in this setting of grotesque abnormality it held a double
hideousness. Jones remembered that no dogs were allowed in the museum.
He was about to go to the door leading into the workroom, when the dark attendant
stopped him with a word and a gesture. Mr. Rogers, the man said in a soft, somewhat accented
voice at once apologetic and vaguely sardonic, was out, and there were standing orders to admit
no one to the workroom during his absence. As for that yelp, it was undoubtedly something out
in the courtyard behind the museum. This neighbourhood was full of stray mongrels, and their
fights were sometimes shockingly noisy. There were no dogs in any part of the museum. But if
Mr. Jones wished to see Mr. Rogers he might find him just before closing-time.
After this Jones climbed the old stone steps to the street outside and examined
the squalid neighbourhood curiously. The leaning, decrepit buildings—once dwellings but
now largely shops and warehouses—were very ancient indeed. Some of them were of a gabled
type seeming to go back to Tudor times, and a faint miasmatic stench hung subtly about the whole
region. Beside the dingy house whose basement held the museum was a low archway pierced by a
dark cobbled alley, and this Jones entered in a vague wish to find the courtyard behind the
workroom and settle the affair of the dog more comfortably in his mind. The courtyard was dim
in the late afternoon light, hemmed in by rear walls even uglier and more intangibly menacing
than the crumbling street facades of the evil old houses. Not a dog was in sight, and Jones
wondered how the aftermath of such a frantic turmoil could have completely vanished so soon.
Despite the assistant’s statement that no dog had been in the museum,
Jones glanced nervously at the three small windows of the basement workroom—narrow, horizontal
rectangles close to the grass-grown pavement, with grimy panes that stared repulsively and incuriously
like the eyes of dead fish. To their left a worn flight of steps led to an opaque and heavily
bolted door. Some impulse urged him to crouch low on the damp, broken cobblestones and peer
in, on the chance that the thick green shades, worked by long cords that hung down to a reachable
level, might not be drawn. The outer surfaces were thick with dirt, but as he rubbed them with
his handkerchief he saw there was no obscuring curtain in the way of his vision.
So shadowed was the cellar from the inside that not much could be made out,
but the grotesque working paraphernalia now and then loomed up spectrally as Jones tried each
of the windows in turn. It seemed evident at first that no one was within; yet when he peered
through the extreme right-hand window—the one nearest the entrance alley—he saw a
glow of light at the farther end of the apartment which made him pause in bewilderment. There
was no reason why any light should be there. It was an inner side of the room, and he could
not recall any gas or electric fixture near that point. Another look defined the glow as a large
vertical rectangle, and a thought occurred to him. It was in that direction that he had always
noticed the heavy plank door with the abnormally large padlock—the door which was never
opened, and above which was crudely smeared that hideous cryptic symbol from the fragmentary
records of forbidden elder magic. It must be open now—and there was a light inside. All
his former speculations as to where that door led, and as to what lay behind it, were now renewed
with trebly disquieting force.
Jones wandered aimlessly around the dismal locality till close to six o’clock,
when he returned to the museum to make the call on Rogers. He could hardly tell why he wished
so especially to see the man just then, but there must have been some subconscious misgivings
about that terribly unplaceable canine scream of the afternoon, and about the glow of light
in that disturbing and usually unopened inner doorway with the heavy padlock. The attendants
were leaving as he arrived, and he thought that Orabona—the dark foreign-looking assistant—eyed
him with something like sly, repressed amusement. He did not relish that look—even though
he had seen the fellow turn it on his employer many times.
The vaulted exhibition room was ghoulish in its desertion, but he strode quickly
through it and rapped at the door of the office and workroom. Response was slow in coming, though
there were footsteps inside. Finally, in response to a second knock, the lock rattled, and the
ancient six-panelled portal creaked reluctantly open to reveal the slouching, feverish-eyed
form of George Rogers. From the first it was clear that the showman was in an unusual mood.
There was a curious mixture of reluctance and actual gloating in his welcome, and his talk at
once veered to extravagances of the most hideous and incredible sort.
Surviving elder gods—nameless sacrifices—the other than artificial
nature of some of the alcove horrors—all the usual boasts, but uttered in a tone of peculiarly
increasing confidence. Obviously, Jones reflected, the poor fellow’s madness was gaining
on him. From time to time Rogers would send furtive glances toward the heavy, padlocked inner
door at the end of the room, or toward a piece of coarse burlap on the floor not far from it,
beneath which some small object appeared to be lying. Jones grew more nervous as the moments
passed, and began to feel as hesitant about mentioning the afternoon’s oddities as he had
formerly been anxious to do so.
Rogers’ sepulchrally resonant bass almost cracked under the excitement
of his fevered rambling.
“Do you remember,” he shouted, “what I told you about that ruined
city in Indo-China where the Tcho-Tchos lived? You had to admit I’d been there when you
saw the photographs, even if you did think I made that oblong swimmer in darkness out of wax.
If you’d seen it writhing in the underground pools as I did. . . .
“Well, this is bigger still. I never told you about this, because I wanted
to work out the later parts before making any claim. When you see the snapshots you’ll
know the geography couldn’t have been faked, and I fancy I have another way of proving
that It isn’t any waxed concoction of mine. You’ve never seen it, for the experiments
wouldn’t let me keep It on exhibition.”
The showman glanced queerly at the padlocked door.
“It all comes from that long ritual in the eighth Pnakotic fragment. When
I got it figured out I saw it could have only one meaning. There were things in the north before
the land of Lomar—before mankind existed—and this was one of them. It took us all
the way to Alaska, and up the Noatak from Fort Morton, but the thing was there as we knew it
would be. Great Cyclopean ruins, acres of them. There was less left than we had hoped for, but
after three million years what could one expect? And weren’t the Esquimau legends all in
the right direction? We couldn’t get one of the beggars to go with us, and had to sledge
all the way back to Nome for Americans. Orabona was no good up in that climate—it made
him sullen and hateful.
“I’ll tell you later how we found It. When we got the ice blasted
out of the pylons of the central ruin the stairway was just as we knew it would be. Some carvings
still there, and it was no trouble keeping the Yankees from following us in. Orabona shivered
like a leaf—you’d never think it from the damned insolent way he struts around here.
He knew enough of the Elder Lore to be properly afraid. The eternal light was gone, but our
torches shewed enough. We saw the bones of others who had been before us—aeons ago, when
the climate was warm. Some of these bones were of things you couldn’t even imagine. At
the third level down we found the ivory throne the fragments said so much about—and I may
as well tell you it wasn’t empty.
“The thing on that throne didn’t move—and we knew then that
It needed the nourishment of sacrifice. But we didn’t want to wake It then. Better to get
It to London first. Orabona and I went to the surface for the big box, but when we had packed
it we couldn’t get It up the three flights of steps. These steps weren’t made for
human beings, and their size bothered us. Anyway, it was devilish heavy. We had to have the
Americans down to get It out. They weren’t anxious to go into the place, but of course
the worst thing was safely inside the box. We told them it was a batch of ivory carvings—archaeological
stuff; and after seeing the carved throne they probably believed us. It’s a wonder they
didn’t suspect hidden treasure and demand a share. They must have told queer tales around
Nome later on; though I doubt if they ever went back to those ruins, even for the ivory throne.”
Rogers paused, felt around in his desk, and produced an envelope of good-sized
photographic prints. Extracting one and laying it face down before him, he handed the rest to
Jones. The set was certainly an odd one: ice-clad hills, dog sledges, men in furs, and vast
tumbled ruins against a background of snow—ruins whose bizarre outlines and enormous stone
blocks could hardly be accounted for. One flashlight view shewed an incredible interior chamber
with wild carvings and a curious throne whose proportion could not have been designed for a
human occupant. The carvings on the gigantic masonry—high walls and peculiar vaulting overhead—were
mainly symbolic, and involved both wholly unknown designs and certain hieroglyphs darkly cited
in obscene legends. Over the throne loomed the same dreadful symbol which was now painted on
the workroom wall above the padlocked plank door. Jones darted a nervous glance at the closed
portal. Assuredly, Rogers had been to strange places and had seen strange things. Yet this mad
interior picture might easily be a fraud—taken from a very clever stage setting. One must
not be too credulous. But Rogers was continuing:
“Well, we shipped the box from Nome and got to London without any trouble.
That was the first time we’d ever brought back anything that had a chance of coming alive.
I didn’t put It on display, because there were more important things to do for It. It needed
the nourishment of sacrifice, for It was a god. Of course I couldn’t get It the sort of
sacrifices which It used to have in Its day, for such things don’t exist now. But there
were other things which might do. The blood is the life, you know. Even the lemurs and elementals
that are older than the earth will come when the blood of men or beasts is offered under the
right conditions.”
The expression on the narrator’s face was growing very alarming and repulsive,
so that Jones fidgeted involuntarily in his chair. Rogers seemed to notice his guest’s
nervousness, and continued with a distinctly evil smile.
“It was last year that I got It, and ever since then I’ve been trying
rites and sacrifices. Orabona hasn’t been much help, for he was always against the idea
of waking It. He hates It—probably because he’s afraid of what It will come to mean.
He carries a pistol all the time to protect himself—fool, as if there were human protection
against It! If I ever see him draw that pistol, I’ll strangle him. He wanted me to kill
It and make an effigy of It. But I’ve stuck by my plans, and I’m coming out on top
in spite of all the cowards like Orabona and damned sniggering sceptics like you, Jones! I’ve
chanted the rites and made certain sacrifices, and last week the transition came. The
sacrifice was—received and enjoyed!”
Rogers actually licked his lips, while Jones held himself uneasily rigid. The
showman paused and rose, crossing the room to the piece of burlap at which he had glanced so
often. Bending down, he took hold of one corner as he spoke again.
“You’ve laughed enough at my work—now it’s time for you
to get some facts. Orabona tells me you heard a dog screaming around here this afternoon. 
Do you know what that meant?”
Jones started. For all his curiosity he would have been glad to get out without
further light on the point which had so puzzled him. But Rogers was inexorable, and began to
lift the square of burlap. Beneath it lay a crushed, almost shapeless mass which Jones was slow
to classify. Was it a once-living thing which some agency had flattened, sucked dry of blood,
punctured in a thousand places, and wrung into a limp, broken-boned heap of grotesqueness? After
a moment Jones realised what it must be. It was what was left of a dog—a dog, perhaps of
considerable size and whitish colour. Its breed was past recognition, for distortion had come
in nameless and hideous ways. Most of the hair was burned off as by some pungent acid, and the
exposed, bloodless skin was riddled by innumerable circular wounds or incisions. The form of
torture necessary to cause such results was past imagining.
Electrified with a pure loathing which conquered his mounting disgust, Jones
sprang up with a cry.
“You damned sadist—you madman—you do a thing like this and dare
to speak to a decent man!”
Rogers dropped the burlap with a malignant sneer and faced his oncoming guest.
His words held an unnatural calm.
“Why, you fool, do you think I did this? Let us admit that the
results are unbeautiful from our limited human standpoint. What of it? It is not human and does
not pretend to be. To sacrifice is merely to offer. I gave the dog to It. What happened
is Its work, not mine. It needed the nourishment of the offering, and took it in Its
own way. But let me shew you what It looks like.”
As Jones stood hesitating, the speaker returned to his desk and took up the
photograph he had laid face down without shewing. Now he extended it with a curious look. Jones
took it and glanced at it in an almost mechanical way. After a moment the visitor’s glance
became sharper and more absorbed, for the utterly satanic force of the object depicted had an
almost hypnotic effect. Certainly, Rogers had outdone himself in modelling the eldritch nightmare
which the camera had caught. The thing was a work of sheer, infernal genius, and Jones wondered
how the public would react when it was placed on exhibition. So hideous a thing had no right
to exist—probably the mere contemplation of it, after it was done, had completed the unhinging
of its maker’s mind and led him to worship it with brutal sacrifices. Only a stout sanity
could resist the insidious suggestion that the blasphemy was—or had once been—some
morbid and exotic form of actual life.
The thing in the picture squatted or was balanced on what appeared to be a
clever reproduction of the monstrously carved throne in the other curious photograph. To describe
it with any ordinary vocabulary would be impossible, for nothing even roughly corresponding
to it has ever come within the imagination of sane mankind. It represented something meant perhaps
to be roughly connected with the vertebrates of this planet—though one could not be too
sure of that. Its bulk was Cyclopean, for even squatted it towered to almost twice the height
of Orabona, who was shewn beside it. Looking sharply, one might trace its approximations toward
the bodily features of the higher vertebrates.
There was an almost globular torso, with six long, sinuous limbs terminating
in crab-like claws. From the upper end a subsidiary globe bulged forward bubble-like; its triangle
of three staring, fishy eyes, its foot-long and evidently flexible proboscis, and a distended
lateral system analogous to gills, suggesting that it was a head. Most of the body was covered
with what at first appeared to be fur, but which on closer examination proved to be a dense
growth of dark, slender tentacles or sucking filaments, each tipped with a mouth suggesting
the head of an asp. On the head and below the proboscis the tentacles tended to be longer and
thicker, and marked with spiral stripes—suggesting the traditional serpent-locks of Medusa.
To say that such a thing could have an expression seems paradoxical; yet Jones felt that
that triangle of bulging fish-eyes and that obliquely poised proboscis all bespoke a blend of
hate, greed, and sheer cruelty incomprehensible to mankind because mixed with other emotions
not of the world or this solar system. Into this bestial abnormality, he reflected, Rogers must
have poured at once all his malignant insanity and all his uncanny sculptural genius. The thing
was incredible—and yet the photograph proved that it existed.
Rogers interrupted his reveries.
“Well—what do you think of It? Now do you wonder what crushed the
dog and sucked it dry with a million mouths? It needed nourishment—and It will need more.
It is a god, and I am the first priest of Its latter-day hierarchy. Iä! Shub-Niggurath!
The Goat with a Thousand Young!”
Jones lowered the photograph in disgust and pity.
“See here, Rogers, this won’t do. There are limits, you know. It’s
a great piece of work, and all that, but it isn’t good for you. Better not see it any more—let
Orabona break it up, and try to forget about it. And let me tear this beastly picture up, too.”
With a snarl, Rogers snatched the photograph and returned it to the desk.
“Idiot—you—and you still think It’s all a fraud! You still
think I made It, and you still think my figures are nothing but lifeless wax! Why, damn you,
you’re a worse clod than a wax image yourself! But I’ve got proof this time, and you’re
going to know! Not just now, for It is resting after the sacrifice—but later. Oh, yes—you
will not doubt the power of It then.”
As Rogers glanced toward the padlocked inner door Jones retrieved his hat and
stick from a nearby bench.
“Very well, Rogers, let it be later. I must be going now, but I’ll
call around tomorrow afternoon. Think my advice over and see if it doesn’t sound sensible.
Ask Orabona what he thinks, too.”
Rogers actually bared his teeth in wild-beast fashion.
“Must be going now, eh? Afraid, after all! Afraid, for all your bold talk!
You say the effigies are only wax, and yet you run away when I begin to prove that they aren’t.
You’re like the fellows who take my standing bet that they daren’t spend the night
in the museum—they come boldly enough, but after an hour they shriek and hammer to get
out! Want me to ask Orabona, eh? You two—always against me! You want to break down the
coming earthly reign of It!”
Jones preserved his calm.
“No, Rogers—there’s nobody against you. And I’m not afraid
of your figures, either, much as I admire your skill. But we’re both a bit nervous tonight,
and I fancy some rest will do us good.”
Again Rogers checked his guest’s departure.
“Not afraid, eh?—then why are you so anxious to go? Look here—do
you or don’t you dare to stay alone here in the dark? What’s your hurry if you don’t
believe in It?”
Some new idea seemed to have struck Rogers, and Jones eyed him closely.
“Why, I’ve no special hurry—but what would be gained by my staying
here alone? What would it prove? My only objection is that it isn’t very comfortable for
sleeping. What good would it do either of us?”
This time it was Jones who was struck with an idea. He continued in a tone
of conciliation.
“See here, Rogers—I’ve just asked you what it would prove if
I stayed, when we both know. It would prove that your effigies are just effigies, and that you
oughtn’t to let your imagination go the way it’s been going lately. Suppose I do
stay. If I stick it out till morning, will you agree to take a new view of things—go on
a vacation for three months or so and let Orabona destroy that new thing of yours? Come, now—isn’t
that fair?”
The expression on the showman’s face was hard to read. It was obvious
that he was thinking quickly, and that of sundry conflicting emotions, malign triumph was getting
the upper hand. His voice held a choking quality as he replied.
“Fair enough! If you do stick it out, I’ll take your advice.
But stick you must. We’ll go out for dinner and come back. I’ll lock you in the display
room and go home. In the morning I’ll come down ahead of Orabona—he comes half an
hour before the rest—and see how you are. But don’t try it unless you are very
sure of your scepticism. Others have backed out—you have that chance. And I suppose a pounding
on the outer door would always bring a constable. You may not like it so well after a while—you’ll
be in the same building, though not in the same room with It.”
As they left the rear door into the dingy courtyard, Rogers took with him the
piece of burlap—weighted with a gruesome burden. Near the centre of the court was a manhole,
whose cover the showman lifted quietly, and with a shuddersome suggestion of familiarity. Burlap
and all, the burden went down to the oblivion of a cloacal labyrinth. Jones shuddered, and almost
shrank from the gaunt figure at his side as they emerged into the street.
By unspoken mutual consent, they did not dine together, but agreed to meet
in front of the museum at eleven.
Jones hailed a cab, and breathed more freely when he had crossed Waterloo Bridge
and was approaching the brilliantly lighted Strand. He dined at a quiet café, and subsequently
went to his home in Portland Place to bathe and get a few things. Idly he wondered what Rogers
was doing. He had heard that the man had a vast, dismal house in the Walworth Road, full of
obscure and forbidden books, occult paraphernalia, and wax images which he did not choose to
place on exhibition. Orabona, he understood, lived in separate quarters in the same house.
At eleven Jones found Rogers waiting by the basement door in Southwark Street.
Their words were few, but each seemed taut with a menacing tension. They agreed that the vaulted
exhibition room alone should form the scene of the vigil, and Rogers did not insist that the
watcher sit in the special adult alcove of supreme horrors. The showman, having extinguished
all the lights with switches in the workroom, locked the door of that crypt with one of the
keys on his crowded ring. Without shaking hands he passed out the street door, locked it after
him, and stamped up the worn steps to the sidewalk outside. As his tread receded, Jones realised
that the long, tedious vigil had commenced.
II.

Later, in the utter blackness of the great arched cellar, Jones cursed the
childish naiveté which had brought him there. For the first half-hour he had kept flashing
on his pocket-light at intervals, but now just sitting in the dark on one of the visitors’
benches had become a more nerve-racking thing. Every time the beam shot out it lighted up some
morbid, grotesque object—a guillotine, a nameless hybrid monster, a pasty-bearded face
crafty with evil, a body with red torrents streaming from a severed throat. Jones knew that
no sinister reality was attached to these things, but after that first half-hour he preferred
not to see them.
Why he had bothered to humour that madman he could scarcely imagine. It would
have been much simpler merely to have let him alone, or to have called in a mental specialist.
Probably, he reflected, it was the fellow-feeling of one artist for another. There was so much
genius in Rogers that he deserved every possible chance to be helped quietly out of his growing
mania. Any man who could imagine and construct the incredibly life-like things that he had produced
was surely not far from actual greatness. He had the fancy of a Sime or a Doré joined
to the minute, scientific craftsmanship of a Blatschka. Indeed, he had done for the world of
nightmare what the Blatschkas with their marvellously accurate plant models of finely wrought
and coloured glass had done for the world of botany.
At midnight the strokes of a distant clock filtered through the darkness, and
Jones felt cheered by the message from a still-surviving outside world. The vaulted museum chamber
was like a tomb—ghastly in its utter solitude. Even a mouse would be cheering company;
yet Rogers had once boasted that—for “certain reasons”, as he said—no mice
or even insects ever came near the place. That was very curious, yet it seemed to be true. The
deadness and silence were virtually complete. If only something would make a sound! He shuffled
his feet, and the echoes came spectrally out of the absolute stillness. He coughed, but there
was something mocking in the staccato reverberations. He could not, he vowed, begin talking
to himself. That meant nervous disintegration. Time seemed to pass with abnormal and disconcerting
slowness. He could have sworn that hours had elapsed since he last flashed the light on his
watch, yet here was only the stroke of midnight.
He wished that his senses were not so preternaturally keen. Something in the
darkness and stillness seemed to have sharpened them, so that they responded to faint intimations
hardly strong enough to be called true impressions. His ears seemed at times to catch a faint,
elusive susurrus which could not quite be identified with the nocturnal hum of the squalid
streets outside, and he thought of vague, irrelevant things like the music of the spheres and
the unknown, inaccessible life of alien dimensions pressing on our own. Rogers often speculated
about such things.
The floating specks of light in his blackness-drowned eyes seemed inclined
to take on curious symmetries of pattern and motion. He had often wondered about those strange
rays from the unplumbed abyss which scintillate before us in the absence of all earthly illumination,
but he had never known any that behaved just as these were behaving. They lacked the restful
aimlessness of ordinary light-specks—suggesting some will and purpose remote from any terrestrial
conception.
Then there was that suggestion of odd stirrings. Nothing was open, yet in spite
of the general draughtlessness Jones felt that the air was not uniformly quiet. There were intangible
variations in pressure—not quite decided enough to suggest the loathsome pawings of unseen
elementals. It was abnormally chilly, too. He did not like any of this. The air tasted salty,
as if it were mixed with the brine of dark subterrene waters, and there was a bare hint of some
odour of ineffable mustiness. In the daytime he had never noticed that the waxen figures had
an odour. Even now that half-received hint was not the way wax figures ought to smell. It was
more like the faint smell of specimens in a natural-history museum. Curious, in view of Rogers’
claims that his figures were not all artificial—indeed, it was probably that claim which
made one’s imagination conjure up the olfactory suspicion. One must guard against excesses
of the imagination—had not such things driven poor Rogers mad?
But the utter loneliness of this place was frightful. Even the distant chimes
seemed to come from across cosmic gulfs. It made Jones think of that insane picture which Rogers
had shewed him—the wildly carved chamber with the cryptic throne which the fellow had claimed
was part of a three-million-year-old ruin in the shunned and inaccessible solitudes of the Arctic.
Perhaps Rogers had been to Alaska, but that picture was certainly nothing but stage scenery.
It couldn’t normally be otherwise, with all that carving and those terrible symbols. And
that monstrous shape supposed to have been found on that throne—what a flight of diseased
fancy! Jones wondered just how far he actually was from the insane masterpiece in wax—probably
it was kept behind that heavy, padlocked plank door leading somewhere out of the workroom. But
it would never do to brood about a waxen image. Was not the present room full of such things,
some of them scarcely less horrible than the dreadful “IT”? And beyond a thin canvas
screen on the left was the “Adults only” alcove with its nameless phantoms of delirium.
The proximity of the numberless waxen shapes began to get on Jones’s nerves
more and more as the quarter-hours wore on. He knew the museum so well that he could not get
rid of their usual images even in the total darkness. Indeed, the darkness had the effect of
adding to the remembered images certain very disturbing imaginative overtones. The guillotine
seemed to creak, and the bearded face of Landru—slayer of his fifty wives—twisted
itself into expressions of monstrous menace. From the severed throat of Madame Demers a hideous
bubbling sound seemed to emanate, while the headless, legless victim of a trunk murder tried
to edge closer and closer on its gory stumps. Jones began shutting his eyes to see if that would
dim the images, but found it was useless. Besides, when he shut his eyes the strange, purposeful
patterns of light-specks became more disturbingly pronounced.
Then suddenly he began trying to keep the hideous images he had formerly been
trying to banish. He tried to keep them because they were giving place to still more hideous
ones. In spite of himself his memory began reconstructing the utterly non-human blasphemies
that lurked in the obscurer corners, and these lumpish hybrid growths oozed and wriggled toward
him as though hunting him down in a circle. Black Tsathoggua moulded itself from a toad-like
gargoyle to a long, sinuous line with hundreds of rudimentary feet, and a lean, rubbery night-gaunt
spread its wings as if to advance and smother the watcher. Jones braced himself to keep from
screaming. He knew he was reverting to the traditional terrors of his childhood, and resolved
to use his adult reason to keep the phantoms at bay. It helped a bit, he found, to flash the
light again. Frightful as were the images it shewed, these were not as bad as what his fancy
called out of the utter blackness.
But there were drawbacks. Even in the light of his torch he could not help
suspecting a slight, furtive trembling on the part of the canvas partition screening off the
terrible “Adults only” alcove. He knew what lay beyond, and shivered. Imagination
called up the shocking form of fabulous Yog-Sothoth—only a congeries of iridescent globes,
yet stupendous in its malign suggestiveness. What was this accursed mass slowly floating toward
him and bumping on the partition that stood in the way? A small bulge in the canvas far to the
right suggested the sharp horn of Gnoph-keh, the hairy myth-thing of the Greenland ice, that
walked sometimes on two legs, sometimes on four, and sometimes on six. To get this stuff out
of his head Jones walked boldly toward the hellish alcove with torch burning steadily. Of course,
none of his fears was true. Yet were not the long, facial tentacles of great Cthulhu actually
swaying, slowly and insidiously? He knew they were flexible, but he had not realised that the
draught caused by his advance was enough to set them in motion.
Returning to his former seat outside the alcove, he shut his eyes and let the
symmetrical light-specks do their worst. The distant clock boomed a single stroke. Could it
be only one? He flashed the light on his watch and saw that it was precisely that hour. It would
be hard indeed waiting for morning. Rogers would be down at about eight o’clock, ahead
of even Orabona. It would be light outside in the main basement long before that, but none of
it could penetrate here. All the windows in this basement had been bricked up but the three
small ones facing the court. A pretty bad wait, all told.
His ears were getting most of the hallucinations now—for he could swear
he heard stealthy, plodding footsteps in the workroom beyond the closed and locked door. He
had no business thinking of that unexhibited horror which Rogers called “It”. The
thing was a contamination—it had driven its maker mad, and now even its picture was calling
up imaginative terrors. It could not be in the workroom—it was very obviously beyond that
padlocked door of heavy planking. Those steps were certainly pure imagination.
Then he thought he heard the key turn in the workroom door. Flashing on his
torch, he saw nothing but the ancient six-panelled portal in its proper position. Again he tried
darkness and closed eyes, but there followed a harrowing illusion of creaking—not the guillotine
this time, but the slow, furtive opening of the workroom door. He would not scream. Once he
screamed, he would be lost. There was a sort of padding or shuffling audible now, and it was
slowly advancing toward him. He must retain command of himself. Had he not done so when the
nameless brain-shapes tried to close in on him? The shuffling crept nearer, and his resolution
failed. He did not scream but merely gulped out a challenge.
“Who goes there? Who are you? What do you want?”
There was no answer, but the shuffling kept on. Jones did not know which he
feared most to do—turn on his flashlight or stay in the dark while the thing crept upon
him. This thing was different, he felt profoundly, from the other terrors of the evening. His
fingers and throat worked spasmodically. Silence was impossible, and the suspense of utter blackness
was beginning to be the most intolerable of all conditions. Again he cried out hysterically—“Halt!
Who goes there?”—as he switched on the revealing beams of his torch. Then, paralysed
by what he saw, he dropped the flashlight and screamed—not once but many times.
Shuffling toward him in the darkness was the gigantic, blasphemous form of
a black thing not wholly ape and not wholly insect. Its hide hung loosely upon its frame, and
its rugose, dead-eyed rudiment of a head swayed drunkenly from side to side. Its fore paws were
extended, with talons spread wide, and its whole body was taut with murderous malignity despite
its utter lack of facial expression. After the screams and the final coming of darkness it leaped,
and in a moment had Jones pinned to the floor. There was no struggle, for the watcher had fainted.
Jones’s fainting spell could not have lasted more than a moment, for the
nameless thing was apishly dragging him through the darkness when he began recovering consciousness.
What started him fully awake were the sounds which the thing was making—or rather, the
voice with which it was making them. That voice was human, and it was familiar. Only one living
being could be behind the hoarse, feverish accents which were chanting to an unknown horror.
“Iä! Iä!” it was howling. “I am coming, O Rhan-Tegoth,
coming with the nourishment. You have waited long and fed ill, but now you shall have what was
promised. That and more, for instead of Orabona it will be one of high degree who had doubted
you. You shall crush and drain him, with all his doubts, and grow strong thereby. And ever after
among men he shall be shewn as a monument to your glory. Rhan-Tegoth, infinite and invincible,
I am your slave and high-priest. You are hungry, and I provide. I read the sign and have led
you forth. I shall feed you with blood, and you shall feed me with power. Iä! Shub-Niggurath!
The Goat with a Thousand Young!”
In an instant all the terrors of the night dropped from Jones like a discarded
cloak. He was again master of his mind, for he knew the very earthly and material peril he had
to deal with. This was no monster of fable, but a dangerous madman. It was Rogers, dressed in
some nightmare covering of his own insane designing, and about to make a frightful sacrifice
to the devil-god he had fashioned out of wax. Clearly, he must have entered the workroom from
the rear courtyard, donned his disguise, and then advanced to seize his neatly trapped and fear-broken
victim. His strength was prodigious, and if he was to be thwarted, one must act quickly. Counting
on the madman’s confidence in his unconsciousness he determined to take him by surprise,
while his grasp was relatively lax. The feel of a threshold told him he was crossing into the
pitch-black workroom.
With the strength of mortal fear Jones made a sudden spring from the half-recumbent
posture in which he was being dragged. For an instant he was free of the astonished maniac’s
hands, and in another instant a lucky lunge in the dark had put his own hands at his captor’s
weirdly concealed throat. Simultaneously Rogers gripped him again, and without further preliminaries
the two were locked in a desperate struggle of life and death. Jones’s athletic training,
without doubt, was his sole salvation; for his mad assailant, freed from every inhibition of
fair play, decency, or even self-preservation, was an engine of savage destruction as formidable
as a wolf or panther.
Guttural cries sometimes punctured the hideous tussle in the dark. Blood spurted,
clothing ripped, and Jones at last felt the actual throat of the maniac, shorn of its spectral
mask. He spoke not a word, but put every ounce of energy into the defence of his life. Rogers
kicked, gouged, butted, bit, clawed, and spat—yet found strength to yelp out actual sentences
at times. Most of his speech was in a ritualistic jargon full of references to “It”
or “Rhan-Tegoth”, and to Jones’s overwrought nerves it seemed as if the cries
echoed from an infinite distance of daemoniac snortings and bayings. Toward the last they were
rolling on the floor, overturning benches or striking against the walls and the brick foundations
of the central melting-furnace. Up to the very end Jones could not be certain of saving himself,
but chance finally intervened in his favour. A jab of his knee against Rogers’ chest produced
a general relaxation, and a moment later he knew he had won.
Though hardly able to hold himself up, Jones rose and stumbled about the walls
seeking the light-switch—for his flashlight was gone, together with most of his clothing.
As he lurched along he dragged his limp opponent with him, fearing a sudden attack when the
madman came to. Finding the switch-box, he fumbled till he had the right handle. Then, as the
wildly disordered workroom burst into sudden radiance, he set about binding Rogers with such
cords and belts as he could easily find. The fellow’s disguise—or what was left of
it—seemed to be made of a puzzlingly queer sort of leather. For some reason it made Jones’s
flesh crawl to touch it, and there seemed to be an alien, rusty odour about it. In the normal
clothes beneath it was Rogers’ key-ring, and this the exhausted victor seized as his final
passport to freedom. The shades at the small, slit-like windows were all securely drawn, and
he let them remain so.
Washing off the blood of battle at a convenient sink, Jones donned the most
ordinary-looking and least ill-fitting clothes he could find on the costume hooks. Testing the
door to the courtyard, he found it fastened with a spring-lock which did not require a key from
the inside. He kept the key-ring, however, to admit him on his return with aid—for plainly,
the thing to do was to call in an alienist. There was no telephone in the museum, but it would
not take long to find an all-night restaurant or chemist’s shop where one could be had.
He had almost opened the door to go when a torrent of hideous abuse from across the room told
him that Rogers—whose visible injuries were confined to a long, deep scratch down the left
cheek—had regained consciousness.
“Fool! Spawn of Noth-Yidik and effluvium of K’thun! Son of the dogs
that howl in the maelstrom of Azathoth! You would have been sacred and immortal, and now you
are betraying It and Its priest! Beware—for It is hungry! It would have been Orabona—that
damned treacherous dog ready to turn against me and It—but I give you the first honour
instead. Now you must both beware, for It is not gentle without Its priest.
“Iä! Iä! Vengeance is at hand! Do you know you would have been
immortal? Look at the furnace! There is a fire ready to light, and there is wax in the kettle.
I would have done with you as I have done with other once-living forms. Hei! You, who have vowed
all my effigies are waxen, would have become a waxen effigy yourself! The furnace was all ready!
When It had had Its fill, and you were like that dog I shewed you, I would have made your flattened,
punctured fragments immortal! Wax would have done it. Haven’t you said I’m a great
artist? Wax in every pore—wax over every square inch of you—Iä! Iä! And
ever after the world would have looked at your mangled carcass and wondered how I ever imagined
and made such a thing! Hei! And Orabona would have come next, and others after him—and
thus would my waxen family have grown!
“Dog—do you still think I made all my effigies? Why not say
preserved? You know by this time the strange places I’ve been to, and the strange
things I’ve brought back. Coward—you could never face the dimensional shambler whose
hide I put on to scare you—the mere sight of it alive, or even the full-fledged thought
of it, would kill you instantly with fright! Iä! Iä! It waits hungry for the blood
that is the life!”
Rogers, propped against the wall, swayed to and fro in his bonds.
“See here, Jones—if I let you go will you let me go? It must be taken
care of by Its high-priest. Orabona will be enough to keep It alive—and when he is finished
I will make his fragments immortal in wax for the world to see. It could have been you, but
you have rejected the honour. I won’t bother you again. Let me go, and I will share with
you the power that It will bring me. Iä! Iä! Great is Rhan-Tegoth! Let me go! Let
me go! It is starving down there beyond that door, and if It dies the Old Ones can never come
back. Hei! Hei! Let me go!”
Jones merely shook his head, though the hideousness of the showman’s imaginings
revolted him. Rogers, now staring wildly at the padlocked plank door, thumped his head again
and again against the brick wall and kicked with his tightly bound ankles. Jones was afraid
he would injure himself, and advanced to bind him more firmly to some stationary object. Writhing,
Rogers edged away from him and set up a series of frenetic ululations whose utter, monstrous
unhumanness was appalling, and whose sheer volume was almost incredible. It seemed impossible
that any human throat could produce noises so loud and piercing, and Jones felt that if this
continued there would be no need to telephone for aid. It could not be long before a constable
would investigate, even granting that there were no listening neighbours in this deserted warehouse
district.
“Wza-y’ei! Wza-y’ei!” howled the madman. “Y’kaa
haa bho—ii, Rhan-Tegoth—Cthulhu fhtagn—Ei! Ei! Ei! Ei!—Rhan-Tegoth, Rhan-Tegoth,
Rhan-Tegoth!”
The tautly trussed creature, who had started squirming his way across the littered
floor, now reached the padlocked plank door and commenced knocking his head thunderously against
it. Jones dreaded the task of binding him further, and wished he were not so exhausted from
the previous struggle. This violent aftermath was getting hideously on his nerves, and he began
to feel a return of the nameless qualms he had felt in the dark. Everything about Rogers and
his museum was so hellishly morbid and suggestive of black vistas beyond life! It was loathsome
to think of the waxen masterpiece of abnormal genius which must at this very moment be lurking
close at hand in the blackness beyond the heavy, padlocked door.
And now something happened which sent an additional chill down Jones’s
spine, and caused every hair—even the tiny growth on the backs of his hands—to bristle
with a vague fright beyond classification. Rogers had suddenly stopped screaming and beating
his head against the stout plank door, and was straining up to a sitting posture, head cocked
on one side as if listening intently for something. All at once a smile of devilish triumph
overspread his face, and he began speaking intelligibly again—this time in a hoarse whisper
contrasting oddly with his former stentorian howling.
“Listen, fool! Listen hard! It has heard me, and is coming. Can’t
you hear It splashing out of Its tank down there at the end of the runway? I dug it deep, because
there was nothing too good for It. It is amphibious, you know—you saw the gills in the
picture. It came to the earth from lead-grey Yuggoth, where the cities are under the warm deep
sea. It can’t stand up in there—too tall—has to sit or crouch. Let me get my
keys—we must let It out and kneel down before It. Then we will go out and find a dog or
cat—or perhaps a drunken man—to give It the nourishment It needs.”
It was not what the madman said, but the way he said it, that disorganised
Jones so badly. The utter, insane confidence and sincerity in that crazed whisper were damnably
contagious. Imagination, with such a stimulus, could find an active menace in the devilish wax
figure that lurked unseen just beyond the heavy planking. Eyeing the door in unholy fascination,
Jones noticed that it bore several distinct cracks, though no marks of violent treatment were
visible on this side. He wondered how large a room or closet lay behind it, and how the waxen
figure was arranged. The maniac’s idea of a tank and runway was as clever as all his other
imaginings.
Then, in one terrible instant, Jones completely lost the power to draw a breath.
The leather belt he had seized for Rogers’ further strapping fell from his limp hands,
and a spasm of shivering convulsed him from head to foot. He might have known the place would
drive him mad as it had driven Rogers—and now he was mad. He was mad, for he now
harboured hallucinations more weird than any which had assailed him earlier that night. The
madman was bidding him hear the splashing of a mythical monster in a tank beyond the door—and
now, God help him, he did hear it!
Rogers saw the spasm of horror reach Jones’s face and transform it to
a staring mask of fear. He cackled.
“At last, fool, you believe! At last you know! You hear It and It comes!
Get me my keys, fool—we must do homage and serve It!”
But Jones was past paying attention to any human words, mad or sane. Phobic
paralysis held him immobile and half-conscious, with wild images racing phantasmagorically through
his helpless imagination. There was a splashing. There was a padding or shuffling,
as of great wet paws on a solid surface. Something was approaching. Into his nostrils,
from the cracks in that nightmare plank door, poured a noisome animal stench like and yet unlike
that of the mammal cages at the zoölogical gardens in Regent’s Park.
He did not know now whether Rogers was talking or not. Everything real had
faded away, and he was a statue obsessed with dreams and hallucinations so unnatural that they
became almost objective and remote from him. He thought he heard a sniffing or snorting from
the unknown gulf beyond the door, and when a sudden baying, trumpeting noise assailed his ears
he could not feel sure that it came from the tightly bound maniac whose image swam uncertainly
in his shaken vision. The photograph of that accursed, unseen wax thing persisted in floating
through his consciousness. Such a thing had no right to exist. Had it not driven him mad?
Even as he reflected, a fresh evidence of madness beset him. Something, he
thought, was fumbling with the latch of the heavy padlocked door. It was patting and pawing
and pushing at the planks. There was a thudding on the stout wood, which grew louder and louder.
The stench was horrible. And now the assault on that door from the inside was a malign, determined
pounding like the strokes of a battering-ram. There was an ominous cracking—a splintering—a
welling foetor—a falling plank—a black paw ending in a crab-like claw. . . .
“Help! Help! God help me! . . . Aaaaaaa! . . .”
With intense effort Jones is today able to recall a sudden bursting of his
fear-paralysis into the liberation of frenzied automatic flight. What he evidently did must
have paralleled curiously the wild, plunging flights of maddest nightmares; for he seems to
have leaped across the disordered crypt at almost a single bound, yanked open the outside door,
which closed and locked itself after him with a clatter, sprung up the worn stone steps three
at a time, and raced frantically and aimlessly out of that dank cobblestoned court and through
the squalid streets of Southwark.
Here the memory ends. Jones does not know how he got home, and there is no
evidence of his having hired a cab. Probably he raced all the way by blind instinct—over
Waterloo Bridge, along the Strand and Charing Cross, and up Haymarket and Regent Street to his
own neighbourhood. He still had on the queer mélange of museum costumes when he grew
conscious enough to call the doctor.
A week later the nerve specialists allowed him to leave his bed and walk in
the open air.
But he had not told the specialists much. Over his whole experience hung a
pall of madness and nightmare, and he felt that silence was the only course. When he was up,
he scanned intently all the papers which had accumulated since that hideous night, but found
no reference to anything queer at the museum. How much, after all, had been reality? Where did
reality end and morbid dream begin? Had his mind gone wholly to pieces in that dark exhibition
chamber, and had the whole fight with Rogers been a phantasm of fever? It would help to put
him on his feet if he could settle some of these maddening points. He must have seen
that damnable photograph of the wax image called “It”, for no brain but Rogers’
could ever have conceived such a blasphemy.
It was a fortnight before he dared to enter Southwark Street again. He went
in the middle of the morning, when there was the greatest amount of sane, wholesome activity
around the ancient, crumbling shops and warehouses. The museum’s sign was still there,
and as he approached he saw that the place was open. The gateman nodded in a pleasant recognition
as he summoned up the courage to enter, and in the vaulted chamber below an attendant touched
his cap cheerfully. Perhaps everything had been a dream. Would he dare to knock at the door
of the workroom and look for Rogers?
Then Orabona advanced to greet him. His dark, sleek face was a trifle sardonic,
but Jones felt that he was not unfriendly. He spoke with a trace of accent.
“Good morning, Mr. Jones. It is some time since we have seen you here.
Did you wish Mr. Rogers? I’m sorry, but he is away. He had word of business in America,
and had to go. Yes, it was very sudden. I am in charge now—here, and at the house. I try
to maintain Mr. Rogers’ high standard—till he is back.”
The foreigner smiled—perhaps from affability alone. Jones scarcely knew
how to reply, but managed to mumble out a few inquiries about the day after his last visit.
Orabona seemed greatly amused by the questions, and took considerable care in framing his replies.
“Oh, yes, Mr. Jones—the twenty-eighth of last month. I remember it
for many reasons. In the morning—before Mr. Rogers got here, you understand—I found
the workroom in quite a mess. There was a great deal of—cleaning up—to do. There had
been—late work, you see. Important new specimen given its secondary baking process. I took
complete charge when I came.
“It was a hard specimen to prepare—but of course Mr. Rogers has taught
me a great deal. He is, as you know, a very great artist. When he came he helped me complete
the specimen—helped very materially, I assure you—but he left soon without even greeting
the men. As I tell you, he was called away suddenly. There were important chemical reactions
involved. They made loud noises—in fact, some teamsters in the court outside fancy they
heard several pistol shots—very amusing idea!
“As for the new specimen—that matter is very unfortunate. It is a
great masterpiece—designed and made, you understand, by Mr. Rogers. He will see about it
when he gets back.”
Again Orabona smiled.
“The police, you know. We put it on display a week ago, and there were
two or three faintings. One poor fellow had an epileptic fit in front of it. You see, it is
a trifle—stronger—than the rest. Larger, for one thing. Of course, it was in the adult
alcove. The next day a couple of men from Scotland Yard looked it over and said it was too morbid
to be shewn. Said we’d have to remove it. It was a tremendous shame—such a masterpiece
of art—but I didn’t feel justified in appealing to the courts in Mr. Rogers’
absence. He would not like so much publicity with the police now—but when he gets back—when
he gets back—“
For some reason or other Jones felt a mounting tide of uneasiness and repulsion.
But Orabona was continuing.
“You are a connoisseur, Mr. Jones. I am sure I violate no law in offering
you a private view. It may be—subject, of course, to Mr. Rogers’ wishes—that
we shall destroy the specimen some day—but that would be a crime.”
Jones had a powerful impulse to refuse the sight and flee precipitately, but
Orabona was leading him forward by the arm with an artist’s enthusiasm. The adult alcove,
crowded with nameless horrors, held no visitors. In the farther corner a large niche had been
curtained off, and to this the smiling assistant advanced.
“You must know, Mr. Jones, that the title of this specimen is ‘The
Sacrifice to Rhan-Tegoth’.”
Jones started violently, but Orabona appeared not to notice.
“The shapeless, colossal god is a feature in certain obscure legends which
Mr. Rogers has studied. All nonsense, of course, as you’ve so often assured Mr. Rogers.
It is supposed to have come from outer space, and to have lived in the Arctic three million
years ago. It treated its sacrifices rather peculiarly and horribly, as you shall see. Mr. Rogers
had made it fiendishly life-like—even to the face of the victim.”
Now trembling violently, Jones clung to the brass railing in front of the curtained
niche. He almost reached out to stop Orabona when he saw the curtain beginning to swing aside,
but some conflicting impulse held him back. The foreigner smiled triumphantly.
“Behold!”
Jones reeled in spite of his grip on the railing.
“God!—great God!”
Fully ten feet high despite a shambling, crouching attitude expressive of infinite
cosmic malignancy, a monstrosity of unbelievable horror was shewn starting forward from a Cyclopean
ivory throne covered with grotesque carvings. In the central pair of its six legs it bore a
crushed, flattened, distorted, bloodless thing, riddled with a million punctures, and in places
seared as with some pungent acid. Only the mangled head of the victim, lolling upside down at
one side, revealed that it represented something once human.
The monster itself needed no title for one who had seen a certain hellish photograph.
That damnable print had been all too faithful; yet it could not carry the full horror which
lay in the gigantic actuality. The globular torso—the bubble-like suggestion of a head—the
three fishy eyes—the foot-long proboscis—the bulging gills—the monstrous capillation
of asp-like suckers—the six sinuous limbs with their black paws and crab-like claws—God!
the familiarity of that black paw ending in a crab-like claw! . . .
Orabona’s smile was utterly damnable. Jones choked, and stared at the
hideous exhibit with a mounting fascination which perplexed and disturbed him. What half-revealed
horror was holding and forcing him to look longer and search out details? This had driven Rogers
mad . . . Rogers, supreme artist . . . said they weren’t
artificial. . . .
Then he localised the thing that held him. It was the crushed waxen victim’s
lolling head, and something that it implied. This head was not entirely devoid of a face, and
that face was familiar. It was like the mad face of poor Rogers. Jones peered closer, hardly
knowing why he was driven to do so. Wasn’t it natural for a mad egotist to mould his own
features into his masterpiece? Was there anything more that subconscious vision had seized on
and suppressed in sheer terror?
The wax of the mangled face had been handled with boundless dexterity. Those
punctures—how perfectly they reproduced the myriad wounds somehow inflicted on that poor
dog! But there was something more. On the left cheek one could trace an irregularity which seemed
outside the general scheme—as if the sculptor had sought to cover up a defect of his first
modelling. The more Jones looked at it, the more mysteriously it horrified him—and then,
suddenly, he remembered a circumstance which brought his horror to a head. That night of hideousness—the
tussle—the bound madman—and the long, deep scratch down the left cheek of the actual
living Rogers. . . .
Jones, releasing his desperate clutch on the railing, sank in a total faint.
Orabona continued to smile.
",the horror in the museum,HP Lovecraft
"Moon-madness? A touch of fever? I wish I could think so! But when I am alone after dark in the
waste places where my wanderings take me, and hear across infinite voids the demon echoes of
those screams and snarls, and that detestable crunching of bones, I shudder again at the memory
of that eldritch night.
I knew less of woodcraft in those days, though the wilderness called just as
strongly to me as it does now. Up to that night I had always been careful to employ a guide,
but circumstances now suddenly forced me to a trial of my own skill. It was midsummer in Maine,
and, despite my great need to get from Mayfair to Glendale by the next noon, I could find no
person willing to pilot me. Unless I took the long route through Potowisset, which would not
bring me to my goal in time, there would be dense forests to penetrate; yet whenever I asked
for a guide I was met with refusal and evasion.
Stranger that I was, it seemed odd that everyone should have glib excuses.
There was too much “important business” on hand for such a sleepy village, and I knew
that the natives were lying. But they all had “imperative duties”, or said that they
had; and would do no more than assure me that the trail through the woods was very plain, running
due north, and not in the least difficult for a vigorous young fellow. If I started while the
morning was still early, they averred, I could get to Glendale by sundown and avoid a night
in the open. Even then I suspected nothing. The prospect seemed good, and I resolved to try
it alone, let the lazy villagers hang back as they might. Probably I would have tried it even
if I had suspected; for youth is stubborn, and from childhood I had only laughed at superstition
and old wives’ tales.
So before the sun was high I had started off through the trees at a swinging
stride, lunch in my hand, guardian automatic in my pocket, and belt filled with crisp bills
of large denominations. From the distances given me and a knowledge of my own speed, I had figured
on making Glendale a little after sunset; but I knew that even if detained over night through
some miscalculation, I had plenty of camping experience to fall back on. Besides, my presence
at my destination was not really necessary till the following noon.
It was the weather that set my plans awry. As the sun rose higher, it scorched
through even the thickest of the foliage, and burned up my energy at every step. By noon my
clothes were soaking with perspiration, and I felt myself faltering in spite of all my resolution.
As I pushed deeper into the woods I found the trail greatly obstructed with underbrush, and
at many points nearly effaced. It must have been weeks—perhaps months—since anyone
had broken his way through; and I began to wonder if I could, after all, live up to my schedule.
At length, having grown very hungry, I looked for the deepest patch of shade
I could find, and proceeded to eat the lunch which the hotel had prepared for me. There were
some indifferent sandwiches, a piece of stale pie, and a bottle of very light wine; by no means
sumptuous fare, but welcome enough to one in my state of overheated exhaustion.
It was too hot for smoking to be of any solace, so I did not take out my pipe.
Instead, I stretched myself at full length under the trees when my meal was done, intent on
stealing a few moments’ rest before commencing the last lap of my journey. I suppose I
was a fool to drink that wine; for, light though it was, it proved just enough to finish the
work the sultry, oppressive day had begun. My plan called for the merest momentary relaxation,
yet, with scarcely a warning yawn, I dropped off into a sound slumber.
II.

When I opened my eyes twilight was closing in about me. A wind fanned my cheeks,
restoring me quickly to full perception; and as I glanced up at the sky I saw with apprehension
that black racing clouds were leading on a solid wall of darkness prophetic of violent thunderstorm.
I knew now that I could not reach Glendale before morning, but the prospect of a night in the
woods—my first night of lone forest camping—became very repugnant under these trying
conditions. In a moment I decided to push along for a while at least, in the hope of finding
some shelter before the tempest should break.
Darkness spread over the woods like a heavy blanket. The lowering clouds grew
more threatening, and the wind increased to a veritable gale. A flash of distant lightning illuminated
the sky, followed by an ominous rumble that seemed to hint of malign pursuit. Then I felt a
drop of rain on my outstretched hand; and though still walking on automatically, resigned myself
to the inevitable. Another moment and I had seen the light; the light of a window through the
trees and the darkness. Eager only for shelter, I hastened toward it—would to God I had
turned and fled!
There was a sort of imperfect clearing, on the farther side of which, with
its back against the primeval wood, stood a building. I had expected a shanty or log-cabin,
but stopped short in surprise when I beheld a neat and tasteful little house of two stories;
some seventy years old by its architecture, yet still in a state of repair betokening the closest
and most civilized attention. Through the small panes of one of the lower windows a bright light
shone, and toward this—spurred by the impact of another raindrop—I presently hurried
across the clearing, rapping loudly on the doors as soon as I gained the steps.
With startling promptness my knock was answered by a deep, pleasant voice which
uttered the single syllable, “Come!”
Pushing open the unlocked door, I entered a shadowy hall lighted by an open
doorway at the right, beyond which was a book-lined room with the gleaming window. As I closed
the outer door behind me I could not help noticing a peculiar odor about the house; a faint,
elusive, scarcely definable odor which somehow suggested animals. My host, I surmised, must
be a hunter or trapper, with his business conducted on the premises.
The man who had spoken sat in a capacious easy-chair beside a marble-topped
center table, a long lounging-robe of gray swathing his lean form. The light from a powerful
argand lamp threw his features into prominence, and as he eyed me curiously I studied him in
no less detail. He was strikingly handsome, with thin, clean-shaven face, glossy, flaxen hair
neatly brushed, long, regular eyebrows that met in a slanting angle above the nose, shapely
ears set low and well back on the head, and large expressive gray eyes almost luminous in their
animation. When he smiled a welcome he showed a magnificently even set of firm white teeth,
and as he waved me to a chair I was struck by the fineness of his slender hands, with their
long, tapering fingers whose ruddy, almond-shaped nails were slightly curved and exquisitely
manicured. I could not help wondering why a man of such engaging personality should choose the
life of a recluse.
“Sorry to intrude,” I ventured, “but I’ve given up the
hope of making Glendale before morning, and there’s a storm coming on which sent me looking
for cover.” As if to corroborate my words, there came at this point a vivid flash, a crashing
reverberation, and the first breaking of a torrential downpour that beat maniacally against
the windows.
My host seemed oblivious to the elements, and flashed me another smile when
he answered. His voice was soothing and well modulated, and his eyes held a calmness almost
hypnotic.
“You’re welcome to whatever hospitality I can offer, but I’m
afraid it won’t be much. I’ve a game leg, so you’ll have to do most of the waiting
on yourself. If you’re hungry you’ll find plenty in the kitchen—plenty of food,
if not of ceremony!” It seemed to me that I could detect the slightest trace of a foreign
accent in his tone, though his language was fluently correct and idiomatic.
Rising to an impressive height, he headed for the door with long, limping steps,
and I noticed the huge hairy arms that hung at his side in such curious contrast with his delicate
hands.
“Come,” he suggested. “Bring the lamp along with you. I might
as well sit in the kitchen as here.”
I followed him into the hall and the room across it, and at his direction ransacked
the woodpile in the corner and the cupboard on the wall. A few moments later, when the fire
was going nicely, I asked him if I might not prepare food for both; but he courteously declined.
“It’s too hot to eat,” he told me. ‘Besides, I had a bite
before you came.”
After washing the dishes left from my lone meal, I sat down for a while, smoking
my pipe contentedly. My host asked a few questions about the neighboring villages, but lapsed
into sullen taciturnity when he learned I was an outsider. As he brooded there silently I could
not help feeling a quality of strangeness in him; some subtle alienage that could hardly be
analyzed. I was quite certain, for one thing, that he was tolerating me because of the storm
rather than welcoming me with genuine hospitality.
As for the storm, it seemed almost to have spent itself. Outside, it was already
growing lighter—for there was a full moon behind the clouds—and the rain had dwindled
to a trivial drizzle. Perhaps, I thought, I could now resume my journey after all; an idea which
I suggested to my host.
“Better wait till morning,” he remarked. “You say you’re
afoot, and it’s a good three hours to Glendale. I’ve two bedrooms upstairs, and you’re
welcome to one of them if you care to stay.”
There was a sincerity in his invitation which dispelled any doubts I had held
regarding his hospitality, and I now concluded that his silences must be the result of long
isolation from his fellows in this wilderness. After sitting without a word through three fillings
of my pipe, I finally began to yawn.
“It’s been rather a strenuous day for me,” I admitted, “and
I guess I’d better be making tracks for bed. I want to be up at sunrise, you know, and
on my way.”
My host waved his arm toward the door, through which I could see the hall and
the staircase.
“Take the lamp with you,” he instructed. “It’s the only
one I have, but I don’t mind sitting in the dark, really. Half the time I don’t light
it at all when I’m alone. Oil is so hard to get out here, and I go to the village so seldom.
Your room is the one on the right, at the head of the stairs.”
Taking the lamp and turning in the hall to say good-night, I could see his
eyes glowing almost phosphorescently in the darkened room I had left; and I was half reminded
for a moment of the jungle, and the circles of eyes that sometimes glow just beyond the radius
of the campfire. Then I started upstairs.
As I reached the second floor I could hear my host limping across the hall
to the other room below, and perceived that he moved with owlish sureness despite the darkness.
Truly, he had but little need of the lamp. The storm was over, and as I entered the room assigned
me I found it bright with the rays of a full moon that streamed on the bed from an uncurtained
south window. Blowing out the lamp and leaving the house in darkness but for the moonbeams,
I sniffed at the pungent odor that rose above the scent of the kerosene—the quasi-animal
odor I had noticed on first entering the place. I crossed to the window and threw it wide, breathing
deep of the cool, fresh night air.
When I started to undress I paused almost instantly, recalling my money belt,
still in its place about my waist. Possibly, I reflected, it would be well not to be too hasty
or unguarded; for I had read of men who seized just such an opportunity to rob and even to murder
the stranger within their dwelling. So, arranging the bedclothes to look as if they covered
a sleeping figure, I drew the room’s only chair into the concealing shadows, filled and
lighted my pipe again, and sat down to rest or watch, as the occasion might demand.
III.

I could not have been sitting there long when my sensitive ears caught the
sound of footsteps ascending the stairs. All the old lore of robber landlords rushed on me afresh,
when another moment revealed that the steps were plain, loud, and careless, with no attempt
at concealment; while my host’s tread, as I had heard it from the head of the staircase,
was a soft limping stride. Shaking the ashes from my pipe, I slipped it in my pocket. Then,
seizing and drawing my automatic, I rose from the chair, tiptoed across the room, and crouched
tensely in a spot which the opening door would cover.
The door opened, and into the shaft of moonlight stepped a man I had never
seen before. Tall, broad-shouldered, and distinguished, his face half hidden by a heavy square-cut
beard and his neck buried in a high black stock of a pattern long obsolete in America, he was
indubitably a foreigner. How he could have entered the house without my knowledge was quite
beyond me, nor could I believe for an instant that he had been concealed in either of the two
rooms or the hall below me. As I gazed intently at him in the insidious moonbeams it seemed
to me that I could see directly through his sturdy form; but perhaps this was only an illusion
that came from my shock of surprise.
Noticing the disarray of the bed, but evidently missing the intended effect
of occupancy, the stranger muttered something to himself in a foreign tongue and proceeded to
disrobe. Flinging his clothes into the chair I had vacated, he crept into bed, pulled the covers
over him, and in a moment or two was breathing with the regular respiration of a sound sleeper.
My first thought was to seek out my host and demand an explanation, but a second
later I deemed it better to make sure that the whole incident was not a mere delusive after-effect
of my wine-drugged sleep in the woods. I still felt weak and faint, and despite my recent supper
was as hungry as if I had not eaten since that noonday lunch.
I crossed to the bed, reached out, and grasped at the shoulder of the sleeping
man. Then, barely checking a cry of mad fright and dizzy astonishment, I fell back with pounding
pulse and dilated eyes. For my clutching fingers had passed directly through the sleeping
form, and seized only the sheet below!
A complete analysis of my jarred and jumbled sensations would be futile. The
man was intangible, yet I could still see him there, hear his regular breathing, and watch his
figure as it half turned beneath the clothes. And then, as I was quite certain of my own madness
or hypnosis, I heard other footsteps on the stairs; soft, padded, doglike, limping footsteps,
pattering up, up, up. . . . And again that pungent animal smell, this time in
redoubled volume. Dazed and dream-drowsed, I crept once more behind the protecting opened door,
shaken to the marrow, but now resigned to any fate known or nameless.
Then into that shaft of eerie moonlight stepped the gaunt form of a great gray
wolf. Limped, I should have said, for one hind foot was held in the air, as though wounded by
some stray shot. The beast turned its head in my direction, and as it did so the pistol dropped
from my twitching fingers and clattered unheeded to the floor. The ascending succession of horrors
was fast paralyzing my will and consciousness, for the eyes that now glared toward me from
that hellish head were the gray phosphorescent eyes of my host as they had peered at me through
the darkness of the kitchen.
I do not yet know whether it saw me. The eyes turned from my direction to the
bed, and gazed gluttonously on the spectral sleeping form there. Then the head tilted back,
and from that demon throat came the most shocking ululation I have ever heard; a thick, nauseous,
lupine howl that made my heart stand still. The form on the bed stirred, opened his eyes, and
shrank from what he saw. The animal crouched quivering, and then—as the ethereal figure
uttered a shriek of mortal human anguish and terror that no ghost of legend could counterfeit—sprang
straight for its victim’s throat, its white, firm, even teeth flashing in the moonlight
as they closed on the jugular vein of the screaming phantasm. The scream ended in a blood-choked
gurgle, and the frightened human eyes turned glassy.
That scream had roused me to action, and in a second I had retrieved my automatic
and emptied its entire contents into the wolfish monstrosity before me. But I heard the unhindered
thud of each bullet as it imbedded itself in the opposite wall.
My nerves gave way. Blind fear hurled me toward the door, and blind fear prompted
the one backward glance in which I saw that the wolf had sunk its teeth into the body of its
quarry. Then came that culminating sensory impression and the devastating thought to which it
gave birth. This was the same body I had thrust my hand through a few moments before . . .
and yet as I plunged down that black nightmare staircase I could hear the crunching of bones.
IV.

How I found the trail to Glendale, or how I managed to traverse it, I suppose
I shall never know. I only know that sunrise found me on the hill at the edge of the woods,
with the steepled village outspread below me, and the blue thread of the Cataqua sparkling in
the distance. Hatless, coatless, ashen-faced, and as soaked with perspiration as if I had spent
the night abroad in the storm, I hesitated to enter the village till I had recovered at least
some outward semblance of composure. At last I picked my way down hill and through the narrow
streets with their flagstone sidewalks and Colonial doorways till I reached the Lafayette House,
whose proprietor eyed me askance.
“Where from so early, son? And why the wild look?”
“I’ve just come through the woods from Mayfair.”
“You—came—through—the Devil’s Woods—last night—and—alone?”
The old man stared with a queer look of alternate horror and incredulity.
“Why not?” I countered. “I couldn’t have made it in time
through Potowisset, and I had to be here not later than this noon.”
“And last night was full moon! . . . My Gawd!” He
eyed me curiously. “See anything of Vasili Oukranikov or the Count?”
“Say, do I look that simple? What are you trying to do—jolly me?”
But his tone was as grave as a priest’s as he replied. “You must
be new to these parts, sonny. If you weren’t you’d know all about Devil’s Woods
and the full moon and Vasili and the rest.”
I felt anything but flippant, yet knew I must not seem serious after my earlier
remarks. “Go on—I know you’re dying to tell me. I’m like a donkey—all
ears.”
Then he told the legend in his dry way, stripping it of vitality and convincingness
through lack of coloring, detail, and atmosphere. But for me it needed no vitality or convincingness
that any poet could have given. Remember what I had witnessed, and remember that I had never
heard of the tale until after I had had the experience and fled from the terror of those
crunched phantom bones.
“There used to be quite a few Russians scattered betwixt here and Mayfair—they
came after one of their nihilist troubles back in Russia. Vasili Oukranikov was one of ’em—a
tall, thin, handsome chap with shiny yellow hair and a wonderful manner. They said, though,
that he was a servant of the devil—a werewolf and eater of men.
“He built him a house in the woods about a third of the way from here
to Mayfair and lived all alone. Every once in a while a traveler would come out of the woods
with some pretty strange tale about being chased by a big wolf with shining human eyes—like
Oukranikov’s. One night somebody took a pot shot at the wolf, and the next time the Russian
came into Glendale he walked with a limp. That settled it. There wasn’t any mere suspicion
now, but hard facts.
“Then he sent to Mayfair for the Count—his name was Feodor Tchernevsky
and he had bought the old gambrel-roofed Fowler place up State Street—to come out and see
him. They all warned the Count, for he was a fine man and a splendid neighbor, but he said he
could take care of himself all right. It was the night of the full moon. He was brave as they
make ’em, and all he did was to tell some men he had around the place to follow him to
Vasili’s if he didn’t show up in decent time. They did—and you tell me, sonny,
that you’ve been through those woods at night?”
“Sure I tell you”—I tried to appear nonchalant—“I’m
no Count, and here I am to tell the tale! . . . But what did the men find at Oukranikov’s
house?”
“They found the Count’s mangled body, sonny, and a gaunt gray wolf
hovering over it with blood-slavering jaws. You can guess who the wolf was. And folks do say
that at every full moon—but sonny, didn’t you see or hear anything?”
“Not a thing, pop! And say, what became of the wolf—or Vasili Oukranikov?”
“Why, son, they killed it—filled it full of lead and buried it in
the house, and then burned the place down—you know all this was sixty years ago when I
was a little shaver, but I remember it as if ’twas yesterday.”
I turned away with a shrug of my shoulders. It was all so quaint and silly
and artificial in the full light of day. But sometimes when I am alone after dark in waste places,
and hear the demon echoes of those screams and snarls, and that detestable crunching of bones,
I shudder again at the memory of that eldritch night.
",the ghosteater,HP Lovecraft
"In 1925 I went into Oklahoma looking for snake lore, and I came out with a fear of snakes that
will last me the rest of my life. I admit it is foolish, since there are natural explanations
for everything I saw and heard, but it masters me none the less. If the old story had been all
there was to it, I would not have been so badly shaken. My work as an American Indian ethnologist
has hardened me to all kinds of extravagant legendry, and I know that simple white people can
beat the redskins at their own game when it comes to fanciful inventions. But I can’t forget
what I saw with my own eyes at the insane asylum in Guthrie.
I called at that asylum because a few of the oldest settlers told me I would
find something important there. Neither Indians nor white men would discuss the snake-god legends
I had come to trace. The oil-boom newcomers, of course, knew nothing of such matters, and the
red men and old pioneers were plainly frightened when I spoke of them. Not more than six or
seven people mentioned the asylum, and those who did were careful to talk in whispers. But the
whisperers said that Dr. McNeill could shew me a very terrible relic and tell me all I wanted
to know. He could explain why Yig, the half-human father of serpents, is a shunned and feared
object in central Oklahoma, and why old settlers shiver at the secret Indian orgies which make
the autumn days and nights hideous with the ceaseless beating of tom-toms in lonely places.
It was with the scent of a hound on the trail that I went to Guthrie, for I
had spent many years collecting data on the evolution of serpent-worship among the Indians.
I had always felt, from well-defined undertones of legend and archaeology, that great Quetzalcoatl—benign
snake-god of the Mexicans—had had an older and darker prototype; and during recent months
I had well-nigh proved it in a series of researches stretching from Guatemala to the Oklahoma
plains. But everything was tantalising and incomplete, for above the border the cult of the
snake was hedged about by fear and furtiveness.
Now it appeared that a new and copious source of data was about to dawn, and
I sought the head of the asylum with an eagerness I did not try to cloak. Dr. McNeill was a
small, clean-shaven man of somewhat advanced years, and I saw at once from his speech and manner
that he was a scholar of no mean attainments in many branches outside his profession. Grave
and doubtful when I first made known my errand, his face grew thoughtful as he carefully scanned
my credentials and the letter of introduction which a kindly old ex-Indian agent had given
me.
“So you’ve been studying the Yig legend, eh?” he reflected sententiously.
“I know that many of our Oklahoma ethnologists have tried to connect it with Quetzalcoatl,
but I don’t think any of them have traced the intermediate steps so well. You’ve done
remarkable work for a man as young as you seem to be, and you certainly deserve all the data
we can give.
“I don’t suppose old Major Moore or any of the others told you what
it is I have here. They don’t like to talk about it, and neither do I. It is very tragic
and very horrible, but that is all. I refuse to consider it anything supernatural. There’s
a story about it that I’ll tell you after you see it—a devilish sad story, but one
that I won’t call magic. It merely shews the potency that belief has over some people.
I’ll admit there are times when I feel a shiver that’s more than physical, but in
daylight I set all that down to nerves. I’m not a young fellow any more, alas!
“To come to the point, the thing I have is what you might call a victim
of Yig’s curse—a physically living victim. We don’t let the bulk of the nurses
see it, although most of them know it’s here. There are just two steady old chaps whom
I let feed it and clean out its quarters—used to be three, but good old Stevens passed
on a few years ago. I suppose I’ll have to break in a new group pretty soon; for the thing
doesn’t seem to age or change much, and we old boys can’t last forever. Maybe the
ethics of the near future will let us give it a merciful release, but it’s hard to tell.
“Did you see that single ground-glass basement window over in the east
wing when you came up the drive? That’s where it is. I’ll take you there myself now.
You needn’t make any comment. Just look through the moveable panel in the door and thank
God the light isn’t any stronger. Then I’ll tell you the story—or as much as
I’ve been able to piece together.”
We walked downstairs very quietly, and did not talk as we threaded the corridors
of the seemingly deserted basement. Dr. McNeill unlocked a grey-painted steel door, but it was
only a bulkhead leading to a further stretch of hallway. At length he paused before a door marked
B 116, opened a small observation panel which he could use only by standing on tiptoe, and pounded
several times upon the painted metal, as if to arouse the occupant, whatever it might be.
A faint stench came from the aperture as the doctor unclosed it, and I fancied
his pounding elicited a kind of low, hissing response. Finally he motioned me to replace him
at the peep-hole, and I did so with a causeless and increasing tremor. The barred, ground-glass
window, close to the earth outside, admitted only a feeble and uncertain pallor; and I had to
look into the malodorous den for several seconds before I could see what was crawling and wriggling
about on the straw-covered floor, emitting every now and then a weak and vacuous hiss. Then
the shadowed outlines began to take shape, and I perceived that the squirming entity bore some
remote resemblance to a human form laid flat on its belly. I clutched at the door-handle for
support as I tried to keep from fainting.
The moving object was almost of human size, and entirely devoid of clothing.
It was absolutely hairless, and its tawny-looking back seemed subtly squamous in the dim, ghoulish
light. Around the shoulders it was rather speckled and brownish, and the head was very curiously
flat. As it looked up to hiss at me I saw that the beady little black eyes were damnably anthropoid,
but I could not bear to study them long. They fastened themselves on me with a horrible persistence,
so that I closed the panel gaspingly and left the creature to wriggle about unseen in its matted
straw and spectral twilight. I must have reeled a bit, for I saw that the doctor was gently
holding my arm as he guided me away. I was stuttering over and over again: “B-but for God’s
sake, what is it?”
Dr. McNeill told me the story in his private office as I sprawled opposite
him in an easy-chair. The gold and crimson of late afternoon changed to the violet of early
dusk, but still I sat awed and motionless. I resented every ring of the telephone and every
whir of the buzzer, and I could have cursed the nurses and internes whose knocks now and then
summoned the doctor briefly to the outer office. Night came, and I was glad my host switched
on all the lights. Scientist though I was, my zeal for research was half forgotten amidst such
breathless ecstasies of fright as a small boy might feel when whispered witch-tales go the rounds
of the chimney-corner.
It seems that Yig, the snake-god of the central plains tribes—presumably
the primal source of the more southerly Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan—was an odd, half-anthropomorphic
devil of highly arbitrary and capricious nature. He was not wholly evil, and was usually quite
well-disposed toward those who gave proper respect to him and his children, the serpents; but
in the autumn he became abnormally ravenous, and had to be driven away by means of suitable
rites. That was why the tom-toms in the Pawnee, Wichita, and Caddo country pounded ceaselessly
week in and week out in August, September, and October; and why the medicine-men made strange
noises with rattles and whistles curiously like those of the Aztecs and Mayas.
Yig’s chief trait was a relentless devotion to his children—a devotion
so great that the redskins almost feared to protect themselves from the venomous rattlesnakes
which thronged the region. Frightful clandestine tales hinted of his vengeance upon mortals
who flouted him or wreaked harm upon his wriggling progeny; his chosen method being to turn
his victim, after suitable tortures, to a spotted snake.
In the old days of the Indian Territory, the doctor went on, there was not
quite so much secrecy about Yig. The plains tribes, less cautious than the desert nomads and
Pueblos, talked quite freely of their legends and autumn ceremonies with the first Indian agents,
and let considerable of the lore spread out through the neighbouring regions of white settlement.
The great fear came in the land-rush days of ’89, when some extraordinary incidents had
been rumoured, and the rumours sustained, by what seemed to be hideously tangible proofs. Indians
said that the new white men did not know how to get on with Yig, and afterward the settlers
came to take that theory at face value. Now no old-timer in middle Oklahoma, white or red, could
be induced to breathe a word about the snake-god except in vague hints. Yet after all, the doctor
added with almost needless emphasis, the only truly authenticated horror had been a thing of
pitiful tragedy rather than of bewitchment. It was all very material and cruel—even that
last phase which had caused so much dispute.
Dr. McNeill paused and cleared his throat before getting down to his special
story, and I felt a tingling sensation as when a theatre curtain rises. The thing had begun
when Walker Davis and his wife Audrey left Arkansas to settle in the newly opened public lands
in the spring of 1889, and the end had come in the country of the Wichitas—north of the
Wichita River, in what is at present Caddo County. There is a small village called Binger there
now, and the railway goes through; but otherwise the place is less changed than other parts
of Oklahoma. It is still a section of farms and ranches—quite productive in these days—since
the great oil-fields do not come very close.
Walker and Audrey had come from Franklin County in the Ozarks with a canvas-topped
wagon, two mules, an ancient and useless dog called “Wolf”, and all their household
goods. They were typical hill-folk, youngish and perhaps a little more ambitious than most,
and looked forward to a life of better returns for their hard work than they had had in Arkansas.
Both were lean, raw-boned specimens; the man tall, sandy, and grey-eyed, and the woman short
and rather dark, with a black straightness of hair suggesting a slight Indian admixture.
In general, there was very little of distinction about them, and but for one
thing their annals might not have differed from those of thousands of other pioneers who flocked
into the new country at that time. That thing was Walker’s almost epileptic fear of snakes,
which some laid to prenatal causes, and some said came from a dark prophecy about his end with
which an old Indian squaw had tried to scare him when he was small. Whatever the cause, the
effect was marked indeed; for despite his strong general courage the very mention of a snake
would cause him to grow faint and pale, while the sight of even a tiny specimen would produce
a shock sometimes bordering on a convulsion seizure.
The Davises started out early in the year, in the hope of being on their new
land for the spring ploughing. Travel was slow; for the roads were bad in Arkansas, while in
the Territory there were great stretches of rolling hills and red, sandy barrens without any
roads whatever. As the terrain grew flatter, the change from their native mountains depressed
them more, perhaps, than they realised; but they found the people at the Indian agencies very
affable, while most of the settled Indians seemed friendly and civil. Now and then they encountered
a fellow-pioneer, with whom crude pleasantries and expressions of amiable rivalry were generally
exchanged.
Owing to the season, there were not many snakes in evidence, so Walker did
not suffer from his special temperamental weakness. In the earlier stages of the journey, too,
there were no Indian snake-legends to trouble him; for the transplanted tribes from the southeast
do not share the wilder beliefs of their western neighbours. As fate would have it, it was a
white man at Okmulgee in the Creek country who gave the Davises the first hint of Yig beliefs;
a hint which had a curiously fascinating effect on Walker, and caused him to ask questions very
freely after that.
Before long Walker’s fascination had developed into a bad case of fright.
He took the most extraordinary precautions at each of the nightly camps, always clearing away
whatever vegetation he found, and avoiding stony places whenever he could. Every clump of stunted
bushes and every cleft in the great, slab-like rocks seemed to him now to hide malevolent serpents,
while every human figure not obviously part of a settlement or emigrant train seemed to him
a potential snake-god till nearness had proved the contrary. Fortunately no troublesome encounters
came at this stage to shake his nerves still further.
As they approached the Kickapoo country they found it harder and harder to
avoid camping near rocks. Finally it was no longer possible, and poor Walker was reduced to
the puerile expedient of droning some of the rustic anti-snake charms he had learned in his
boyhood. Two or three times a snake was really glimpsed, and these sights did not help the sufferer
in his efforts to preserve composure.
On the twenty-second evening of the journey a savage wind made it imperative,
for the sake of the mules, to camp in as sheltered a spot as possible; and Audrey persuaded
her husband to take advantage of a cliff which rose uncommonly high above the dried bed of a
former tributary of the Canadian River. He did not like the rocky cast of the place, but allowed
himself to be overruled this once; leading the animals sullenly toward the protecting slope,
which the nature of the ground would not allow the wagon to approach.
Audrey, examining the rocks near the wagon, meanwhile noticed a singular sniffing
on the part of the feeble old dog. Seizing a rifle, she followed his lead, and presently thanked
her stars that she had forestalled Walker in her discovery. For there, snugly nested in the
gap between two boulders, was a sight it would have done him no good to see. Visible only as
one convoluted expanse, but perhaps comprising as many as three or four separate units, was
a mass of lazy wriggling which could not be other than a brood of new-born rattlesnakes.
Anxious to save Walker from a trying shock, Audrey did not hesitate to act,
but took the gun firmly by the barrel and brought the butt down again and again upon the writhing
objects. Her own sense of loathing was great, but it did not amount to a real fear. Finally
she saw that her task was done, and turned to cleanse the improvised bludgeon in the red sand
and dry, dead grass near by. She must, she reflected, cover the nest up before Walker got back
from tethering the mules. Old Wolf, tottering relic of mixed shepherd and coyote ancestry that
he was, had vanished, and she feared he had gone to fetch his master.
Footsteps at that instant proved her fear well founded. A second more, and
Walker had seen everything. Audrey made a move to catch him if he should faint, but he did no
more than sway. Then the look of pure fright on his bloodless face turned slowly to something
like mingled awe and anger, and he began to upbraid his wife in trembling tones.
“Gawd’s sake, Aud, but why’d ye go for to do that? Hain’t
ye heerd all the things they’ve been tellin’ about this snake-devil Yig? Ye’d
ought to a told me, and we’d a moved on. Don’t ye know they’s a devil-god what
gets even if ye hurts his children? What for d’ye think the Injuns all dances and beats
their drums in the fall about? This land’s under a curse, I tell ye—nigh every soul
we’ve a-talked to sence we come in’s said the same. Yig rules here, an’ he comes
out every fall for to git his victims and turn ’em into snakes. Why, Aud, they won’t
none of them Injuns acrost the Canayjin kill a snake for love nor money!
“Gawd knows what ye done to yourself, gal, a-stompin’ out a hull
brood o’ Yig’s chillen. He’ll git ye, sure, sooner or later, unlessen I kin buy
a charm offen some o’ the Injun medicine-men. He’ll git ye, Aud, as sure’s they’s
a Gawd in heaven—he’ll come outa the night and turn ye into a crawlin’ spotted
snake!”
All the rest of the journey Walker kept up the frightened reproofs and prophecies.
They crossed the Canadian near Newcastle, and soon afterward met with the first of the real
plains Indians they had seen—a party of blanketed Wichitas, whose leader talked freely
under the spell of the whiskey offered him, and taught poor Walker a long-winded protective
charm against Yig in exchange for a quart bottle of the same inspiring fluid. By the end of
the week the chosen site in the Wichita country was reached, and the Davises made haste to trace
their boundaries and perform the spring ploughing before even beginning the construction of
a cabin.
The region was flat, drearily windy, and sparse of natural vegetation, but
promised great fertility under cultivation. Occasional outcroppings of granite diversified a
soil of decomposed red sandstone, and here and there a great flat rock would stretch along the
surface of the ground like a man-made floor. There seemed to be a very few snakes, or possible
dens for them; so Audrey at last persuaded Walker to build the one-room cabin over a vast, smooth
slab of exposed stone. With such a flooring and with a good-sized fireplace the wettest weather
might be defied—though it soon became evident that dampness was no salient quality of the
district. Logs were hauled in the wagon from the nearest belt of woods, many miles toward the
Wichita Mountains.
Walker built his wide-chimneyed cabin and crude barn with the aid of some of
the other settlers, though the nearest one was over a mile away. In turn, he helped his helpers
at similar house-raisings, so that many ties of friendship sprang up between the new neighbours.
There was no town worthy the name nearer than El Reno, on the railway thirty miles or more to
the northeast; and before many weeks had passed, the people of the section had become very cohesive
despite the wideness of their scattering. The Indians, a few of whom had begun to settle down
on ranches, were for the most part harmless, though somewhat quarrelsome when fired by the liquid
stimulation which found its way to them despite all government bans.
Of all the neighbours the Davises found Joe and Sally Compton, who likewise
hailed from Arkansas, the most helpful and congenial. Sally is still alive, known now as Grandma
Compton; and her son Clyde, then an infant in arms, has become one of the leading men of the
state. Sally and Audrey used to visit each other often, for their cabins were only two miles
apart; and in the long spring and summer afternoons they exchanged many a tale of old Arkansas
and many a rumour about the new country.
Sally was very sympathetic about Walker’s weakness regarding snakes, but
perhaps did more to aggravate than cure the parallel nervousness which Audrey was acquiring
through his incessant praying and prophesying about the curse of Yig. She was uncommonly full
of gruesome snake stories, and produced a direfully strong impression with her acknowledged
masterpiece—the tale of a man in Scott County who had been bitten by a whole horde of rattlers
at once, and had swelled so monstrously from poison that his body had finally burst with a pop.
Needless to say, Audrey did not repeat this anecdote to her husband, and she implored the Comptons
to beware of starting it on the rounds of the countryside. It is to Joe’s and Sally’s
credit that they heeded this plea with the utmost fidelity.
Walker did his corn-planting early, and in midsummer improved his time by harvesting
a fair crop of the native grass of the region. With the help of Joe Compton he dug a well which
gave a moderate supply of very good water, though he planned to sink an artesian later on. He
did not run into many serious snake scares, and made his land as inhospitable as possible for
wriggling visitors. Every now and then he rode over to the cluster of thatched, conical huts
which formed the main village of the Wichitas, and talked long with the old men and shamans
about the snake-god and how to nullify his wrath. Charms were always ready in exchange for whiskey,
but much of the information he got was far from reassuring.
Yig was a great god. He was bad medicine. He did not forget things. In the
autumn his children were hungry and wild, and Yig was hungry and wild, too. All the tribes made
medicine against Yig when the corn harvest came. They gave him some corn, and danced in proper
regalia to the sound of whistle, rattle, and drum. They kept the drums pounding to drive Yig
away, and called down the aid of Tiráwa, whose children men are, even as the snakes are
Yig’s children. It was bad that the squaw of Davis killed the children of Yig. Let Davis
say the charms many times when the corn harvest comes. Yig is Yig. Yig is a great god.
By the time the corn harvest did come, Walker had succeeded in getting his
wife into a deplorably jumpy state. His prayers and borrowed incantations came to be a nuisance;
and when the autumn rites of the Indians began, there was always a distant wind-borne pounding
of tom-toms to lend an added background of the sinister. It was maddening to have the muffled
clatter always stealing over the wide red plains. Why would it never stop? Day and night, week
on week, it was always going in exhaustless relays, as persistently as the red dusty winds that
carried it. Audrey loathed it more than her husband did, for he saw in it a compensating element
of protection. It was with this sense of a mighty, intangible bulwark against evil that he got
in his corn crop and prepared cabin and stable for the coming winter.
The autumn was abnormally warm, and except for their primitive cookery the
Davises found scant use for the stone fireplace Walker had built with such care. Something in
the unnaturalness of the hot dust-clouds preyed on the nerves of all the settlers, but most
of all on Audrey’s and Walker’s. The notions of a hovering snake-curse and the weird,
endless rhythm of the distant Indian drums formed a bad combination which any added element
of the bizarre went far to render utterly unendurable.
Notwithstanding this strain, several festive gatherings were held at one or
another of the cabins after the crops were reaped; keeping naively alive in modernity those
curious rites of the harvest-home which are as old as human agriculture itself. Lafayette Smith,
who came from southern Missouri and had a cabin about three miles east of Walker’s, was
a very passable fiddler; and his tunes did much to make the celebrants forget the monotonous
beating of the distant tom-toms. Then Hallowe’en drew near, and the settlers planned another
frolic—this time, had they but known it, of a lineage older than even agriculture; the
dread Witch-Sabbath of the primal pre-Aryans, kept alive through ages in the midnight blackness
of secret woods, and still hinting at vague terrors under its latter-day mask of comedy and
lightness. Hallowe’en was to fall on a Thursday, and the neighbours agreed to gather for
their first revel at the Davis cabin.
It was on that thirty-first of October that the warm spell broke. The morning
was grey and leaden, and by noon the incessant winds had changed from searingness to rawness.
People shivered all the more because they were not prepared for the chill, and Walker Davis’
old dog Wolf dragged himself wearily indoors to a place beside the hearth. But the distant drums
still thumped on, nor were the white citizenry less inclined to pursue their chosen rites. As
early as four in the afternoon the wagons began to arrive at Walker’s cabin; and in the
evening, after a memorable barbecue, Lafayette Smith’s fiddle inspired a very fair-sized
company to great feats of saltatory grotesqueness in the one good-sized but crowded room. The
younger folk indulged in the amiable inanities proper to the season, and now and then old Wolf
would howl with doleful and spine-tickling ominousness at some especially spectral strain from
Lafayette’s squeaky violin—a device he had never heard before. Mostly, though, this
battered veteran slept through the merriment; for he was past the age of active interests and
lived largely in his dreams. Tom and Jennie Rigby had brought their collie Zeke along, but the
canines did not fraternise. Zeke seemed strangely uneasy over something, and nosed around curiously
all the evening.
Audrey and Walker made a fine couple on the floor, and Grandma Compton still
likes to recall her impression of their dancing that night. Their worries seemed forgotten for
the nonce, and Walker was shaved and trimmed into a surprising degree of spruceness. By ten
o’clock all hands were healthily tired, and the guests began to depart family by family
with many handshakings and bluff assurances of what a fine time everybody had had. Tom and Jennie
thought Zeke’s eerie howls as he followed them to their wagon were marks of regret at having
to go home; though Audrey said it must be the far-away tom-toms which annoyed him, for the distant
thumping was surely ghastly enough after the merriment within.
The night was bitterly cold, and for the first time Walker put a great log
in the fireplace and banked it with ashes to keep it smouldering till morning. Old Wolf dragged
himself within the ruddy glow and lapsed into his customary coma. Audrey and Walker, too tired
to think of charms or curses, tumbled into the rough pine bed and were asleep before the cheap
alarm-clock on the mantel had ticked out three minutes. And from far away, the rhythmic pounding
of those hellish tom-toms still pulsed on the chill night-wind.
Dr. McNeill paused here and removed his glasses, as if a blurring of the objective
world might make the reminiscent vision clearer.
“You’ll soon appreciate,” he said, “that I had a great
deal of difficulty in piecing out all that happened after the guests left. There were times,
though—at first—when I was able to make a try at it.” After a moment of silence
he went on with the tale.
Audrey had terrible dreams of Yig, who appeared to her in the guise of Satan
as depicted in cheap engravings she had seen. It was, indeed, from an absolute ecstasy of nightmare
that she started suddenly awake to find Walker already conscious and sitting up in bed. He seemed
to be listening intently to something, and silenced her with a whisper when she began to ask
what had roused him.
“Hark, Aud!” he breathed. “Don’t ye hear somethin’
a-singin’ and buzzin’ and rustlin’? D’ye reckon it’s the fall crickets?”
Certainly, there was distinctly audible within the cabin such a sound as he
had described. Audrey tried to analyse it, and was impressed with some element at once horrible
and familiar, which hovered just outside the rim of her memory. And beyond it all, waking a
hideous thought, the monotonous beating of the distant tom-toms came incessantly across the
black plains on which a cloudy half-moon had set.
“Walker—s’pose it’s—the—the—curse o’
Yig?”
She could feel him tremble.
“No, gal, I don’t reckon he comes that away. He’s shapen like
a man, except ye look at him clost. That’s what Chief Grey Eagle says. This here’s
some varmints come in outen the cold—not crickets, I calc’late, but summat like ’em.
I’d orter git up and stomp ’em out afore they make much headway or git at the cupboard.”
He rose, felt for the lantern that hung within easy reach, and rattled the
tin match-box nailed to the wall beside it. Audrey sat up in bed and watched the flare of the
match grow into the steady glow of the lantern. Then, as their eyes began to take in the whole
of the room, the crude rafters shook with the frenzy of their simultaneous shriek. For the flat,
rocky floor, revealed in the new-born illumination, was one seething, brown-speckled mass of
wriggling rattlesnakes, slithering toward the fire, and even now turning their loathsome heads
to menace the fright-blasted lantern-bearer.
It was only for an instant that Audrey saw the things. The reptiles were of
every size, of uncountable numbers, and apparently of several varieties; and even as she looked,
two or three of them reared their heads as if to strike at Walker. She did not faint—it
was Walker’s crash to the floor that extinguished the lantern and plunged her into blackness.
He had not screamed a second time—fright had paralysed him, and he fell as if shot by
a silent arrow from no mortal’s bow. To Audrey the entire world seemed to whirl about fantastically,
mingling with the nightmare from which she had started.
Voluntary motion of any sort was impossible, for will and the sense of reality
had left her. She fell back inertly on her pillow, hoping that she would wake soon. No actual
sense of what had happened penetrated her mind for some time. Then, little by little, the suspicion
that she was really awake began to dawn on her; and she was convulsed with a mounting blend
of panic and grief which made her long to shriek out despite the inhibiting spell which kept
her mute.
Walker was gone, and she had not been able to help him. He had died of snakes,
just as the old witch-woman had predicted when he was a little boy. Poor Wolf had not been able
to help, either—probably he had not even awaked from his senile stupor. And now the crawling
things must be coming for her, writhing closer and closer every moment in the dark, perhaps
even now twining slipperily about the bedposts and oozing up over the coarse woollen blankets.
Unconsciously she crept under the clothes and trembled.
It must be the curse of Yig. He had sent his monstrous children on All-Hallows’
Night, and they had taken Walker first. Why was that—wasn’t he innocent enough? Why
not come straight for her—hadn’t she killed those little rattlers alone? Then she
thought of the curse’s form as told by the Indians. She wouldn’t be killed—just
turned to a spotted snake. Ugh! So she would be like those things she had glimpsed on the floor—those
things which Yig had sent to get her and enroll her among their number! She tried to mumble
a charm that Walker had taught her, but found she could not utter a single sound.
The noisy ticking of the alarm-clock sounded above the maddening beat of the
distant tom-toms. The snakes were taking a long time—did they mean to delay on purpose
to play on her nerves? Every now and then she thought she felt a steady, insidious pressure
on the bedclothes, but each time it turned out to be only the automatic twitchings of her overwrought
nerves. The clock ticked on in the dark, and a change came slowly over her thoughts.
Those snakes couldn’t have taken so long! They couldn’t be
Yig’s messengers after all, but just natural rattlers that were nested below the rock and
had been drawn there by the fire. They weren’t coming for her, perhaps—perhaps they
had sated themselves on poor Walker. Where were they now? Gone? Coiled by the fire? Still crawling
over the prone corpse of their victim? The clock ticked, and the distant drums throbbed on.
At the thought of her husband’s body lying there in the pitch blackness
a thrill of purely physical horror passed over Audrey. That story of Sally Compton’s about
the man back in Scott County! He, too, had been bitten by a whole bunch of rattlesnakes, and
what had happened to him? The poison had rotted the flesh and swelled the whole corpse, and
in the end the bloated thing had burst horribly—burst horribly with a detestable
popping noise. Was that what was happening to Walker down there on the rock floor? Instinctively
she felt she had begun to listen for something too terrible even to name to herself.
The clock ticked on, keeping a kind of mocking, sardonic time with the far-off
drumming that the night-wind brought. She wished it were a striking clock, so that she could
know how long this eldritch vigil must last. She cursed the toughness of fibre that kept her
from fainting, and wondered what sort of relief the dawn could bring, after all. Probably neighbours
would pass—no doubt somebody would call—would they find her still sane? Was she still
sane now?
Morbidly listening, Audrey all at once became aware of something which she
had to verify with every effort of her will before she could believe it; and which, once verified,
she did not know whether to welcome or dread. The distant beating of the Indian tom-toms
had ceased. They had always maddened her—but had not Walker regarded them as a bulwark
against nameless evil from outside the universe? What were some of those things he had repeated
to her in whispers after talking with Grey Eagle and the Wichita medicine-men?
She did not relish this new and sudden silence, after all! There was something
sinister about it. The loud-ticking clock seemed abnormal in its new loneliness. Capable at
last of conscious motion, she shook the covers from her face and looked into the darkness toward
the window. It must have cleared after the moon set, for she saw the square aperture distinctly
against the background of stars.
Then without warning came that shocking, unutterable sound—ugh!—that
dull, putrid pop of cleft skin and escaping poison in the dark. God!—Sally’s
story—that obscene stench, and this gnawing, clawing silence! It was too much. The bonds
of muteness snapped, and the black night waxed reverberant with Audrey’s screams of stark,
unbridled frenzy.
Consciousness did not pass away with the shock. How merciful if only it had!
Amidst the echoes of her shrieking Audrey still saw the star-sprinkled square of window ahead,
and heard the doom-boding ticking of that frightful clock. Did she hear another sound? Was that
square window still a perfect square? She was in no condition to weigh the evidence of her senses
or distinguish between fact and hallucination.
No—that window was not a perfect square. Something had encroached on
the lower edge. Nor was the ticking of the clock the only sound in the room. There was,
beyond dispute, a heavy breathing neither her own nor poor Wolf’s. Wolf slept very silently,
and his wakeful wheezing was unmistakable. Then Audrey saw against the stars the black, daemoniac
silhouette of something anthropoid—the undulant bulk of a gigantic head and shoulders fumbling
slowly toward her.
“Y’aaaah! Y’aaaah! Go away! Go away! Go away, snake-devil! Go
’way, Yig! I didn’t mean to kill ’em—I was feared he’d be scairt of
’em. Don’t, Yig, don’t! I didn’t go for to hurt yore chillen—don’t
come nigh me—don’t change me into no spotted snake!”
But the half-formless head and shoulders only lurched onward toward the bed,
very silently.
Everything snapped at once inside Audrey’s head, and in a second she had
turned from a cowering child to a raging madwoman. She knew where the axe was—hung against
the wall on those pegs near the lantern. It was within easy reach, and she could find it in
the dark. Before she was conscious of anything further it was in her hands, and she was creeping
toward the foot of the bed—toward the monstrous head and shoulders that every moment groped
their way nearer. Had there been any light, the look on her face would not have been pleasant
to see.
“Take that, you! And that, and that, and that!”
She was laughing shrilly now, and her cackles mounted higher as she saw that
the starlight beyond the window was yielding to the dim prophetic pallor of coming dawn.
Dr. McNeill wiped the perspiration from his forehead and put on his glasses
again. I waited for him to resume, and as he kept silent I spoke softly.
“She lived? She was found? Was it ever explained?”
The doctor cleared his throat.
“Yes—she lived, in a way. And it was explained. I told you there
was no bewitchment—only cruel, pitiful, material horror.”
It was Sally Compton who had made the discovery. She had ridden over to the
Davis cabin the next afternoon to talk over the party with Audrey, and had seen no smoke from
the chimney. That was queer. It had turned very warm again, yet Audrey was usually cooking something
at that hour. The mules were making hungry-sounding noises in the barn, and there was no sign
of old Wolf sunning himself in the accustomed spot by the door.
Altogether, Sally did not like the look of the place, so was very timid and
hesitant as she dismounted and knocked. She got no answer but waited some time before trying
the crude door of split logs. The lock, it appeared, was unfastened; and she slowly pushed her
way in. Then, perceiving what was there, she reeled back, gasped, and clung to the jamb to preserve
her balance.
A terrible odour had welled out as she opened the door, but that was not what
had stunned her. It was what she had seen. For within that shadowy cabin monstrous things had
happened and three shocking objects remained on the floor to awe and baffle the beholder.
Near the burned-out fireplace was the great dog—purple decay on the skin
left bare by mange and old age, and the whole carcass burst by the puffing effect of rattlesnake
poison. It must have been bitten by a veritable legion of the reptiles.
To the right of the door was the axe-hacked remnant of what had been a man—clad
in a nightshirt, and with the shattered bulk of a lantern clenched in one hand. He was totally
free from any sign of snake-bite. Near him lay the ensanguined axe, carelessly discarded.
And wriggling flat on the floor was a loathsome, vacant-eyed thing that had
been a woman, but was now only a mute mad caricature. All that this thing could do was to hiss,
and hiss, and hiss.
Both the doctor and I were brushing cold drops from our foreheads by this time.
He poured something from a flask on his desk, took a nip, and handed another glass to me. I
could only suggest tremulously and stupidly:
“So Walker had only fainted that first time—the screams roused him,
and the axe did the rest?”
“Yes.” Dr. McNeill’s voice was low. “But he met his death
from snakes just the same. It was his fear working in two ways—it made him faint, and it
made him fill his wife with the wild stories that caused her to strike out when she thought
she saw the snake-devil.”
I thought for a moment.
“And Audrey—wasn’t it queer how the curse of Yig seemed to work
itself out on her? I suppose the impression of hissing snakes had been fairly ground into her.”
“Yes. There were lucid spells at first, but they got to be fewer and fewer.
Her hair came white at the roots as it grew, and later began to fall out. The skin grew blotchy,
and when she died—”
I interrupted with a start.
“Died? Then what was that—that thing downstairs?”
McNeill spoke gravely.
“That is what was born to her three-quarters of a year afterward.
There were three more of them—two were even worse—but this is the only one that lived.”",the curse of yig,HP Lovecraft

It is only within the last few years that most people have stopped thinking of the West as a
new land. I suppose the idea gained ground because our own especial civilisation happens
to be new there; but nowadays explorers are digging beneath the surface and bringing up whole
chapters of life that rose and fell among these plains and mountains before recorded history
began. We think nothing of a Pueblo village 2500 years old, and it hardly jolts us when archaeologists
put the sub-pedregal culture of Mexico back to 17,000 or 18,000 B. C. We hear rumours of still
older things, too—of primitive man contemporaneous with extinct animals and known today
only through a few fragmentary bones and artifacts—so that the idea of newness is fading out
pretty rapidly. Europeans usually catch the sense of immemorial ancientness and deep deposits
from successive life-streams better than we do. Only a couple of years ago a British author
spoke of Arizona as a “moon-dim region, very lovely in its way, and stark and old—an
ancient, lonely land”.
Yet I believe I have a deeper sense of the stupefying—almost horrible—ancientness
of the West than any European. It all comes from an incident that happened in 1928; an incident
which I’d greatly like to dismiss as three-quarters hallucination, but which has left
such a frightfully firm impression on my memory that I can’t put it off very easily. It
was in Oklahoma, where my work as an American Indian ethnologist constantly takes me and where
I had come upon some devilishly strange and disconcerting matters before. Make no mistake—Oklahoma
is a lot more than a mere pioneers’ and promoters’ frontier. There are old, old
tribes with old, old memories there; and when the tom-toms beat ceaselessly over brooding plains
in the autumn the spirits of men are brought dangerously close to primal, whispered things.
I am white and Eastern enough myself, but anybody is welcome to know that the rites of Yig,
Father of Snakes, can get a real shudder out of me any day. I have heard and seen too much to
be “sophisticated” in such matters. And so it is with this incident of 1928. I’d
like to laugh it off—but I can’t.
I had gone into Oklahoma to track down and correlate one of the many ghost
tales which were current among the white settlers, but which had strong Indian corroboration,
and—I felt sure—an ultimate Indian source. They were very curious, these open-air
ghost tales; and though they sounded flat and prosaic in the mouths of the white people, they
had earmarks of linkage with some of the richest and obscurest phases of native mythology. All
of them were woven around the vast, lonely, artificial-looking mounds in the western part of
the state, and all of them involved apparitions of exceedingly strange aspect and equipment.
The commonest, and among the oldest, became quite famous in 1892, when a government
marshal named John Willis went into the mound region after horse-thieves and came out with a
wild yarn of nocturnal cavalry horses in the air between great armies of invisible spectres—battles
that involved the rush of hooves and feet, the thud of blows, the clank of metal on metal, the
muffled cries of warriors, and the fall of human and equine bodies. These things happened by
moonlight, and frightened his horse as well as himself. The sounds persisted an hour at a time;
vivid, but subdued as if brought from a distance by a wind, and unaccompanied by any glimpse
of the armies themselves. Later on Willis learned that the seat of the sounds was a notoriously
haunted spot, shunned by settlers and Indians alike. Many had seen, or half seen, the warring
horsemen in the sky, and had furnished dim, ambiguous descriptions. The settlers described the
ghostly fighters as Indians, though of no familiar tribe, and having the most singular costumes
and weapons. They even went so far as to say that they could not be sure the horses were really
horses.
The Indians, on the other hand, did not seem to claim the spectres as kinsfolk.
They referred to them as “those people”, “the old people”, or “they
who dwell below”, and appeared to hold them in too great a frightened veneration to talk
much about them. No ethnologist had been able to pin any tale-teller down to a specific description
of the beings, and apparently nobody had ever had a very clear look at them. The Indians had
one or two old proverbs about these phenomena, saying that “men very old, make very big
spirit; not so old, not so big; older than all time, then spirit he so big he near flesh; those
old people and spirits they mix up—get all the same”.
Now all of this, of course, is “old stuff” to an ethnologist—of
a piece with the persistent legends of rich hidden cities and buried races which abound among
the Pueblo and plains Indians, and which lured Coronado centuries ago on his vain search for
the fabled Quivira. What took me into western Oklahoma was something far more definite and tangible—a
local and distinctive tale which, though really old, was wholly new to the outside world of
research, and which involved the first clear descriptions of the ghosts which it treated of.
There was an added thrill in the fact that it came from the remote town of Binger, in Caddo
County, a place I had long known as the scene of a very terrible and partly inexplicable occurrence
connected with the snake-god myth.
The tale, outwardly, was an extremely naive and simple one, and centred in
a huge, lone mound or small hill that rose above the plain about a third of a mile west of the
village—a mound which some thought a product of Nature, but which others believed to be
a burial-place or ceremonial dais constructed by prehistoric tribes. This mound, the villagers
said, was constantly haunted by two Indian figures which appeared in alternation; an old man
who paced back and forth along the top from dawn till dusk, regardless of the weather and with
only brief intervals of disappearance, and a squaw who took his place at night with a blue-flamed
torch that glimmered quite continuously till morning. When the moon was bright the squaw’s
peculiar figure could be seen fairly plainly, and over half the villagers agreed that the apparition
was headless.
Local opinion was divided as to the motives and relative ghostliness of the
two visions. Some held that the man was not a ghost at all, but a living Indian who had killed
and beheaded a squaw for gold and buried her somewhere on the mound. According to these theorists
he was pacing the eminence through sheer remorse, bound by the spirit of his victim which took
visible shape after dark. But other theorists, more uniform in their spectral beliefs, held
that both man and woman were ghosts; the man having killed the squaw and himself as well at
some very distant period. These and minor variant versions seemed to have been current ever
since the settlement of the Wichita country in 1889, and were, I was told, sustained to an astonishing
degree by still-existing phenomena which anyone might observe for himself. Not many ghost tales
offer such free and open proof, and I was very eager to see what bizarre wonders might be lurking
in this small, obscure village so far from the beaten path of crowds and from the ruthless searchlight
of scientific knowledge. So, in the late summer of 1928 I took a train for Binger and brooded
on strange mysteries as the cars rattled timidly along their single track through a lonelier
and lonelier landscape.
Binger is a modest cluster of frame houses and stores in the midst of a flat
windy region full of clouds of red dust. There are about 500 inhabitants besides the Indians
on a neighbouring reservation; the principal occupation seeming to be agriculture. The soil
is decently fertile, and the oil boom has not reached this part of the state. My train drew
in at twilight, and I felt rather lost and uneasy—cut off from wholesome and every-day
things—as it puffed away to the southward without me. The station platform was filled
with curious loafers, all of whom seemed eager to direct me when I asked for the man to whom
I had letters of introduction. I was ushered along a commonplace main street whose rutted surface
was red with the sandstone soil of the country, and finally delivered at the door of my prospective
host. Those who had arranged things for me had done well; for Mr. Compton was a man of high
intelligence and local responsibility, while his mother—who lived with him and was familiarly
known as “Grandma Compton”—was one of the first pioneer generation, and a veritable
mine of anecdote and folklore.
That evening the Comptons summed up for me all the legends current among the
villagers, proving that the phenomenon I had come to study was indeed a baffling and important
one. The ghosts, it seems, were accepted almost as a matter of course by everyone in Binger.
Two generations had been born and grown up within sight of that queer, lone tumulus and its
restless figures. The neighbourhood of the mound was naturally feared and shunned, so that the
village and the farms had not spread toward it in all four decades of settlement; yet venturesome
individuals had several times visited it. Some had come back to report that they saw no ghosts
at all when they neared the dreaded hill; that somehow the lone sentinel had stepped out of
sight before they reached the spot, leaving them free to climb the steep slope and explore the
flat summit. There was nothing up there, they said—merely a rough expanse of underbrush.
Where the Indian watcher could have vanished to, they had no idea. He must, they reflected,
have descended the slope and somehow managed to escape unseen along the plain; although there
was no convenient cover within sight. At any rate, there did not appear to be any opening into
the mound; a conclusion which was reached after considerable exploration of the shrubbery and
tall grass on all sides. In a few cases some of the more sensitive searchers declared that they
felt a sort of invisible restraining presence; but they could describe nothing more definite
than that. It was simply as if the air thickened against them in the direction they wished to
move. It is needless to mention that all these daring surveys were conducted by day. Nothing
in the universe could have induced any human being, white or red, to approach that sinister
elevation after dark; and indeed, no Indian would have thought of going near it even in the
brightest sunlight.
But it was not from the tales of these sane, observant seekers that the chief
terror of the ghost-mound sprang; indeed, had their experience been typical, the phenomenon
would have bulked far less prominently in the local legendry. The most evil thing was the fact
that many other seekers had come back strangely impaired in mind and body, or had not come back
at all. The first of these cases had occurred in 1891, when a young man named Heaton had gone
with a shovel to see what hidden secrets he could unearth. He had heard curious tales from the
Indians, and had laughed at the barren report of another youth who had been out to the mound
and had found nothing. Heaton had watched the mound with a spy glass from the village while
the other youth made his trip; and as the explorer neared the spot, he saw the sentinel Indian
walk deliberately down into the tumulus as if a trap-door and staircase existed on the top.
The other youth had not noticed how the Indian disappeared, but had merely found him gone upon
arriving at the mound.
When Heaton made his own trip he resolved to get to the bottom of the mystery,
and watchers from the village saw him hacking diligently at the shrubbery atop the mound. Then
they saw his figure melt slowly into invisibility; not to reappear for long hours, till after
the dusk drew on, and the torch of the headless squaw glimmered ghoulishly on the distant elevation.
About two hours after nightfall he staggered into the village minus his spade and other belongings,
and burst into a shrieking monologue of disconnected ravings. He howled of shocking abysses
and monsters, of terrible carvings and statues, of inhuman captors and grotesque tortures, and
of other fantastic abnormalities too complex and chimerical even to remember. “Old! Old!
Old!” he would moan over and over again, “great God, they are older than the earth,
and came here from somewhere else—they know what you think, and make you know what they
think—they’re half-man, half-ghost—crossed the line—melt and take shape again—getting
more and more so, yet we’re all descended from them in the beginning—children of
Tulu—everything made of gold—monstrous animals, half-human—dead slaves—madness—Iä!
Shub-Niggurath!—that white man—oh, my God, what they did to him! . . .”
Heaton was the village idiot for about eight years, after which he died in
an epileptic fit. Since his ordeal there had been two more cases of mound-madness, and eight
of total disappearance. Immediately after Heaton’s mad return, three desperate and determined
men had gone out to the lone hill together; heavily armed, and with spades and pickaxes. Watching
villagers saw the Indian ghost melt away as the explorers drew near, and afterward saw the men
climb the mound and begin scouting around through the underbrush. All at once they faded into
nothingness, and were never seen again. One watcher, with an especially powerful telescope,
thought he saw other forms dimly materialise beside the hapless men and drag them down into
the mound; but this account remained uncorroborated. It is needless to say that no searching-party
went out after the lost ones, and that for many years the mound was wholly unvisited. Only when
the incidents of 1891 were largely forgotten did anybody dare to think of further explorations.
Then, about 1910, a fellow too young to recall the old horrors made a trip to the shunned spot
and found nothing at all.
By 1915 the acute dread and wild legendry of ’91 had largely faded into
the commonplace and unimaginative ghost-tales at present surviving—that is, had so faded
among the white people. On the nearby reservation were old Indians who thought much and kept
their own counsel. About this time a second wave of active curiosity and adventuring developed,
and several bold searchers made the trip to the mound and returned. Then came a trip of two
Eastern visitors with spades and other apparatus—a pair of amateur archaeologists connected
with a small college, who had been making studies among the Indians. No one watched this trip
from the village, but they never came back. The searching-party that went out after them—among
whom was my host Clyde Compton—found nothing whatsoever amiss at the mound.
The next trip was the solitary venture of old Capt. Lawton, a grizzled pioneer
who had helped to open up the region in 1889, but who had never been there since. He had recalled
the mound and its fascination all through the years; and being now in comfortable retirement,
resolved to have a try at solving the ancient riddle. Long familiarity with Indian myth had
given him ideas rather stranger than those of the simple villagers, and he had made preparations
for some extensive delving. He ascended the mound on the morning of Thursday, May 11, 1916,
watched through spy glasses by more than twenty people in the village and on the adjacent plain.
His disappearance was very sudden, and occurred as he was hacking at the shrubbery with a brush-cutter.
No one could say more than that he was there one moment and absent the next. For over a week
no tidings of him reached Binger, and then—in the middle of the night—there dragged
itself into the village the object about which dispute still rages.
It said it was—or had been—Capt. Lawton, but it was definitely younger
by as much as forty years than the old man who had climbed the mound. Its hair was jet black,
and its face—now distorted with nameless fright—free from wrinkles. But it did remind
Grandma Compton most uncannily of the captain as he had looked back in ’89. Its feet were
cut off neatly at the ankles, and the stumps were smoothly healed to an extent almost incredible
if the being really were the man who had walked upright a week before. It babbled of incomprehensible
things, and kept repeating the name “George Lawton, George E. Lawton” as if trying
to reassure itself of its own identity. The things it babbled of, Grandma Compton thought, were
curiously like the hallucinations of poor young Heaton in ’91; though there were minor
differences. “The blue light!—the blue light! . . .” muttered the
object, “always down there, before there were any living things—older than the dinosaurs—always
the same, only weaker—never death—brooding and brooding and brooding—the
same people, half-man and half-gas—the dead that walk and work—oh, those beasts,
those half-human unicorns—houses and cities of gold—old, old, old, older than time—came
down from the stars—Great Tulu—Azathoth—Nyarlathotep—waiting, waiting. . . .”
The object died before dawn.
Of course there was an investigation, and the Indians at the reservation were
grilled unmercifully. But they knew nothing, and had nothing to say. At least, none of them
had anything to say except old Grey Eagle, a Wichita chieftain whose more than a century of
age put him above common fears. He alone deigned to grunt some advice.
“You let um ’lone, white man. No good—those people. All under
here, all under there, them old ones. Yig, big father of snakes, he there. Yig is Yig. Tiráwa,
big father of men, he there. Tiráwa is Tiráwa. No die. No get old. Just same like
air. Just live and wait. One time they come out here, live and fight. Build um dirt tepee. Bring
up gold—they got plenty. Go off and make new lodges. Me them. You them. Then big waters
come. All change. Nobody come out, let nobody in. Get in, no get out. You let um ’lone,
you have no bad medicine. Red man know, he no get catch. White man meddle, he no come back.
Keep ’way little hills. No good. Grey Eagle say this.”
If Joe Norton and Rance Wheelock had taken the old chief’s advice, they would
probably be here today; but they didn’t. They were great readers and materialists, and
feared nothing in heaven or earth; and they thought that some Indian fiends had a secret headquarters
inside the mound. They had been to the mound before, and now they went again to avenge old Capt.
Lawton—boasting that they’d do it if they had to tear the mound down altogether. Clyde
Compton watched them with a pair of prism binoculars and saw them round the base of the sinister
hill. Evidently they meant to survey their territory very gradually and minutely. Minutes passed,
and they did not reappear. Nor were they ever seen again.
Once more the mound was a thing of panic fright, and only the excitement of
the Great War served to restore it to the farther background of Binger folklore. It was unvisited
from 1916 to 1919, and would have remained so but for the daredeviltry of some of the youths
back from service in France. From 1919 to 1920, however, there was a veritable epidemic of mound-visiting
among the prematurely hardened young veterans—an epidemic that waxed as one youth after
another returned unhurt and contemptuous. By 1920—so short is human memory—the mound
was almost a joke; and the tame story of the murdered squaw began to displace darker whispers
on everybody’s tongues. Then two reckless young brothers—the especially unimaginative
and hard-boiled Clay boys—decided to go and dig up the buried squaw and the gold for which
the old Indian had murdered her.
They went out on a September afternoon—about the time the Indian tom-toms
begin their incessant annual beating over the flat, red-dusty plains. Nobody watched them, and
their parents did not become worried at their non-return for several hours. Then came an alarm
and a searching-party, and another resignation to the mystery of silence and doubt.
But one of them came back after all. It was Ed, the elder, and his straw-coloured
hair and beard had turned an albino white for two inches from the roots. On his forehead was
a queer scar like a branded hieroglyph. Three months after he and his brother Walker had vanished
he skulked into his house at night, wearing nothing but a queerly patterned blanket which he
thrust into the fire as soon as he had got into a suit of his own clothes. He told his parents
that he and Walker had been captured by some strange Indians—not Wichitas or Caddos—and
held prisoners somewhere toward the west. Walker had died under torture, but he himself had
managed to escape at a high cost. The experience had been particularly terrible, and he could
not talk about it just then. He must rest—and anyway, it would do no good to give an alarm
and try to find and punish the Indians. They were not of a sort that could be caught or punished,
and it was especially important for the good of Binger—for the good of the world—that
they be not pursued into their secret lair. As a matter of fact, they were not altogether what
one could call real Indians—he would explain about that later. Meanwhile he must rest.
Better not to rouse the village with the news of his return—he would go upstairs and sleep.
Before he climbed the rickety flight to his room he took a pad and pencil from the living-room
table, and an automatic pistol from his father’s desk drawer.
Three hours later the shot rang out. Ed Clay had put a bullet neatly through
his temples with a pistol clutched in his left hand, leaving a sparsely written sheet of paper
on the rickety table near his bed. He had, it later appeared from the whittled pencil-stub and
stove full of charred paper, originally written much more; but had finally decided not to tell
what he knew beyond vague hints. The surviving fragment was only a mad warning scrawled in a
curiously backhanded script—the ravings of a mind obviously deranged by hardships—and
it read thus; rather surprisingly for the utterance of one who had always been stolid and matter-of-fact:

For gods sake never go nere that mound it is part of some kind of a world so
devilish and old it cannot be spoke about me and Walker went and was took into the thing just
melted at times and made up agen and the whole world outside is helpless alongside of what they
can do—they what live forever young as they like and you cant tell if they are really
men or just gostes—and what they do cant be spoke about and this is only 1 entrance—you
cant tell how big the whole thing is—after what we seen I dont want to live aney more
France was nothing besides this—and see that people always keep away o god they wood if
they see poor walker like he was in the end.
Yrs truely
Ed Clay

At the autopsy it was found that all of young Clay’s organs were transposed
from right to left within his body, as if he had been turned inside out. Whether they had always
been so, no one could say at the time, but it was later learned from army records that Ed had
been perfectly normal when mustered out of the service in May, 1919. Whether there was a mistake
somewhere, or whether some unprecedented metamorphosis had indeed occurred, is still an unsettled
question, as is also the origin of the hieroglyph-like scar on the forehead.
That was the end of the explorations of the mound. In the eight intervening
years no one had been near the place, and few indeed had even cared to level a spy glass at
it. From time to time people continued to glance nervously at the lone hill as it rose starkly
from the plain against the western sky, and to shudder at the small dark speck that paraded
by day and the glimmering will-o’-the-wisp that danced by night. The thing was accepted
at face value as a mystery not to be probed, and by common consent the village shunned the subject.
It was, after all, quite easy to avoid the hill; for space was unlimited in every direction,
and community life always follows beaten trails. The mound side of the village was simply kept
trailless, as if it had been water or swampland or desert. And it is a curious commentary on
the stolidity and imaginative sterility of the human animal that the whispers with which children
and strangers were warned away from the mound quickly sank once more into the flat tale of a
murderous Indian ghost and his squaw victim. Only the tribesmen on the reservation, and thoughtful
old-timers like Grandma Compton, remembered the overtones of unholy vistas and deep cosmic menace
which clustered around the ravings of those who had come back changed and shattered.
It was very late, and Grandma Compton had long since gone upstairs to bed,
when Clyde finished telling me this. I hardly knew what to think of the frightful puzzle, yet
rebelled at any notion to conflict with sane materialism. What influence had brought madness,
or the impulse of flight and wandering, to so many who had visited the mound? Though vastly
impressed, I was spurred on rather than deterred. Surely I must get to the bottom of this matter,
as well I might if I kept a cool head and an unbroken determination. Compton saw my mood and
shook his head worriedly. Then he motioned me to follow him outdoors.
We stepped from the frame house to the quiet side street or lane, and walked
a few paces in the light of a waning August moon to where the houses were thinner. The half-moon
was still low, and had not blotted many stars from the sky; so that I could see not only the
westering gleams of Altair and Vega, but the mystic shimmering of the Milky Way, as I looked
out over the vast expanse of earth and sky in the direction that Compton pointed. Then all at
once I saw a spark that was not a star—a bluish spark that moved and glimmered against
the Milky Way near the horizon, and that seemed in a vague way more evil and malevolent than
anything in the vault above. In another moment it was clear that this spark came from the top
of a long distant rise in the outspread and faintly litten plain; and I turned to Compton with
a question.
“Yes,” he answered, “it’s the blue ghost-light—and
that is the mound. There’s not a night in history that we haven’t seen it—and
not a living soul in Binger that would walk out over that plain toward it. It’s a bad
business, young man, and if you’re wise you’ll let it rest where it is. Better call
your search off, son, and tackle some of the other Injun legends around here. We’ve plenty
to keep you busy, heaven knows!”
II.

But I was in no mood for advice; and though Compton gave me a pleasant room,
I could not sleep a wink through eagerness for the next morning with its chances to see the
daytime ghost and to question the Indians at the reservation. I meant to go about the whole
thing slowly and thoroughly, equipping myself with all available data both white and red before
I commenced any actual archaeological investigations. I rose and dressed at dawn, and when I
heard others stirring I went downstairs. Compton was building the kitchen fire while his mother
was busy in the pantry. When he saw me he nodded, and after a moment invited me out into the
glamorous young sunlight. I knew where we were going, and as we walked along the lane I strained
my eyes westward over the plains.
There was the mound—far away and very curious in its aspect of artificial
regularity. It must have been from thirty to forty feet high, and all of a hundred yards from
north to south as I looked at it. It was not as wide as that from east to west, Compton said,
but had the contour of a rather thinnish ellipse. He, I knew, had been safely out to it and
back several times. As I looked at the rim silhouetted against the deep blue of the west I tried
to follow its minor irregularities, and became impressed with a sense of something moving upon
it. My pulse mounted a bit feverishly, and I seized quickly on the high-powered binoculars which
Compton had quietly offered me. Focussing them hastily, I saw at first only a tangle of underbrush
on the distant mound’s rim—and then something stalked into the field.
It was unmistakably a human shape, and I knew at once that I was seeing the
daytime “Indian ghost” I did not wonder at the description, for surely the tall,
lean, darkly robed being with the filleted black hair and seamed, coppery, expressionless, aquiline
face looked more like an Indian than anything else in my previous experience. And yet my trained
ethnologist’s eye told me at once that this was no redskin of any sort hitherto known
to history, but a creature of vast racial variation and of a wholly different culture-stream.
Modern Indians are brachycephalic—round-headed—and you can’t find any dolichocephalic
or long-headed skulls except in ancient Pueblo deposits dating back 2500 years or more; yet
this man’s long-headedness was so pronounced that I recognised it at once, even at his vast distance
and in the uncertain field of the binoculars. I saw, too, that the pattern of his robe represented
a decorative tradition utterly remote from anything we recognise in southwestern native art.
There were shining metal trappings, likewise, and a short sword or kindred weapon at his side,
all wrought in a fashion wholly alien to anything I had ever heard of.
As he paced back and forth along the top of the mound I followed him for several
minutes with the glass, noting the kinaesthetic quality of his stride and the poised way he
carried his head; and there was borne in upon me the strong, persistent conviction that this
man, whoever or whatever he might be, was certainly not a savage. He was the product
of a civilisation, I felt instinctively, though of what civilisation I could not guess.
At length he disappeared beyond the farther edge of the mound, as if descending the opposite
and unseen slope; and I lowered the glass with a curious mixture of puzzled feelings. Compton
was looking quizzically at me, and I nodded non-committally, “What do you make of that?”
he ventured. “This is what we’ve seen here in Binger every day of our lives.”
That noon found me at the Indian reservation talking with old Grey Eagle—who,
through some miracle, was still alive; though he must have been close to a hundred and fifty
years old. He was a strange, impressive figure—this stern, fearless leader of his kind
who had talked with outlaws and traders in fringed buckskin and French officials in knee-breeches
and three-cornered hats—and I was glad to see that, because of my air of deference toward
him, he appeared to like me. His liking, however, took an unfortunately obstructive form as
soon as he learned what I wanted; for all he would do was to warn me against the search I was
about to make.
“You good boy—you no bother that hill. Bad medicine. Plenty devil
under there—catchum when you dig. No dig, no hurt. Go and dig, no come back. Just same
when me boy, just same when my father and he father boy. All time buck he walk in day, squaw
with no head she walk in night. All time since white man with tin coats they come from sunset
and below big river—long way back—three, four times more back than Grey Eagle—two
times more back than Frenchmen—all same after then. More back than that, nobody go near
little hills nor deep valleys with stone caves. Still more back, those old ones no hide, come
out and make villages. Bring plenty gold. Me them. You them. Then big waters come. All change.
Nobody come out, let nobody in. Get in, no get out. They no die—no get old like Grey Eagle
with valleys in face and snow on head. Just same like air—some man, some spirit. Bad medicine.
Sometimes at night spirit come out on half-man–half-horse-with-horn and fight where men once
fight. Keep ’way them place. No good. You good boy—go ’way and let them old
ones ’lone.”
That was all I could get out of the ancient chief, and the rest of the Indians
would say nothing at all. But if I was troubled, Grey Eagle was clearly more so; for he obviously
felt a real regret at the thought of my invading the region he feared so abjectly. As I turned
to leave the reservation he stopped me for a final ceremonial farewell, and once more tried
to get my promise to abandon my search. When he saw that he could not, he produced something
half-timidly from a buckskin pouch he wore, and extended it toward me very solemnly. It was
a worn but finely minted metal disc about two inches in diameter, oddly figured and perforated,
and suspended from a leathern cord.
“You no promise, then Grey Eagle no can tell what get you. But if anything
help um, this good medicine. Come from my father—he get from he father—he get from
he father—all way back, close to Tiráwa, all men’s father. My father say,
‘You keep ’way from those old ones, keep ’way from little hills and valleys
with stone caves. But if old ones they come out to get you, then you shew um this medicine.
They know. They make him long way back. They look, then they no do such bad medicine maybe.
But no can tell. You keep ’way, just same. Them no good. No tell what they do.’”
As he spoke, Grey Eagle was hanging the thing around my neck, and I saw it
was a very curious object indeed. The more I looked at it, the more I marvelled; for not only
was its heavy, darkish, lustrous, and richly mottled substance an absolutely strange metal to
me, but what was left of its design seemed to be of a marvellously artistic and utterly unknown
workmanship. One side, so far as I could see, had borne an exquisitely modelled serpent design;
whilst the other side had depicted a kind of octopus or other tentacled monster. There were
some half-effaced hieroglyphs, too, of a kind which no archaeologist could identify or even
place conjecturally. With Grey Eagle’s permission I later had expert historians, anthropologists,
geologists, and chemists pass carefully upon the disc, but from them I obtained only a chorus
of bafflement. It defied either classification or analysis. The chemists called it an amalgam
of unknown metallic elements of heavy atomic weight, and one geologist suggested that the substance
must be of meteoric origin, shot from unknown gulfs of interstellar space. Whether it really
saved my life or sanity or existence as a human being I cannot attempt to say, but Grey Eagle
is sure of it. He has it again, now, and I wonder if it has any connexion with his inordinate
age. All his fathers who had it lived far beyond the century mark, perishing only in battle.
Is it possible that Grey Eagle, if kept from accidents, will never die? But I am ahead of my
story.
When I returned to the village I tried to secure more mound-lore, but found
only excited gossip and opposition. It was really flattering to see how solicitous the people
were about my safety, but I had to set their almost frantic remonstrances aside. I shewed them
Grey Eagle’s charm, but none of them had ever heard of it before, or seen anything even
remotely like it. They agreed that it could not be an Indian relic, and imagined that the old
chief’s ancestors must have obtained it from some trader.
When they saw they could not deter me from my trip, the Binger citizens sadly
did what they could to aid my outfitting. Having known before my arrival the sort of work to
be done, I had most of my supplies already with me—machete and trench-knife for shrub-clearing
and excavating, electric torches for any underground phase which might develop, rope, field-glasses,
tape-measure, microscope, and incidentals for emergencies—as much, in fact, as might be
comfortably stowed in a convenient handbag. To this equipment I added only the heavy revolver
which the sheriff forced upon me, and the pick and shovel which I thought might expedite my
work.
I decided to carry these latter things slung over my shoulder with a stout
cord—for I soon saw that I could not hope for any helpers or fellow-explorers. The village
would watch me, no doubt, with all its available telescopes and field-glasses; but it would
not send any citizen so much as a yard over the flat plain toward the lone hillock. My start
was timed for early the next morning, and all the rest of that day I was treated with the awed
and uneasy respect which people give to a man about to set out for certain doom.
When morning came—a cloudy though not a threatening morning—the
whole village turned out to see me start across the dustblown plain. Binoculars shewed the lone
man at his usual pacing on the mound, and I resolved to keep him in sight as steadily as possible
during my approach. At the last moment a vague sense of dread oppressed me, and I was just weak
and whimsical enough to let Grey Eagle’s talisman swing on my chest in full view of any
beings or ghosts who might be inclined to heed it. Bidding au revoir to Compton and his mother,
I started off at a brisk stride despite the bag in my left hand and the clanking pick and shovel
strapped to my back; holding my field-glass in my right hand and taking a glance at the silent
pacer from time to time. As I neared the mound I saw the man very clearly, and fancied I could
trace an expression of infinite evil and decadence on his seamed, hairless features. I was startled,
too, to see that his goldenly gleaming weapon-case bore hieroglyphs very similar to those on
the unknown talisman I wore. All the creature’s costume and trappings bespoke exquisite
workmanship and cultivation. Then, all too abruptly, I saw him start down the farther side of
the mound and out of sight. When I reached the place, about ten minutes after I set out, there
was no one there.
There is no need of relating how I spent the early part of my search in surveying
and circumnavigating the mound, taking measurements, and stepping back to view the thing from
different angles. It had impressed me tremendously as I approached it, and there seemed to be
a kind of latent menace in its too regular outlines. It was the only elevation of any sort on
the wide, level plain; and I could not doubt for a moment that it was an artificial tumulus.
The steep sides seemed wholly unbroken, and without marks of human tenancy or passage. There
were no signs of a path toward the top; and, burdened as I was, I managed to scramble up only
with considerable difficulty. When I reached the summit I found a roughly level elliptical plateau
about 300 by 50 feet in dimensions; uniformly covered with rank grass and dense underbrush,
and utterly incompatible with the constant presence of a pacing sentinel. This condition gave
me a real shock, for it shewed beyond question that the “Old Indian”, vivid though
he seemed, could not be other than a collective hallucination.
I looked about with considerable perplexity and alarm, glancing wistfully back
at the village and the mass of black dots which I knew was the watching crowd. Training my glass
upon them, I saw that they were studying me avidly with their glasses; so to reassure them I
waved my cap in the air with a show of jauntiness which I was far from feeling. Then, settling
to my work I flung down pick, shovel, and bag; taking my machete from the latter and commencing
to clear away underbrush. It was a weary task, and now and then I felt a curious shiver as some
perverse gust of wind arose to hamper my motion with a skill approaching deliberateness. At
times it seemed as if a half-tangible force were pushing me back as I worked—almost as
if the air thickened in front of me, or as if formless hands tugged at my wrists. My energy
seemed used up without producing adequate results, yet for all that I made some progress.
By afternoon I had clearly perceived that, toward the northern end of the mound,
there was a slight bowl-like depression in the root-tangled earth. While this might mean nothing,
it would be a good place to begin when I reached the digging stage, and I made a mental note
of it. At the same time I noticed another and very peculiar thing—namely, that the Indian
talisman swinging from my neck seemed to behave oddly at a point about seventeen feet southeast
of the suggested bowl. Its gyrations were altered whenever I happened to stoop around that point,
and it tugged downward as if attracted by some magnetism in the soil. The more I noticed this,
the more it struck me, till at length I decided to do a little preliminary digging there without
further delay.
As I turned up the soil with my trench-knife I could not help wondering at
the relative thinness of the reddish regional layer. The country as a whole was all red sandstone
earth, but here I found a strange black loam less than a foot down. It was such soil as one
finds in the strange, deep valleys farther west and south, and must surely have been brought
from a considerable distance in the prehistoric age when the mound was reared. Kneeling and
digging, I felt the leathern cord around my neck tugged harder and harder, as something in the
soil seemed to draw the heavy metal talisman more and more. Then I felt my implements strike
a hard surface, and wondered if a rock layer rested beneath. Prying about with the trench-knife,
I found that such was not the case. Instead, to my intense surprise and feverish interest, I
brought up a mould-clogged, heavy object of cylindrical shape—about a foot long and four
inches in diameter—to which my hanging talisman clove with glue-like tenacity. As I cleared
off the black loam my wonder and tension increased at the bas-reliefs revealed by that process.
The whole cylinder, ends and all, was covered with figures and hieroglyphs; and I saw with growing
excitement that these things were in the same unknown tradition as those on Grey Eagle’s
charm and on the yellow metal trappings of the ghost I had seen through my binoculars.
Sitting down, I further cleaned the magnetic cylinder against the rough corduroy
of my knickerbockers, and observed that it was made of the same heavy, lustrous unknown metal
as the charm—hence, no doubt, the singular attraction. The carvings and chasings were very strange
and very horrible—nameless monsters and designs fraught with insidious evil—and
all were of the highest finish and craftsmanship. I could not at first make head or tail of
the thing, and handled it aimlessly until I spied a cleavage near one end. Then I sought eagerly
for some mode of opening, discovering at last that the end simply unscrewed.
The cap yielded with difficulty, but at last it came off, liberating a curious
aromatic odour. The sole contents was a bulky roll of a yellowish, paper-like substance inscribed
in greenish characters, and for a second I had the supreme thrill of fancying that I held a
written key to unknown elder worlds and abysses beyond time. Almost immediately, however, the
unrolling of one end shewed that the manuscript was in Spanish—albeit the formal, pompous
Spanish of a long-departed day. In the golden sunset light I looked at the heading and the opening
paragraph, trying to decipher the wretched and ill-punctuated script of the vanished writer.
What manner of relic was this? Upon what sort of a discovery had I stumbled? The first words
set me in a new fury of excitement and curiosity, for instead of diverting me from my original
quest they startlingly confirmed me in that very effort.
The yellow scroll with the green script began with a bold, identifying caption
and a ceremoniously desperate appeal for belief in incredible revelations to follow:

RELACIÓN DE PÁNFILO DE ZAMACONA Y NUÑEZ, HIDALGO DE LUARCA
EN ASTURIAS, TOCANTE AL MUNDO SOTERRÁNEO DE XINAIÁN, A. D. MDXLV

En el nombre de la santísima Trinidad, Padre, Hijo, y Espíritu-Santo,
tres personas distintas y un solo. Dios verdadero, y de la santísima Virgen muestra Señora,
YO, PÁNFILO DE ZAMACONA, HIJO DE PEDRO GUZMAN Y ZAMACONA, HIDALGO, Y DE LA DOÑA
YNÉS ALVARADO Y NUÑEZ, DE LUARCA EN ASTURIAS, juro para que todo que deco está
verdadero como sacramento. . . .
I paused to reflect on the portentous significance of what I was reading. “The
Narrative of Pánfilo de Zamacona y Nuñez, gentleman, of Luarca in Asturias, 
Concerning the Subterranean World of Xinaián, A. D. 1545” . . . Here,
surely, was too much for any mind to absorb all at once. A subterranean world—again that
persistent idea which filtered through all the Indian tales and through all the utterances of
those who had come back from the mound. And the date—1545—what could this mean?
In 1540 Coronado and his men had gone north from Mexico into the wilderness, but had they not
turned back in 1542! My eye ran questingly down the opened part of the scroll, and almost at
once seized on the name Francisco Vásquez de Coronado. The writer of this thing,
clearly, was one of Coronado’s men—but what had he been doing in this remote realm
three years after his party had gone back? I must read further, for another glance told me that
what was now unrolled was merely a summary of Coronado’s northward march, differing in
no essential way from the account known to history.
It was only the waning light which checked me before I could unroll and read
more, and in my impatient bafflement I almost forgot to be frightened at the onrush of night
in this sinister place. Others, however, had not forgotten the lurking terror, for I heard a
loud distant hallooing from a knot of men who had gathered at the edge of the town. Answering
the anxious hail, I restored the manuscript to its strange cylinder—to which the disc
around my neck still clung until I pried it off and packed it and my smaller implements for
departure. Leaving the pick and shovel for the next day’s work, I took up my handbag,
scrambled down the steep side of the mound, and in another quarter-hour was back in the village
explaining and exhibiting my curious find. As darkness drew on, I glanced back at the mound
I had so lately left, and saw with a shudder that the faint bluish torch of the nocturnal squaw-ghost
had begun to glimmer.
It was hard work waiting to get at the bygone Spaniard’s narrative; but
I knew I must have quiet and leisure for a good translation, so reluctantly saved the task for
the later hours of night. Promising the townsfolk a clear account of my findings in the morning,
and giving them an ample opportunity to examine the bizarre and provocative cylinder, I accompanied
Clyde Compton home and ascended to my room for the translating process as soon as I possibly
could. My host and his mother were intensely eager to hear the tale, but I thought they had
better wait till I could thoroughly absorb the text myself and give them the gist concisely
and unerringly.
Opening my handbag in the light of a single electric bulb, I again took out
the cylinder and noted the instant magnetism which pulled the Indian talisman to its carven
surface. The designs glimmered evilly on the richly lustrous and unknown metal, and I could
not help shivering as I studied the abnormal and blasphemous forms that leered at me with such
exquisite workmanship. I wish now that I had carefully photographed all these designs—though
perhaps it is just as well that I did not. Of one thing I am really glad, and that is that I
could not then identify the squatting octopus-headed thing which dominated most of the ornate
cartouches, and which the manuscript called “Tulu”. Recently I have associated it,
and the legends in the manuscript connected with it, with some new-found folklore of monstrous
and unmentioned Cthulhu, a horror which seeped down from the stars while the young earth was
still half-formed; and had I known of the connexion then, I could not have stayed in the same
room with the thing. The secondary motif, a semi-anthropomorphic serpent, I did quite readily
place as a prototype of the Yig, Quetzalcoatl, and Kukulcan conceptions. Before opening the
cylinder I tested its magnetic powers on metals other than that of Grey Eagle’s disc,
but found that no attraction existed. It was no common magnetism which pervaded this morbid
fragment of unknown worlds and linked it to its kind.
At last I took out the manuscript and began translating—jotting down a synoptic
outline in English as I went, and now and then regretting the absence of a Spanish dictionary
when I came upon some especially obscure or archaic word or construction. There was a sense
of ineffable strangeness in thus being thrown back nearly four centuries in the midst of my
continuous quest—thrown back to a year when my own forbears were settled, homekeeping
gentlemen of Somerset and Devon under Henry the Eighth, with never a thought of the adventure
that was to take their blood to Virginia and the New World; yet when that new world possessed,
even as now, the same brooding mystery of the mound which formed my present sphere and horizon.
The sense of a throwback was all the stronger because I felt instinctively that the common problem
of the Spaniard and myself was one of such abysmal timelessness—of such unholy and unearthly
eternity—that the scant four hundred years between us bulked as nothing in comparison.
It took no more than a single look at that monstrous and insidious cylinder to make me realise
the dizzying gulfs that yawned between all men of the known earth and the primal mysteries it
represented. Before that gulf Pánfilo de Zamacona and I stood side by side; just as Aristotle
and I, or Cheops and I, might have stood.
III.

Of his youth in Luarca, a small, placid port on the Bay of Biscay, Zamacona
told little. He had been wild, and a younger son, and had come to New Spain in 1532, when only
twenty years old. Sensitively imaginative, he had listened spellbound to the floating rumours
of rich cities and unknown worlds to the north—and especially to the tale of the Franciscan
friar Marcos de Niza, who came back from a trip in 1539 with glowing accounts of fabulous Cíbola
and its great walled towns with terraced stone houses. Hearing of Coronado’s contemplated
expedition in search of these wonders—and of the greater wonders whispered to lie beyond
them in the land of buffaloes—young Zamacona managed to join the picked party of 300,
and started north with the rest in 1540.
History knows the story of that expedition—how Cíbola was found
to be merely the squalid Pueblo village of Zuñi, and how de Niza was sent back to Mexico
in disgrace for his florid exaggerations; how Coronado first saw the Grand Canyon, and how at
Cicuyé, on the Pecos, he heard from the Indian called El Turco of the rich and mysterious
land of Quivira, far to the northeast, where gold, silver, and buffaloes abounded, and where
there flowed a river two leagues wide. Zamacona told briefly of the winter camp at Tiguex on
the Pecos, and of the northward start in April, when the native guide proved false and led the
party astray amidst a land of prairie-dogs, salt pools, and roving, bison-hunting tribes.
When Coronado dismissed his larger force and made his final forty-two-day march
with a very small and select detachment, Zamacona managed to be included in the advancing party.
He spoke of the fertile country and of the great ravines with trees visible only from the edge
of their steep banks; and of how all the men lived solely on buffalo-meat. And then came mention
of the expedition’s farthest limit—of the presumable but disappointing land of Quivira
with its villages of grass houses, its brooks and rivers, its good black soil, its plums, nuts,
grapes, and mulberries, and its maize-growing and copper-using Indians. The execution of El
Turco, the false native guide, was casually touched upon, and there was a mention of the cross
which Coronado raised on the bank of a great river in the autumn of 1541—a cross bearing
the inscription, “Thus far came the great general, Francisco Vásquez de Coronado”.
This supposed Quivira lay at about the fortieth parallel of north latitude,
and I see that quite lately the New York archaeologist Dr. Hodge has identified it with the
course of the Arkansas River through Barton and Rice Counties, Kansas. It is the old home of
the Wichitas, before the Sioux drove them south into what is now Oklahoma, and some of the grass-house
village sites have been found and excavated for artifacts. Coronado did considerable exploring
hereabouts, led hither and thither by the persistent rumours of rich cities and hidden worlds
which floated fearfully around on the Indians’ tongues. These northerly natives seemed
more afraid and reluctant to talk about the rumoured cities and worlds than the Mexican Indians
had been; yet at the same time seemed as if they could reveal a good deal more than the Mexicans
had they been willing or dared to do so. Their vagueness exasperated the Spanish leader, and
after many disappointing searches he began to be very severe toward those who brought him stories.
Zamacona, more patient than Coronado, found the tales especially interesting; and learned enough
of the local speech to hold long conversations with a young buck named Charging Buffalo, whose
curiosity had led him into much stranger places than any of his fellow-tribesmen had dared to
penetrate.
It was Charging Buffalo who told Zamacona of the queer stone doorways, gates,
or cave-mouths at the bottom of some of those deep, steep, wooded ravines which the party had
noticed on the northward march. These openings, he said, were mostly concealed by shrubbery;
and few had entered them for untold aeons. Those who went to where they led, never returned—or
in a few cases returned mad or curiously maimed. But all this was legend, for nobody was known
to have gone more than a limited distance inside any of them within the memory of the grandfathers
of the oldest living men. Charging Buffalo himself had probably been farther than anyone else,
and he had seen enough to curb both his curiosity and his greed for the rumoured gold below.
Beyond the aperture he had entered there was a long passage running crazily
up and down and round about, and covered with frightful carvings of monsters and horrors that
no man had ever seen. At last, after untold miles of windings and descents, there was a glow
of terrible blue light; and the passage opened upon a shocking nether world. About this the
Indian would say no more, for he had seen something that had sent him back in haste. But the
golden cities must be somewhere down there, he added, and perhaps a white man with the magic
of the thunder-stick might succeed in getting to them. He would not tell the big chief Coronado
what he knew, for Coronado would not listen to Indian talk any more. Yes—he could shew
Zamacona the way if the white man would leave the party and accept his guidance. But he would
not go inside the opening with the white man. It was bad in there.
The place was about a five days’ march to the south, near the region
of great mounds. These mounds had something to do with the evil world down there—they
were probably ancient closed-up passages to it, for once the Old Ones below had had colonies
on the surface and had traded with men everywhere, even in the lands that had sunk under the
big waters. It was when those lands had sunk that the Old Ones closed themselves up below and
refused to deal with surface people. The refugees from the sinking places had told them that
the gods of outer earth were against men, and that no men could survive on the outer earth unless
they were daemons in league with the evil gods. That is why they shut out all surface folk,
and did fearful things to any who ventured down where they dwelt. There had been sentries once
at the various openings, but after ages they were no longer needed. Not many people cared to
talk about the hidden Old Ones, and the legends about them would probably have died out but
for certain ghostly reminders of their presence now and then. It seemed that the infinite ancientness
of these creatures had brought them strangely near to the borderline of spirit, so that their
ghostly emanations were more commonly frequent and vivid. Accordingly the region of the great
mounds was often convulsed with spectral nocturnal battles reflecting those which had been fought
in the days before the openings were closed.
The Old Ones themselves were half-ghost—indeed, it was said that they
no longer grew old or reproduced their kind, but flickered eternally in a state between flesh
and spirit. The change was not complete, though, for they had to breathe. It was because the
underground world needed air that the openings in the deep valleys were not blocked up as the
mound-openings on the plains had been. These openings, Charging Buffalo added, were probably
based on natural fissures in the earth. It was whispered that the Old Ones had come down from
the stars to the world when it was very young, and had gone inside to build their cities of
solid gold because the surface was not then fit to live on. They were the ancestors of all men,
yet none could guess from what star—or what place beyond the stars—they came. Their
hidden cities were still full of gold and silver, but men had better let them alone unless protected
by very strong magic.
They had frightful beasts with a faint strain of human blood, on which they
rode, and which they employed for other purposes. The things, so people hinted, were carnivorous,
and like their masters, preferred human flesh; so that although the Old Ones themselves did
not breed, they had a sort of half-human slave-class which also served to nourish the human
and animal population. This had been very oddly recruited, and was supplemented by a second
slave-class of reanimated corpses. The Old Ones knew how to make a corpse into an automaton
which would last almost indefinitely and perform any sort of work when directed by streams of
thought. Charging Buffalo said that the people had all come to talk by means of thought only;
speech having been found crude and needless, except for religious devotions and emotional expression,
as aeons of discovery and study rolled by. They worshipped Yig, the great father of serpents,
and Tulu, the octopus-headed entity that had brought them down from the stars; appeasing both
of these hideous monstrosities by means of human sacrifices offered up in a very curious manner
which Charging Buffalo did not care to describe.
Zamacona was held spellbound by the Indian’s tale, and at once resolved
to accept his guidance to the cryptic doorway in the ravine. He did not believe the accounts
of strange ways attributed by legend to the hidden people, for the experiences of the party
had been such as to disillusion one regarding native myths of unknown lands; but he did feel
that some sufficiently marvellous field of riches and adventure must indeed lie beyond the weirdly
carved passages in the earth. At first he thought of persuading Charging Buffalo to tell his
story to Coronado—offering to shield him against any effects of the leader’s testy
scepticism—but later he decided that a lone adventure would be better. If he had no aid,
he would not have to share anything he found; but might perhaps become a great discoverer and
owner of fabulous riches. Success would make him a greater figure than Coronado himself—perhaps
a greater figure than anyone else in New Spain, including even the mighty viceroy Don Antonio
de Mendoza.
On October 7, 1541, at an hour close to midnight, Zamacona stole out of the
Spanish camp near the grass-house village and met Charging Buffalo for the long southward journey.
He travelled as lightly as possible, and did not wear his heavy helmet and breastplate. Of the
details of the trip the manuscript told very little, but Zamacona records his arrival at the
great ravine on October 13th. The descent of the thickly wooded slope took no great time; and
though the Indian had trouble in locating the shrubbery-hidden stone door again amidst the twilight
of that deep gorge, the place was finally found. It was a very small aperture as doorways go,
formed of monolithic sandstone jambs and lintel, and bearing signs of nearly effaced and now
undecipherable carvings. Its height was perhaps seven feet, and its width not more than four.
There were drilled places in the jambs which argued the bygone presence of a hinged door or
gate, but all other traces of such a thing had long since vanished.
At sight of this black gulf Charging Buffalo displayed considerable fear, and
threw down his pack of supplies with signs of haste. He had provided Zamacona with a good stock
of resinous torches and provisions, and had guided him honestly and well; but refused to share
in the venture that lay ahead. Zamacona gave him the trinkets he had kept for such an occasion,
and obtained his promise to return to the region in a month; afterward shewing the way southward
to the Pecos Pueblo villages. A prominent rock on the plain above them was chosen as a meeting-place;
the one arriving first to pitch camp until the other should arrive.
In the manuscript Zamacona expressed a wistful wonder as to the Indian’s
length of waiting at the rendezvous—for he himself could never keep that tryst. At the
last moment Charging Buffalo tried to dissuade him from his plunge into the darkness, but soon
saw it was futile, and gestured a stoical farewell. Before lighting his first torch and entering
the opening with his ponderous pack, the Spaniard watched the lean form of the Indian scrambling
hastily and rather relievedly upward among the trees. It was the cutting of his last link with
the world; though he did not know that he was never to see a human being—in the accepted
sense of that term—again.
Zamacona felt no immediate premonition of evil upon entering that ominous doorway,
though from the first he was surrounded by a bizarre and unwholesome atmosphere. The passage,
slightly taller and wider than the aperture, was for many yards a level tunnel of Cyclopean
masonry, with heavily worn flagstones under foot, and grotesquely carved granite and sandstone
blocks in sides and ceiling. The carvings must have been loathsome and terrible indeed, to judge
from Zamacona’s description; according to which most of them revolved around the monstrous
beings Yig and Tulu. They were unlike anything the adventurer had ever seen before, though he
added that the native architecture of Mexico came closest to them of all things in the outer
world. After some distance the tunnel began to dip abruptly, and irregular natural rock appeared
on all sides. The passage seemed only partly artificial, and decorations were limited to occasional
cartouches with shocking bas-reliefs.
Following an enormous descent, whose steepness at times produced an acute danger
of slipping and tobogganing, the passage became exceedingly uncertain in its direction and variable
in its contour. At times it narrowed almost to a slit or grew so low that stooping and even
crawling were necessary, while at other times it broadened out into sizeable caves or chains
of caves. Very little human construction, it was plain, had gone into this part of the tunnel;
though occasionally a sinister cartouche or hieroglyphic on the wall, or a blocked-up lateral
passageway, would remind Zamacona that this was in truth the aeon-forgotten high-road to a primal
and unbelievable world of living things.
For three days, as best he could reckon, Pánfilo de Zamacona scrambled
down, up, along, and around, but always predominately downward, through this dark region of
palaeogean night. Once in a while he heard some secret being of darkness patter or flap out
of his way, and on just one occasion he half glimpsed a great, bleached thing that set him trembling.
The quality of the air was mostly very tolerable; though foetid zones were now and then met
with, while one great cavern of stalactites and stalagmites afforded a depressing dampness.
This latter, when Charging Buffalo had come upon it, had quite seriously barred the way; since
the limestone deposits of ages had built fresh pillars in the path of the primordial abyss-denizens.
The Indian, however, had broken through these; so that Zamacona did not find his course impeded.
It was an unconscious comfort to him to reflect that someone else from the outside world had
been there before—and the Indian’s careful descriptions had removed the element
of surprise and unexpectedness. More—Charging Buffalo’s knowledge of the tunnel
had led him to provide so good a torch supply for the journey in and out, that there would be
no danger of becoming stranded in darkness. Zamacona camped twice, building a fire whose smoke
seemed well taken care of by the natural ventilation.
At what he considered the end of the third day—though his cocksure guesswork
chronology is not at any time to be given the easy faith that he gave it—Zamacona encountered
the prodigious descent and subsequent prodigious climb which Charging Buffalo had described
as the tunnel’s last phase. As at certain earlier points, marks of artificial improvement
were here discernible; and several times the steep gradient was eased by a flight of rough-hewn
steps. The torch shewed more and more of the monstrous carvings on the walls, and finally the
resinous flare seemed mixed with a fainter and more diffusive light as Zamacona climbed up and
up after the last downward stairway. At length the ascent ceased, and a level passage of artificial
masonry with dark, basaltic blocks led straight ahead. There was no need for a torch now, for
all the air was glowing with a bluish, quasi-electric radiance that flickered like an aurora.
It was the strange light of the inner world that the Indian had described—and in another
moment Zamacona emerged from the tunnel upon a bleak, rocky hillside which climbed above him
to a seething, impenetrable sky of bluish coruscations, and descended dizzily below him to an
apparently illimitable plain shrouded in bluish mist.
He had come to the unknown world at last, and from his manuscript it is clear
that he viewed the formless landscape as proudly and exaltedly as ever his fellow-countryman
Balboa viewed the new-found Pacific from that unforgettable peak in Darien. Charging Buffalo
had turned back at this point, driven by fear of something which he would only describe vaguely
and evasively as a herd of bad cattle, neither horse nor buffalo, but like the things the mound-spirits
rode at night—but Zamacona could not be deterred by any such trifle. Instead of fear,
a strange sense of glory filled him; for he had imagination enough to know what it meant to
stand alone in an inexplicable nether world whose existence no other white man suspected.
The soil of the great hill that surged upward behind him and spread steeply
downward below him was dark grey, rock-strown, without vegetation, and probably basaltic in
origin; with an unearthly cast which made him feel like an intruder on an alien planet. The
vast distant plain, thousands of feet below, had no features he could distinguish; especially
since it appeared to be largely veiled in a curling, bluish vapour. But more than hill or plain
or cloud, the bluely luminous, coruscating sky impressed the adventurer with a sense of supreme
wonder and mystery. What created this sky within a world he could not tell; though he knew of
the northern lights, and had even seen them once or twice. He concluded that this subterraneous
light was something vaguely akin to the aurora; a view which moderns may well endorse, though
it seems likely that certain phenomena of radio-activity may also enter in.
At Zamacona’s back the mouth of the tunnel he had traversed yawned darkly;
defined by a stone doorway very like the one he had entered in the world above, save that it
was of greyish-black basalt instead of red sandstone. There were hideous sculptures, still in
good preservation and perhaps corresponding to those on the outer portal which time had largely
weathered away. The absence of weathering here argued a dry, temperate climate; indeed, the
Spaniard already began to note the delightfully spring-like stability of temperature which marks
the air of the north’s interior. On the stone jambs were works proclaiming the bygone
presence of hinges, but of any actual door or gate no trace remained. Seating himself for rest
and thought, Zamacona lightened his pack by removing an amount of food and torches sufficient
to take him back through the tunnel. These he proceeded to cache at the opening, under a cairn
hastily formed of the rock fragments which everywhere lay around. Then, readjusting his lightened
pack, he commenced his descent toward the distant plain; preparing to invade a region which
no living thing of outer earth had penetrated in a century or more, which no white man had ever
penetrated, and from which, if legend were to be believed, no organic creature had ever returned
sane.
Zamacona strode briskly along down the steep, interminable slope; his progress
checked at times by the bad walking that came from loose rock fragments, or by the excessive
precipitousness of the grade. The distance of the mist-shrouded plain must have been enormous,
for many hours’ walking brought him apparently no closer to it than he had been before.
Behind him was always the great hill stretching upward into a bright aërial sea of bluish
coruscations. Silence was universal; so that his own footsteps, and the fall of stones that
he dislodged, struck on his ears with startling distinctness. It was at what he regarded as
about noon that he first saw the abnormal footprints which set him to thinking of Charging Buffalo’s
terrible hints, precipitate flight, and strangely abiding terror.
The rock-strown nature of the soil gave few opportunities for tracks of any
kind, but at one point a rather level interval had caused the loose detritus to accumulate in
a ridge, leaving a considerable area of dark-grey loam absolutely bare. Here, in a rambling
confusion indicating a large herd aimlessly wandering, Zamacona found the abnormal prints. It
is to be regretted that he could not describe them more exactly, but the manuscript displayed
far more vague fear than accurate observation. Just what it was that so frightened the Spaniard
can only be inferred from his later hints regarding the beasts. He referred to the prints as
‘not hooves, nor hands, nor feet, nor precisely paws—nor so large as to cause alarm
on that account’. Just why or how long ago the things had been there, was not easy to
guess. There was no vegetation visible, hence grazing was out of the question; but of course
if the beasts were carnivorous they might well have been hunting smaller animals, whose tracks
their own would tend to obliterate.
Glancing backward from this plateau to the heights above, Zamacona thought
he detected traces of a great winding road which had once led from the tunnel downward to the
plain. One could get the impression of this former highway only from a broad panoramic view,
since a trickle of loose rock fragments had long ago obscured it; but the adventurer felt none
the less certain that it had existed. It had not, probably, been an elaborately paved trunk
route; for the small tunnel it reached seemed scarcely like a main avenue to the outer world.
In choosing a straight path of descent Zamacona had not followed its curving course, though
he must have crossed it once or twice. With his attention now called to it, he looked ahead
to see if he could trace it downward toward the plain; and this he finally thought he could
do. He resolved to investigate its surface when next he crossed it, and perhaps to pursue its
line for the rest of the way if he could distinguish it.
Having resumed his journey, Zamacona came some time later upon what he thought
was a bend of the ancient road. There were signs of grading and of some primal attempt at rock-surfacing,
but not enough was left to make the route worth following. While rummaging about in the soil
with his sword, the Spaniard turned up something that glittered in the eternal blue daylight,
and was thrilled at beholding a kind of coin or medal of a dark, unknown, lustrous metal, with
hideous designs on each side. It was utterly and bafflingly alien to him, and from his description
I have no doubt but that it was a duplicate of the talisman given me by Grey Eagle almost four
centuries afterward. Pocketing it after a long and curious examination, he strode onward; finally
pitching camp at an hour which he guessed to be the evening of the outer world.
The next day Zamacona rose early and resumed his descent through this blue-litten
world of mist and desolation and preternatural silence. As he advanced, he at last became able
to distinguish a few objects on the distant plain below—trees, bushes, rocks, and a small
river that came into view from the right and curved forward at a point to the left of his contemplated
course. This river seemed to be spanned by a bridge connected with the descending roadway, and
with care the explorer could trace the route of the road beyond it in a straight line over the
plain. Finally he even thought he could detect towns scattered along the rectilinear ribbon;
towns whose left-hand edges reached the river and sometimes crossed it. Where such crossings
occurred, he saw as he descended, there were always signs of bridges either ruined or surviving.
He was now in the midst of a sparse grassy vegetation, and saw that below him the growth became
thicker and thicker. The road was easier to define now, since its surface discouraged the grass
which the looser soil supported. Rock fragments were less frequent, and the barren upward vista
behind him looked bleak and forbidding in contrast to his present milieu.
It was on this day that he saw the blurred mass moving over the distant plain.
Since his first sight of the sinister footprints he had met with no more of these, but something
about that slowly and deliberately moving mass peculiarly sickened him. Nothing but a herd of
grazing animals could move just like that, and after seeing the footprints he did not wish to
meet the things which had made them. Still, the moving mass was not near the road—and
his curiosity and greed for fabled gold were great. Besides, who could really judge things from
vague, jumbled footprints or from the panic-twisted hints of an ignorant Indian?
In straining his eyes to view the moving mass Zamacona became aware of several
other interesting things. One was that certain parts of the now unmistakable towns glittered
oddly in the misty blue light. Another was that, besides the towns, several similarly glittering
structures of a more isolated sort were scattered here and there along the road and over the
plain. They seemed to be embowered in clumps of vegetation, and those off the road had small
avenues leading to the highway. No smoke or other signs of life could be discerned about any
of the towns or buildings. Finally Zamacona saw that the plain was not infinite in extent, though
the half-concealing blue mists had hitherto made it seem so. It was bounded in the remote distance
by a range of low hills, toward a gap in which the river and roadway seemed to lead. All this—especially
the glittering of certain pinnacles in the towns—had become very vivid when Zamacona pitched
his second camp amidst the endless blue day. He likewise noticed the flocks of high-soaring
birds, whose nature he could not clearly make out.
The next afternoon—to use the language of the outer world as the manuscript
did at all times—Zamacona reached the silent plain and crossed the soundless, slow-running
river on a curiously carved and fairly well-preserved bridge of black basalt. The water was
clear, and contained large fishes of a wholly strange aspect. The roadway was now paved and
somewhat overgrown with weeds and creeping vines, and its course was occasionally outlined by
small pillars bearing obscure symbols. On every side the grassy level extended, with here and
there a clump of trees or shrubbery, and with unidentifiable bluish flowers growing irregularly
over the whole area. Now and then some spasmodic motion of the grass indicated the presence
of serpents. In the course of several hours the traveller reached a grove of old and alien-looking
evergreen-trees which he knew, from distant viewing, protected one of the glittering-roofed
isolated structures. Amidst the encroaching vegetation he saw the hideously sculptured pylons
of a stone gateway leading off the road, and was presently forcing his way through briers above
a moss-crusted tessellated walk lined with huge trees and low monolithic pillars.
At last, in this hushed green twilight, he saw the crumbling and ineffably
ancient facade of the building—a temple, he had no doubt. It was a mass of nauseous bas-reliefs;
depicting scenes and beings, objects and ceremonies, which could certainly have no place on
this or any sane planet. In hinting of these things Zamacona displays for the first time that
shocked and pious hesitancy which impairs the informative value of the rest of his manuscript.
We cannot help regretting that the Catholic ardour of Renaissance Spain had so thoroughly permeated
his thought and feeling. The door of the place stood wide open, and absolute darkness filled
the windowless interior. Conquering the repulsion which the mural sculptures had excited, Zamacona
took out flint and steel, lighted a resinous torch, pushed aside curtaining vines, and sallied
boldly across the ominous threshold.
For a moment he was quite stupefied by what he saw. It was not the all-covering
dust and cobwebs of immemorial aeons, the fluttering winged things, the shriekingly loathsome
sculptures on the walls, the bizarre form of the many basins and braziers, the sinister pyramidal
altar with the hollow top, or the monstrous, octopus-headed abnormality in some strange, dark
metal leering and squatting broodingly on its hieroglyphed pedestal, which robbed him of even
the power to give a startled cry. It was nothing so unearthly as this—but merely the fact
that, with the exception of the dust, the cobwebs, the winged things, and the gigantic emerald-eyed
idol, every particle of substance in sight was composed of pure and evidently solid gold.
Even the manuscript, written in retrospect after Zamacona knew that gold is
the most common structural metal of a nether world containing limitless lodes and veins of it,
reflects the frenzied excitement which the traveller felt upon suddenly finding the real source
of all the Indian legends of golden cities. For a time the power of detailed observation left
him, but in the end his faculties were recalled by a peculiar tugging sensation in the pocket
of his doublet. Tracing the feeling, he realised that the disc of strange metal he had found
in the abandoned road was being attracted strongly by the vast octopus-headed, emerald-eyed
idol on the pedestal, which he now saw to be composed of the same unknown exotic metal. He was
later to learn that this strange magnetic substance—as alien to the inner world as to
the outer world of men—is the one precious metal of the blue-lighted abyss. None knows
what it is or where it occurs in Nature, and the amount of it on this planet came down from
the stars with the people when great Tulu, the octopus-headed god, brought them for the first
time to this earth. Certainly, its only known source was a stock of pre-existing artifacts,
including multitudes of Cyclopean idols. It could never be placed or analysed, and even its
magnetism was exerted only on its own kind. It was the supreme ceremonial metal of the hidden
people, its use being regulated by custom in such a way that its magnetic properties might cause
no inconvenience. A very weakly magnetic alloy of it with such base metals as iron, gold, silver,
copper, or zinc, had formed the sole monetary standard of the hidden people at one period of
their history.
Zamacona’s reflections on the strange idol and its magnetism were disturbed
by a tremendous wave of fear as, for the first time in this silent world, he heard a rumble
of very definite and obviously approaching sound. There was no mistaking its nature. It was
a thunderously charging herd of large animals; and, remembering the Indian’s panic, the
footprints, and the moving mass distantly seen, the Spaniard shuddered in terrified anticipation.
He did not analyse his position, or the significance of this onrush of great lumbering beings,
but merely responded to an elemental urge toward self-protection. Charging herds do not stop
to find victims in obscure places, and on the outer earth Zamacona would have felt little or
no alarm in such a massive, grove-girt edifice. Some instinct, however, now bred a deep and
peculiar terror in his soul; and he looked about frantically for any means of safety.
There being no available refuge in the great, gold-patined interior, he felt
that he must close the long-disused door; which still hung on its ancient hinges, doubled back
against the inner wall. Soil, vines, and moss had entered the opening from outside, so that
he had to dig a path for the great gold portal with his sword; but he managed to perform this
work very swiftly under the frightful stimulus of the approaching noise. The hoofbeats had grown
still louder and more menacing by the time he began tugging at the heavy door itself; and for
a while his fears reached a frantic height, as hope of starting the age-clogged metal grew faint.
Then, with a creak, the thing responded to his youthful strength, and a frenzied siege of pulling
and pushing ensued. Amidst the roar of unseen stampeding feet success came at last, and the
ponderous golden door clanged shut, leaving Zamacona in darkness but for the single lighted
torch he had wedged between the pillars of a basin-tripod. There was a latch, and the frightened
man blessed his patron saint that it was still effective.
Sound alone told the fugitive the sequel. When the roar grew very near it resolved
itself into separate footfalls, as if the evergreen grove had made it necessary for the herd
to slacken speed and disperse. But feet continued to approach, and it became evident that the
beasts were advancing among the trees and circling the hideously carven temple walls. In the
curious deliberation of their tread Zamacona found something very alarming and repulsive, nor
did he like the scuffling sounds which were audible even through the thick stone walls and heavy
golden door. Once the door rattled ominously on its archaic hinges, as if under a heavy impact,
but fortunately it still held. Then, after a seemingly endless interval, he heard retreating
steps and realised that his unknown visitors were leaving. Since the herds did not seem to be
very numerous, it would have perhaps been safe to venture out within a half-hour or less; but
Zamacona took no chances. Opening his pack, he prepared his camp on the golden tiles of the
temple’s floor, with the great door still securely latched against all comers; drifting
eventually into a sounder sleep than he could have known in the blue-litten spaces outside.
He did not even mind the hellish, octopus-headed bulk of great Tulu, fashioned of unknown metal
and leering with fishy, sea-green eyes, which squatted in the blackness above him on its monstrously
hieroglyphed pedestal.
Surrounded by darkness for the first time since leaving the tunnel, Zamacona
slept profoundly and long. He must have more than made up the sleep he had lost at his two previous
camps, when the ceaseless glare of the sky had kept him awake despite his fatigue, for much
distance was covered by other living feet while he lay in his healthily dreamless rest. It is
well that he rested deeply, for there were many strange things to be encountered in his next
period of consciousness.
IV.

What finally roused Zamacona was a thunderous rapping at the door. It beat
through his dreams and dissolved all the lingering mists of drowsiness as soon as he knew what
it was. There could be no mistake about it—it was a definite, human, and peremptory rapping;
performed apparently with some metallic object, and with all the measured quality of conscious
thought or will behind it. As the awakening man rose clumsily to his feet, a sharp vocal note
was added to the summons—someone calling out, in a not unmusical voice, a formula which
the manuscript tries to represent as “oxi, oxi, giathcán ycá relex”.
Feeling sure that his visitors were men and not daemons, and arguing that they could have no
reason for considering him an enemy, Zamacona decided to face them openly and at once; and accordingly
fumbled with the ancient latch till the golden door creaked open from the pressure of those
outside.
As the great portal swung back, Zamacona stood facing a group of about twenty
individuals of an aspect not calculated to give him alarm. They seemed to be Indians; though
their tasteful robes and trappings and swords were not such as he had seen among any of the
tribes of the outer world, while their faces had many subtle differences from the Indian type.
That they did not mean to be irresponsibly hostile, was very clear; for instead of menacing
him in any way they merely probed him attentively and significantly with their eyes, as if they
expected their gaze to open up some sort of communication. The longer they gazed, the more he
seemed to know about them and their mission; for although no one had spoken since the vocal
summons before the opening of the door, he found himself slowly realising that they had come
from the great city beyond the low hills, mounted on animals, and that they had been summoned
by animals who had reported his presence; that they were not sure what kind of person he was
or just where he had come from, but that they knew he must be associated with that dimly remembered
outer world which they sometimes visited in curious dreams. How he read all this in the gaze
of the two or three leaders he could not possibly explain; though he learned why a moment later.
As it was, he attempted to address his visitors in the Wichita dialect he had
picked up from Charging Buffalo; and after this failed to draw a vocal reply he successively
tried the Aztec, Spanish, French, and Latin tongues—adding as many scraps of lame Greek,
Galician, and Portuguese, and of the Bable peasant patois of his native Asturias, as his memory
could recall. But not even this polyglot array—his entire linguistic stock—could
bring a reply in kind. When, however, he paused in perplexity, one of the visitors began speaking
in an utterly strange and rather fascinating language whose sounds the Spaniard later had much
difficulty in representing on paper. Upon his failure to understand this, the speaker pointed
first to his own eyes, then to his forehead, and then to his eyes again, as if commanding the
other to gaze at him in order to absorb what he wanted to transmit.
Zamacona, obeying, found himself rapidly in possession of certain information.
The people, he learned, conversed nowadays by means of unvocal radiations of thought; although
they had formerly used a spoken language which still survived as the written tongue, and into
which they still dropped orally for tradition’s sake, or when strong feeling demanded
a spontaneous outlet. He could understand them merely by concentrating his attention upon their
eyes; and could reply by summoning up a mental image of what he wished to say, and throwing
the substance of this into his glance. When the thought-speaker paused, apparently inviting
a response, Zamacona tried his best to follow the prescribed pattern, but did not appear to
succeed very well. So he nodded, and tried to describe himself and his journey by signs. He
pointed upward, as if to the outer world, then closed his eyes and made signs as of a mole burrowing.
Then he opened his eyes again and pointed downward, in order to indicate his descent of the
great slope. Experimentally he blended a spoken word or two with his gestures—for example,
pointing successively to himself and to all of his visitors and saying “un hombre”,
and then pointing to himself alone and very carefully pronouncing his individual name, Pánfilo
de Zamacona.
Before the strange conversation was over, a good deal of data had passed in
both directions. Zamacona had begun to learn how to throw his thoughts, and had likewise picked
up several words of the region’s archaic spoken language. His visitors, moreover, had
absorbed many beginnings of an elementary Spanish vocabulary. Their own old language was utterly
unlike anything the Spaniard had ever heard, though there were times later on when he was to
fancy an infinitely remote linkage with the Aztec, as if the latter represented some far stage
of corruption, or some very thin infiltration of loan-words. The underground world, Zamacona
learned, bore an ancient name which the manuscript records as “Xinaián”,
but which, from the writer’s supplementary explanations and diacritical marks, could probably
be best represented to Anglo-Saxon ears by the phonetic arrangement K’n-yan.
It is not surprising that this preliminary discourse did not go beyond the
merest essentials, but those essentials were highly important. Zamacona learned that the people
of K’n-yan were almost infinitely ancient, and that they had come from a distant part
of space where physical conditions are much like those of the earth. All this, of course, was
legend now; and one could not say how much truth was in it, or how much worship was really due
to the octopus-headed being Tulu who had traditionally brought them hither and whom they still
reverenced for aesthetic reasons. But they knew of the outer world, and were indeed the original
stock who had peopled it as soon as its crust was fit to live on. Between glacial ages they
had had some remarkable surface civilisations, especially one at the South Pole near the mountain
Kadath.
At some time infinitely in the past most of the outer world had sunk beneath
the ocean, so that only a few refugees remained to bear the news to K’n-yan. This was
undoubtedly due to the wrath of space-devils hostile alike to men and to men’s gods—for
it bore out rumours of a primordially earlier sinking which had submerged the gods themselves,
including great Tulu, who still lay prisoned and dreaming in the watery vaults of the half-cosmic
city Relex. No man not a slave of the space-devils, it was argued, could live long on the outer
earth; and it was decided that all beings who remained there must be evilly connected. Accordingly
traffic with the lands of sun and starlight abruptly ceased. The subterraneous approaches to
K’n-yan, or such as could be remembered, were either blocked up or carefully guarded;
and all encroachers were treated as dangerous spies and enemies.
But this was long ago. With the passing of ages fewer and fewer visitors came
to K’n-yan, and eventually sentries ceased to be maintained at the unblocked approaches.
The mass of the people forgot, except through distorted memories and myths and some very singular
dreams, that an outer world existed; though educated folk never ceased to recall the essential
facts. The last visitors ever recorded—centuries in the past—had not even been treated
as devil-spies; faith in the old legendry having long before died out. They had been questioned
eagerly about the fabulous outer regions; for scientific curiosity in K’n-yan was keen,
and the myths, memories, dreams, and historical fragments relating to the earth’s surface
had often tempted scholars to the brink of an external expedition which they had not quite dared
to attempt. The only thing demanded of such visitors was that they refrain from going back and
informing the outer world of K’n-yan’s positive existence; for after all, one could
not be sure about these outer lands. They coveted gold and silver, and might prove highly troublesome
intruders. Those who had obeyed the injunction had lived happily, though regrettably briefly,
and had told all they could about their world—little enough, however, since their accounts
were all so fragmentary and conflicting that one could hardly tell what to believe and what
to doubt. One wished that more of them would come. As for those who disobeyed and tried to escape—it
was very unfortunate about them. Zamacona himself was very welcome, for he appeared to be a
higher-grade man, and to know much more about the outer world, than anyone else who had come
down within memory. He could tell them much—and they hoped he would be reconciled to his
life-long stay.
Many things which Zamacona learned about K’n-yan in that first colloquy
left him quite breathless. He learned, for instance, that during the past few thousand years
the phenomena of old age and death had been conquered; so that men no longer grew feeble or
died except through violence or will. By regulating the system, one might be as physiologically
young and immortal as he wished; and the only reason why any allowed themselves to age, was
that they enjoyed the sensation in a world where stagnation and commonplaceness reigned. They
could easily become young again when they felt like it. Births had ceased, except for experimental
purposes, since a large population had been found needless by a master-race which controlled
Nature and organic rivals alike. Many, however, chose to die after a while; since despite the
cleverest efforts to invent new pleasures, the ordeal of consciousness became too dull for sensitive
souls—especially those in whom time and satiation had blinded the primal instincts and
emotions of self-preservation. All the members of the group before Zamacona were from 500 to
1500 years old; and several had seen surface visitors before, though time had blurred the recollection.
These visitors, by the way, had often tried to duplicate the longevity of the underground race;
but had been able to do so only fractionally, owing to evolutionary differences developing during
the million or two years of cleavage.
These evolutionary differences were even more strikingly shewn in another particular—one
far stranger than the wonder of immortality itself. This was the ability of the people of K’n-yan
to regulate the balance between matter and abstract energy, even where the bodies of living
organic beings were concerned, by the sheer force of the technically trained will. In other
words, with suitable effort a learned man of K’n-yan could dematerialise and rematerialise
himself—or, with somewhat greater effort and subtler technique, any other object he chose;
reducing solid matter to free external particles and recombining the particles again without
damage. Had not Zamacona answered his visitors’ knock when he did, he would have discovered
this accomplishment in a highly puzzling way; for only the strain and bother of the process
prevented the twenty men from passing bodily through the golden door without pausing for a summons.
This art was much older than the art of perpetual life; and it could be taught to some extent,
though never perfectly, to any intelligent person. Rumours of it had reached the outer world
in past aeons; surviving in secret traditions and ghostly legendry. The men of K’n-yan
had been amused by the primitive and imperfect spirit tales brought down by outer-world stragglers.
In practical life this principle had certain industrial applications, but was generally suffered
to remain neglected through lack of any particular incentive to its use. Its chief surviving
form was in connexion with sleep, when for excitement’s sake many dream-connoisseurs resorted
to it to enhance the vividness of their visionary wanderings. By the aid of this method certain
dreamers even paid half-material visits to a strange, nebulous realm of mounds and valleys and
varying light which some believed to be the forgotten outer world. They would go thither on
their beasts, and in an age of peace live over the old, glorious battles of their forefathers.
Some philosophers thought that in such cases they actually coalesced with immaterial forces
left behind by these warlike ancestors themselves.
The people of K’n-yan all dwelt in the great, tall city of Tsath beyond
the mountains. Formerly several races of them had inhabited the entire underground world, which
stretched down to unfathomable abysses and which included besides the blue-litten region a red-litten
region called Yoth, where relics of a still older and non-human race were found by archaeologists.
In the course of time, however, the men of Tsath had conquered and enslaved the rest; interbreeding
them with certain horned and four-footed animals of the red-litten region, whose semi-human
leanings were very peculiar, and which, though containing a certain artificially created element,
may have been in part the degenerate descendants of those peculiar entities who had left the
relics. As aeons passed, and mechanical discoveries made the business of life extremely easy,
a concentration of the people of Tsath took place; so that all the rest of K’n-yan became
relatively deserted.
It was easier to live in one place, and there was no object in maintaining
a population of overflowing proportions. Many of the old mechanical devices were still in use,
though others had been abandoned when it was seen that they failed to give pleasure, or that
they were not necessary for a race of reduced numbers whose mental force could govern an extensive
array of inferior and semi-human industrial organisms. This extensive slave-class was highly
composite, being bred from ancient conquered enemies, from outer-world stragglers, from dead
bodies curiously galvanised into effectiveness, and from the naturally inferior members of the
ruling race of Tsath. The ruling type itself had become highly superior through selective breeding
and social evolution—the nation having passed through a period of idealistic industrial
democracy which gave equal opportunities to all, and thus, by raising the naturally intelligent
to power, drained the masses of all their brains and stamina. Industry, being found fundamentally
futile except for the supplying of basic needs and the gratification of inescapable yearnings,
had become very simple. Physical comfort was ensured by an urban mechanisation of standardised
and easily maintained pattern, and other elemental needs were supplied by scientific agriculture
and stock-raising. Long travel was abandoned, and people went back to using the horned, half-human
beasts instead of maintaining the profusion of gold, silver, and steel transportation machines
which had once threaded land, water, and air. Zamacona could scarcely believe that such things
had ever existed outside dreams, but was told he could see specimens of them in museums. He
could also see the ruins of other vast magical devices by travelling a day’s journey to
the valley of Do-Hna, to which the race had spread during its period of greatest numbers. The
cities and temples of this present plain were of a far more archaic period, and had never been
other than religious and antiquarian shrines during the supremacy of the men of Tsath.
In government, Tsath was a kind of communistic or semi-anarchical state; habit
rather than law determining the daily order of things. This was made possible by the age-old
experience and paralysing ennui of the race, whose wants and needs were limited to physical
fundamentals and to new sensations. An aeon-long tolerance not yet undermined by growing reaction
had abolished all illusions of values and principles, and nothing but an approximation to custom
was ever sought or expected. To see that the mutual encroachments of pleasure-seeking never
crippled the mass life of the community—this was all that was desired. Family organisation
had long ago perished, and the civil and social distinction of the sexes had disappeared. Daily
life was organised in ceremonial patterns; with games, intoxication, torture of slaves, day-dreaming,
gastronomic and emotional orgies, religious exercises, exotic experiments, artistic and philosophical
discussions, and the like, as the principal occupations. Property—chiefly land, slaves,
animals, shares in the common city enterprise of Tsath, and ingots of magnetic Tulu-metal, the
former universal money standard—was allocated on a very complex basis which included a
certain amount equally divided among all the freemen. Poverty was unknown, and labour consisted
only of certain administrative duties imposed by an intricate system of testing and selection.
Zamacona found difficulty in describing conditions so unlike anything he had previously known;
and the text of his manuscript proved unusually puzzling at this point.
Art and intellect, it appeared, had reached very high levels in Tsath; but
had become listless and decadent. The dominance of machinery had at one time broken up the growth
of normal aesthetics, introducing a lifelessly geometrical tradition fatal to sound expression.
This had soon been outgrown, but had left its mark upon all pictorial and decorative attempts;
so that except for conventionalised religious designs, there was little depth or feeling in
any later work. Archaistic reproductions of earlier work had been found much preferable for
general enjoyment. Literature was all highly individual and analytical, so much so as to be
wholly incomprehensible to Zamacona. Science had been profound and accurate, and all-embracing
save in the one direction of astronomy. Of late, however, it was falling into decay, as people
found it increasingly useless to tax their minds by recalling its maddening infinitude of details
and ramifications. It was thought more sensible to abandon the deepest speculations and to confine
philosophy to conventional forms. Technology, of course, could be carried on by rule of thumb.
History was more and more neglected, but exact and copious chronicles of the past existed in
the libraries. It was still an interesting subject, and there would be a vast number to rejoice
at the fresh outer-world knowledge brought in by Zamacona. In general, though, the modern tendency
was to feel rather than to think; so that men were now more highly esteemed for inventing new
diversions than for preserving old facts or pushing back the frontier of cosmic mystery.
Religion was a leading interest in Tsath, though very few actually believed
in the supernatural. What was desired was the aesthetic and emotional exaltation bred by the
mystical moods and sensuous rites which attended the colourful ancestral faith. Temples to Great
Tulu, a spirit of universal harmony anciently symbolised as the octopus-headed god who had brought
all men down from the stars, were the most richly constructed objects in all K’n-yan;
while the cryptic shrines of Yig, the principle of life symbolised as the Father of all Serpents,
were almost as lavish and remarkable. In time Zamacona learned much of the orgies and sacrifices
connected with this religion, but seemed piously reluctant to describe them in his manuscript.
He himself never participated in any of the rites save those which he mistook for perversions
of his own faith; nor did he ever lose an opportunity to try to convert the people to that faith
of the Cross which the Spaniards hoped to make universal.
Prominent in the contemporary religion of Tsath was a revived and almost genuine
veneration for the rare, sacred metal of Tulu—that dark, lustrous, magnetic stuff which was
nowhere found in Nature, but which had always been with men in the form of idols and hieratic
implements. From the earliest times any sight of it in its unalloyed form had impelled respect,
while all the sacred archives and litanies were kept in cylinders wrought of its purest substance.
Now, as the neglect of science and intellect was dulling the critically analytical spirit, people
were beginning to weave around the metal once more that same fabric of awestruck superstition
which had existed in primitive times.
Another function of religion was the regulation of the calendar, born of a
period when time and speed were regarded as prime fetiches in man’s emotional life. Periods
of alternate waking and sleeping, prolonged, abridged, and inverted as mood and convenience
dictated, and timed by the tail-beats of Great Yig, the Serpent, corresponded very roughly to
terrestrial days and nights; though Zamacona’s sensations told him they must actually
be almost twice as long. The year-unit, measured by Yig’s annual shedding of his skin,
was equal to about a year and a half of the outer world. Zamacona thought he had mastered this
calendar very well when he wrote his manuscript, whence the confidently given date of 1545;
but the document failed to suggest that his assurance in this matter was fully justified.
As the spokesman of the Tsath party proceeded with his information, Zamacona
felt a growing repulsion and alarm. It was not only what was told, but the strange, telepathic
manner of telling, and the plain inference that return to the outer world would be impossible,
that made the Spaniard wish he had never descended to this region of magic, abnormality, and
decadence. But he knew that nothing but friendly acquiescence would do as a policy, hence decided
to coöperate in all his visitors’ plans and furnish all the information they might
desire. They, on their part, were fascinated by the outer-world data which he managed haltingly
to convey.
It was really the first draught of reliable surface information they had had
since the refugees straggled back from Atlantis and Lemuria aeons before, for all their subsequent
emissaries from outside had been members of narrow and local groups without any knowledge of
the world at large—Mayas, Toltecs, and Aztecs at best, and mostly ignorant tribes of the
plains. Zamacona was the first European they had ever seen, and the fact that he was a youth
of education and brilliancy made him of still more emphatic value as a source of knowledge.
The visiting party shewed their breathless interest in all he contrived to convey, and it was
plain that his coming would do much to relieve the flagging interest of weary Tsath in matters
of geography and history.
The only thing which seemed to displease the men of Tsath was the fact that
curious and adventurous strangers were beginning to pour into those parts of the upper world
where the passages to K’n-yan lay. Zamacona told them of the founding of Florida and New
Spain, and made it clear that a great part of the world was stirring with the zest of adventure—Spanish,
Portuguese, French, and English. Sooner or later Mexico and Florida must meet in one great colonial
empire—and then it would be hard to keep outsiders from the rumoured gold and silver of
the abyss. Charging Buffalo knew of Zamacona’s journey into the earth. Would he tell Coronado,
or somehow let a report get to the great viceroy, when he failed to find the traveller at the
promised meeting-place? Alarm for the continued secrecy and safety of K’n-yan shewed in
the faces of the visitors, and Zamacona absorbed from their minds the fact that from now on
sentries would undoubtedly be posted once more at all the unblocked passages to the outside
world which the men of Tsath could remember.
V.

The long conversation of Zamacona and his visitors took place in the green-blue
twilight of the grove just outside the temple door. Some of the men reclined on the weeds and
moss beside the half-vanished walk, while others, including the Spaniard and the chief spokesman
of the Tsath party, sat on the occasional low monolithic pillars that lined the temple approach.
Almost a whole terrestrial day must have been consumed in the colloquy, for Zamacona felt the
need of food several times, and ate from his well-stocked pack while some of the Tsath party
went back for provisions to the roadway, where they had left the animals on which they had ridden.
At length the prime leader of the party brought the discourse to a close, and indicated that
the time had come to proceed to the city.
There were, he affirmed, several extra beasts in the cavalcade, upon one of
which Zamacona could ride. The prospect of mounting one of those ominous hybrid entities whose
fabled nourishment was so alarming, and a single sight of which had set Charging Buffalo into
such a frenzy of flight, was by no means reassuring to the traveller. There was, moreover, another
point about the things which disturbed him greatly—the apparently preternatural intelligence
with which some members of the previous day’s roving pack had reported his presence to
the men of Tsath and brought out the present expedition. But Zamacona was not a coward, hence
followed the men boldly down the weed-grown walk toward the road where the things were stationed.
And yet he could not refrain from crying out in terror at what he saw when
he passed through the great vine-draped pylons and emerged upon the ancient road. He did not
wonder that the curious Wichita had fled in panic, and had to close his eyes a moment to retain
his sanity. It is unfortunate that some sense of pious reticence prevented him from describing
fully in his manuscript the nameless sight he saw. As it is, he merely hinted at the shocking
morbidity of these great floundering white things, with black fur on their backs, a rudimentary
horn in the centre of their foreheads, and an unmistakable trace of human or anthropoid blood
in their flat-nosed, bulging-lipped faces. They were, he declared later in his manuscript, the
most terrible objective entities he ever saw in his life, either in K’n-yan or in the
outer world. And the specific quality of their supreme terror was something apart from any easily
recognisable or describable feature. The main trouble was that they were not wholly products
of Nature.
The party observed Zamacona’s fright, and hastened to reassure him as
much as possible. The beasts or gyaa-yothn, they explained, surely were curious things;
but were really very harmless. The flesh they ate was not that of intelligent people of the
master-race, but merely that of a special slave-class which had for the most part ceased to
be thoroughly human, and which indeed was the principal meat stock of K’n-yan. They—or
their principal ancestral element—had first been found in a wild state amidst the Cyclopean
ruins of the deserted red-litten world of Yoth which lay below the blue-litten world of K’n-yan.
That part of them was human, seemed quite clear; but men of science could never decide whether
they were actually the descendants of the bygone entities who had lived and reigned in the strange
ruins. The chief ground for such a supposition was the well-known fact that the vanished inhabitants
of Yoth had been quadrupedal. This much was known from the very few manuscripts and carvings
found in the vaults of Zin, beneath the largest ruined city of Yoth. But it was also known from
these manuscripts that the beings of Yoth had possessed the art of synthetically creating life,
and had made and destroyed several efficiently designed races of industrial and transportational
animals in the course of their history—to say nothing of concocting all manner of fantastic
living shapes for the sake of amusement and new sensations during the long period of decadence.
The beings of Yoth had undoubtedly been reptilian in affiliations, and most physiologists of
Tsath agreed that the present beasts had been very much inclined toward reptilianism before
they had been crossed with the mammal slave-class of K’n-yan.
It argues well for the intrepid fire of those Renaissance Spaniards who conquered
half the unknown world, that Pánfilo de Zamacona y Nuñez actually mounted one
of the morbid beasts of Tsath and fell into place beside the leader of the cavalcade—the
man named Gll’-Hthaa-Ynn, who had been most active in the previous exchange of information.
It was a repulsive business; but after all, the seat was very easy, and the gait of the clumsy
gyaa-yoth surprisingly even and regular. No saddle was necessary, and the animal appeared
to require no guidance whatever. The procession moved forward at a brisk gait, stopping only
at certain abandoned cities and temples about which Zamacona was curious, and which Gll’-Hthaa-Ynn
was obligingly ready to display and explain. The largest of these towns, B’graa, was a
marvel of finely wrought gold, and Zamacona studied the curiously ornate architecture with avid
interest. Buildings tended toward height and slenderness, with roofs bursting into a multitude
of pinnacles. The streets were narrow, curving, and occasionally picturesquely hilly, but Gll’-Hthaa-Ynn
said that the later cities of K’n-yan were far more spacious and regular in design. All
these old cities of the plain shewed traces of levelled walls—reminders of the archaic
days when they had been successively conquered by the now dispersed armies of Tsath.
There was one object along the route which Gll’-Hthaa-Ynn exhibited on
his own initiative, even though it involved a detour of about a mile along a vine-tangled side
path. This was a squat, plain temple of black basalt blocks without a single carving, and containing
only a vacant onyx pedestal. The remarkable thing about it was its story, for it was a link
with a fabled elder world compared to which even cryptic Yoth was a thing of yesterday. It had
been built in imitation of certain temples depicted in the vaults of Zin, to house a very terrible
black toad-idol found in the red-litten world and called Tsathoggua in the Yothic manuscripts.
It had been a potent and widely worshipped god, and after its adoption by the people of K’n-yan
had lent its name to the city which was later to become dominant in that region. Yothic legend
said that it had come from a mysterious inner realm beneath the red-litten world—a black
realm of peculiar-sensed beings which had no light at all, but which had had great civilisations
and mighty gods before ever the reptilian quadrupeds of Yoth had come into being. Many images
of Tsathoggua existed in Yoth, all of which were alleged to have come from the black inner realm,
and which were supposed by Yothic archaeologists to represent the aeon-extinct race of that
realm. The black realm called N’kai in the Yothic manuscripts had been explored as thoroughly
as possible by these archaeologists, and singular stone troughs or burrows had excited infinite
speculation.
When the men of K’n-yan discovered the red-litten world and deciphered
its strange manuscripts, they took over the Tsathoggua cult and brought all the frightful toad
images up to the land of blue light—housing them in shrines of Yoth-quarried basalt like
the one Zamacona now saw. The cult flourished until it almost rivalled the ancient cults of
Yig and Tulu, and one branch of the race even took it to the outer world, where the smallest
of the images eventually found a shrine at Olathoë, in the land of Lomar near the earth’s
north pole. It was rumoured that this outer-world cult survived even after the great ice-sheet
and the hairy Gnophkehs destroyed Lomar, but of such matters not much was definitely known in
K’n-yan. In that world of blue light the cult came to an abrupt end, even though the name
of Tsath was suffered to remain.
What ended the cult was the partial exploration of the black realm of N’kai
beneath the red-litten world of Yoth. According to the Yothic manuscripts, there was no surviving
life in N’kai, but something must have happened in the aeons between the days of Yoth
and the coming of men to the earth; something perhaps not unconnected with the end of Yoth.
Probably it had been an earthquake, opening up lower chambers of the lightless world which had
been closed against the Yothic archaeologists; or perhaps some more frightful juxtaposition
of energy and electrons, wholly inconceivable to any sort of vertebrate minds, had taken place.
At any rate, when the men of K’n-yan went down into N’kai’s black abyss with
their great atom-power searchlights they found living things—living things that oozed
along stone channels and worshipped onyx and basalt images of Tsathoggua. But they were not
toads like Tsathoggua himself. Far worse—they were amorphous lumps of viscous black slime
that took temporary shapes for various purposes. The explorers of K’n-yan did not pause
for detailed observations, and those who escaped alive sealed the passage leading from red-litten
Yoth down into the gulfs of nether horror. Then all the images of Tsathoggua in the land of
K’n-yan were dissolved into the ether by disintegrating rays, and the cult was abolished
forever.
Aeons later, when naive fears were outgrown and supplanted by scientific curiosity,
the old legends of Tsathoggua and N’kai were recalled, and a suitably armed and equipped
exploring party went down to Yoth to find the closed gate of the black abyss and see what might
still lie beneath. But they could not find the gate, nor could any man ever do so in all the
ages that followed. Nowadays there were those who doubted that any abyss had ever existed, but
the few scholars who could still decipher the Yothic manuscripts believed that the evidence
for such a thing was adequate, even though the middle records of K’n-yan, with accounts
of the one frightful expedition into N’kai, were more open to question. Some of the later
religious cults tried to suppress remembrance of N’kai’s existence, and attached
severe penalties to its mention; but these had not begun to be taken seriously at the time of
Zamacona’s advent to K’n-yan.
As the cavalcade returned to the old highway and approached the low range of
mountains, Zamacona saw that the river was very close on the left. Somewhat later, as the terrain
rose, the stream entered a gorge and passed through the hills, while the road traversed the
gap at a rather higher level close to the brink. It was about this time that light rainfall
came. Zamacona noticed the occasional drops and drizzle, and looked up at the coruscating blue
air, but there was no diminution of the strange radiance. Gll’-Hthaa-Ynn then told him
that such condensations and precipitations of water-vapour were not uncommon, and that they
never dimmed the glare of the vault above. A kind of mist, indeed, always hung about the lowlands
of K’n-yan, and compensated for the complete absence of true clouds.
The slight rise of the mountain pass enabled Zamacona, by looking behind, to
see the ancient and deserted plain in panorama as he had seen it from the other side. He seems
to have appreciated its strange beauty, and to have vaguely regretted leaving it; for he speaks
of being urged by Gll’-Hthaa-Ynn to drive his beast more rapidly. When he faced frontward
again he saw that the crest of the road was very near; the weed-grown way leading starkly up
and ending against a blank void of blue light. The scene was undoubtedly highly impressive—a
steep green mountain wall on the right, a deep river-chasm on the left with another green mountain
wall beyond it, and ahead, the churning sea of bluish coruscations into which the upward path
dissolved. Then came the crest itself, and with it the world of Tsath outspread in a stupendous
forward vista.
Zamacona caught his breath at the great sweep of peopled landscape, for it
was a hive of settlement and activity beyond anything he had ever seen or dreamed of. The downward
slope of the hill itself was relatively thinly strown with small farms and occasional temples;
but beyond it lay an enormous plain covered like a chess board with planted trees, irrigated
by narrow canals cut from the river, and threaded by wide, geometrically precise roads of gold
or basalt blocks. Great silver cables borne aloft on golden pillars linked the low, spreading
buildings and clusters of buildings which rose here and there, and in some places one could
see lines of partly ruinous pillars without cables. Moving objects shewed the fields to be under
tillage, and in some cases Zamacona saw that men were ploughing with the aid of the repulsive,
half-human quadrupeds.
But most impressive of all was the bewildering vision of clustered spires and
pinnacles which rose afar off across the plain and shimmered flower-like and spectral in the
coruscating blue light. At first Zamacona thought it was a mountain covered with houses and
temples, like some of the picturesque hill cities of his own Spain, but a second glance shewed
him that it was not indeed such. It was a city of the plain, but fashioned of such heaven-reaching
towers that its outline was truly that of a mountain. Above it hung a curious greyish haze,
through which the blue light glistened and took added overtones of radiance from the million
golden minarets. Glancing at Gll’-Hthaa-Ynn, Zamacona knew that this was the monstrous,
gigantic, and omnipotent city of Tsath.
As the road turned downward toward the plain, Zamacona felt a kind of uneasiness
and sense of evil. He did not like the beast he rode, or the world that could provide such a
beast, and he did not like the atmosphere that brooded over the distant city of Tsath. When
the cavalcade began to pass occasional farms, the Spaniard noticed the forms that worked in
the fields; and did not like their motions and proportions, or the mutilations he saw on most
of them. Moreover, he did not like the way that some of these forms were herded in corrals,
or the way they grazed on the heavy verdure. Gll’-Hthaa-Ynn indicated that these beings
were members of the slave-class, and that their acts were controlled by the master of the farm,
who gave them hypnotic impressions in the morning of all they were to do during the day. As
semi-conscious machines, their industrial efficiency was nearly perfect. Those in the corrals
were inferior specimens, classified merely as livestock.
Upon reaching the plain, Zamacona saw the larger farms and noted the almost
human work performed by the repulsive horned gyaa-yothn. He likewise observed the more manlike
shapes that toiled along the furrows, and felt a curious fright and disgust toward certain of
them whose motions were more mechanical than those of the rest. These, Gll’-Hthaa-Ynn
explained, were what men called the y’m-bhi—organisms which had died, but
which had been mechanically reanimated for industrial purposes by means of atomic energy and
thought-power. The slave-class did not share the immortality of the freemen of Tsath, so that
with time the number of y’m-bhi had become very large. They were dog-like and faithful,
but not so readily amenable to thought-commands as were living slaves. Those which most repelled
Zamacona were those whose mutilations were greatest; for some were wholly headless, while others
had suffered singular and seemingly capricious subtractions, distortions, transpositions, and
graftings in various places. The Spaniard could not account for this condition, but Gll’-Hthaa-Ynn
made it clear that these were slaves who had been used for the amusement of the people in some
of the vast arenas; for the men of Tsath were connoisseurs of delicate sensation, and required
a constant supply of fresh and novel stimuli for their jaded impulses. Zamacona, though by no
means squeamish, was not favourably impressed by what he saw and heard.
Approached more closely, the vast metropolis became dimly horrible in its monstrous
extent and inhuman height. Gll’-Hthaa-Ynn explained that the upper parts of the great
towers were no longer used, and that many had been taken down to avoid the bother of maintenance.
The plain around the original urban area was covered with newer and smaller dwellings, which
in many cases were preferred to the ancient towers. From the whole mass of gold and stone a
monotonous roar of activity droned outward over the plain, while cavalcades and streams of wagons
were constantly entering and leaving over the great gold- or stone-paved roads.
Several times Gll’-Hthaa-Ynn paused to shew Zamacona some particular
object of interest, especially the temples of Yig, Tulu, Nug, Yeb, and the Not-to-Be-Named One
which lined the road at infrequent intervals, each in its embowering grove according to the
custom of K’n-yan. These temples, unlike those of the deserted plain beyond the mountains,
were still in active use; large parties of mounted worshippers coming and going in constant
streams. Gll’-Hthaa-Ynn took Zamacona into each of them, and the Spaniard watched the
subtle orgiastic rites with fascination and repulsion. The ceremonies of Nug and Yeb sickened
him especially—so much, indeed, that he refrained from describing them in his manuscript.
One squat, black temple of Tsathoggua was encountered, but it had been turned into a shrine
of Shub-Niggurath, the All-Mother and wife of the Not-to-Be-Named One. This deity was a kind
of sophisticated Astarte, and her worship struck the pious Catholic as supremely obnoxious.
What he liked least of all were the emotional sounds emitted by the celebrants—jarring
sounds in a race that had ceased to use vocal speech for ordinary purposes.
Close to the compact outskirts of Tsath, and well within the shadow of its
terrifying towers, Gll’-Hthaa-Ynn pointed out a monstrous circular building before which
enormous crowds were lined up. This, he indicated, was one of the many amphitheatres where curious
sports and sensations were provided for the weary people of K’n-yan. He was about to pause
and usher Zamacona inside the vast curved facade, when the Spaniard, recalling the mutilated
forms he had seen in the fields, violently demurred. This was the first of those friendly clashes
of taste which were to convince the people of Tsath that their guest followed strange and narrow
standards.
Tsath itself was a network of strange and ancient streets; and despite a growing
sense of horror and alienage, Zamacona was enthralled by its intimations of mystery and cosmic
wonder. The dizzy giganticism of its overawing towers, the monstrous surge of teeming life through
its ornate avenues, the curious carvings on its doorways and windows, the odd vistas glimpsed
from balustraded plazas and tiers of titan terraces, and the enveloping grey haze which seemed
to press down on the gorge-like streets in low ceiling-fashion, all combined to produce such
a sense of adventurous expectancy as he had never known before. He was taken at once to a council
of executives which held forth in a gold-and-copper palace behind a gardened and fountained
park, and was for some time subjected to close, friendly questioning in a vaulted hall frescoed
with vertiginous arabesques. Much was expected of him, he could see, in the way of historical
information about the outside earth; but in return all the mysteries of K’n-yan would
be unveiled to him. The one great drawback was the inexorable ruling that he might never return
to the world of sun and stars and Spain which was his.
A daily programme was laid down for the visitor, with time apportioned judiciously
among several kinds of activities. There were to be conversations with persons of learning in
various places, and lessons in many branches of Tsathic lore. Liberal periods of research were
allowed for, and all the libraries of K’n-yan both secular and sacred were to be thrown
open to him as soon as he might master the written languages. Rites and spectacles were to be
attended—except when he might especially object—and much time would be left for
the enlightened pleasure-seeking and emotional titillation which formed the goal and nucleus
of daily life. A house in the suburbs or an apartment in the city would be assigned him, and
he would be initiated into one of the large affection-groups, including many noblewomen of the
most extreme and art-enhanced beauty, which in latter-day K’n-yan took the place of family
units. Several horned gyaa-yothn would be provided for his transportation and errand-running,
and ten living slaves of intact body would serve to conduct his establishment and protect him
from thieves and sadists and religious orgiasts on the public highways. There were many mechanical
devices which he must learn to use, but Gll’-Hthaa-Ynn would instruct him immediately
regarding the principal ones.
Upon his choosing an apartment in preference to a suburban villa, Zamacona
was dismissed by the executives with great courtesy and ceremony, and was led through several
gorgeous streets to a cliff-like carven structure of some seventy or eighty floors. Preparations
for his arrival had already been instituted, and in a spacious ground-floor suite of vaulted
rooms slaves were busy adjusting hangings and furniture. There were lacquered and inlaid tabourets,
velvet and silk reclining-corners and squatting-cushions, and infinite rows of teakwood and
ebony pigeon-holes with metal cylinders containing some of the manuscripts he was soon to read—standard
classics which all urban apartments possessed. Desks with great stacks of membrane-paper and
pots of the prevailing green pigment were in every room—each with graded sets of pigment
brushes and other odd bits of stationery. Mechanical writing devices stood on ornate golden
tripods, while over all was shed a brilliant blue light from energy-globes set in the ceiling.
There were windows, but at this shadowy ground-level they were of scant illuminating value.
In some of the rooms were elaborate baths, while the kitchen was a maze of technical contrivances.
Supplies were brought, Zamacona was told, through the network of underground passages which
lay beneath Tsath, and which had once accommodated curious mechanical transports. There was
a stable on that underground level for the beasts, and Zamacona would presently be shewn how
to find the nearest runway to the street. Before his inspection was finished, the permanent
staff of slaves arrived and were introduced; and shortly afterward there came some half-dozen
freemen and noblewomen of his future affection-group, who were to be his companions for several
days, contributing what they could to his instruction and amusement. Upon their departure, another
party would take their place, and so onward in rotation through a group of about fifty members.
VI.

Thus was Pánfilo de Zamacona y Nuñez absorbed for four years
into the life of the sinister city of Tsath in the blue-litten nether world of K’n-yan.
All that he learned and saw and did is clearly not told in his manuscript; for a pious reticence
overcame him when he began to write in his native Spanish tongue, and he dared not set down
everything. Much he consistently viewed with repulsion, and many things he steadfastly refrained
from seeing or doing or eating. For other things he atoned by frequent countings of the beads
of his rosary. He explored the entire world of K’n-yan, including the deserted machine-cities
of the middle period on the gorse-grown plain of Nith, and made one descent into the red-litten
world of Yoth to see the Cyclopean ruins. He witnessed prodigies of craft and machinery which
left him breathless, and beheld human metamorphoses, dematerialisations, rematerialisations,
and reanimations which made him cross himself again and again. His very capacity for astonishment
was blunted by the plethora of new marvels which every day brought him.
But the longer he stayed, the more he wished to leave, for the inner life of
K’n-yan was based on impulses very plainly outside his radius. As he progressed in historical
knowledge, he understood more; but understanding only heightened his distaste. He felt that
the people of Tsath were a lost and dangerous race—more dangerous to themselves than they
knew—and that their growing frenzy of monotony-warfare and novelty-quest was leading them
rapidly toward a precipice of disintegration and utter horror. His own visit, he could see,
had accelerated their unrest; not only by introducing fears of outside invasion, but by exciting
in many a wish to sally forth and taste the diverse external world he described. As time progressed,
he noticed an increasing tendency of the people to resort to dematerialisation as an amusement;
so that the apartments and amphitheatres of Tsath became a veritable Witches’ Sabbath
of transmutations, age-adjustments, death-experiments, and projections. With the growth of boredom
and restlessness, he saw, cruelty and subtlety and revolt were growing apace. There was more
and more cosmic abnormality, more and more curious sadism, more and more ignorance and superstition,
and more and more desire to escape out of physical life into a half-spectral state of electronic
dispersal.
All his efforts to leave, however, came to nothing. Persuasion was useless,
as repeated trials proved; though the mature disillusion of the upper classes at first prevented
them from resenting their guest’s open wish for departure. In a year which he reckoned
as 1543 Zamacona made an actual attempt to escape through the tunnel by which he had entered
K’n-yan, but after a weary journey across the deserted plain he encountered forces in
the dark passage which discouraged him from future attempts in that direction. As a means of
sustaining hope and keeping the image of home in mind, he began about this time to make rough
draughts of the manuscript relating his adventures; delighting in the loved, old Spanish words
and the familiar letters of the Roman alphabet. Somehow he fancied he might get the manuscript
to the outer world; and to make it convincing to his fellows he resolved to enclose it in one
of the Tulu-metal cylinders used for sacred archives. That alien, magnetic substance could not
but support the incredible story he had to tell.
But even as he planned, he had little real hope of ever establishing contact
with the earth’s surface. Every known gate, he knew, was guarded by persons or forces
that it were better not to oppose. His attempt at escape had not helped matters, for he could
now see a growing hostility to the outer world he represented. He hoped that no other European
would find his way in; for it was possible that later comers might not fare as well as he. He
himself had been a cherished fountain of data, and as such had enjoyed a privileged status.
Others, deemed less necessary, might receive rather different treatment. He even wondered what
would happen to him when the sages of Tsath considered him drained dry of fresh facts; and in
self-defence began to be more gradual in his talks on earth-lore, conveying whenever he could
the impression of vast knowledge held in reserve.
One other thing which endangered Zamacona’s status in Tsath was his persistent
curiosity regarding the ultimate abyss of N’kai, beneath red-litten Yoth, whose existence
the dominant religious cults of K’n-yan were more and more inclined to deny. When exploring
Yoth he had vainly tried to find the blocked-up entrance; and later on he experimented in the
arts of dematerialisation and projection, hoping that he might thereby be able to throw his
consciousness downward into the gulfs which his physical eyes could not discover. Though never
becoming truly proficient in these processes, he did manage to achieve a series of monstrous
and portentous dreams which he believed included some elements of actual projection into N’kai;
dreams which greatly shocked and perturbed the leaders of Yig and Tulu-worship when he related
them, and which he was advised by friends to conceal rather than exploit. In time those dreams
became very frequent and maddening; containing things which he dared not record in his main
manuscript, but of which he prepared a special record for the benefit of certain learned men
in Tsath.
It may have been unfortunate—or it may have been mercifully fortunate—that
Zamacona practiced so many reticences and reserved so many themes and descriptions for subsidiary
manuscripts. The main document leaves one to guess much about the detailed manners, customs,
thoughts, language, and history of K’n-yan, as well as to form any adequate picture of
the visual aspect and daily life of Tsath. One is left puzzled, too, about the real motivations
of the people; their strange passivity and craven unwarlikeness, and their almost cringing fear
of the outer world despite their possession of atomic and dematerialising powers which would
have made them unconquerable had they taken the trouble to organise armies as in the old days.
It is evident that K’n-yan was far along in its decadence—reacting with mixed apathy
and hysteria against the standardised and time-tabled life of stultifying regularity which machinery
had brought it during its middle period. Even the grotesque and repulsive customs and modes
of thought and feeling can be traced to this source; for in his historical research Zamacona
found evidence of bygone eras in which K’n-yan had held ideas much like those of the classic
and renaissance outer world, and had possessed a national character and art full of what Europeans
regard as dignity, kindness, and nobility.
The more Zamacona studied these things, the more apprehensive about the future
he became; because he saw that the omnipresent moral and intellectual disintegration was a tremendously
deep-seated and ominously accelerating movement. Even during his stay the signs of decay multiplied.
Rationalism degenerated more and more into fanatical and orgiastic superstition, centring in
a lavish adoration of the magnetic Tulu-metal, and tolerance steadily dissolved into a series
of frenzied hatreds, especially toward the outer world of which the scholars were learning so
much from him. At times he almost feared that the people might some day lose their age-long
apathy and brokenness and turn like desperate rats against the unknown lands above them, sweeping
all before them by virtue of their singular and still-remembered scientific powers. But for
the present they fought their boredom and sense of emptiness in other ways; multiplying their
hideous emotional outlets and increasing the mad grotesqueness and abnormality of their diversions.
The arenas of Tsath must have been accursed and unthinkable places—Zamacona never went near
them. And what they would be in another century, or even in another decade, he did not dare
to think. The pious Spaniard crossed himself and counted his beads more often than usual in
those days.
In the year 1545, as he reckoned it, Zamacona began what may well be accepted
as his final series of attempts to leave K’n-yan. His fresh opportunity came from an unexpected
source—a female of his affection-group who conceived for him a curious individual infatuation
based on some hereditary memory of the days of monogamous wedlock in Tsath. Over this female—a
noblewoman of moderate beauty and of at least average intelligence named T’la-yub—Zamacona
acquired the most extraordinary influence; finally inducing her to help him in an escape, under
the promise that he would let her accompany him. Chance proved a great factor in the course
of events, for T’la-yub came of a primordial family of gate-lords who had retained oral
traditions of at least one passage to the outer world which the mass of people had forgotten
even at the time of the great closing; a passage to a mound on the level plains of earth which
had, in consequence, never been sealed up or guarded. She explained that the primordial gate-lords
were not guards or sentries, but merely ceremonial and economic proprietors, half-feudal and
baronial in status, of an era preceding the severance of surface-relations. Her own family had
been so reduced at the time of the closing that their gate had been wholly overlooked; and they
had ever afterward preserved the secret of its existence as a sort of hereditary secret—a
source of pride, and of a sense of reserve power, to offset the feeling of vanished wealth and
influence which so constantly irritated them.
Zamacona, now working feverishly to get his manuscript into final form in case
anything should happen to him, decided to take with him on his outward journey only five beast-loads
of unalloyed gold in the form of the small ingots used for minor decorations—enough, he calculated,
to make him a personage of unlimited power in his own world. He had become somewhat hardened
to the sight of the monstrous gyaa-yothn during his four years of residence in Tsath,
hence did not shrink from using the creatures; yet he resolved to kill and bury them, and cache
the gold, as soon as he reached the outer world, since he knew that even a glimpse of one of
the things would drive any ordinary Indian mad. Later he could arrange for a suitable expedition
to transport the treasure to Mexico. T’la-yub he would perhaps allow to share his fortunes,
for she was by no means unattractive; though possibly he would arrange for her sojourn amongst
the plains Indians, since he was not overanxious to preserve links with the manner of life in
Tsath. For a wife, of course, he would choose a lady of Spain—or at worst, an Indian princess
of normal outer-world descent and a regular and approved past. But for the present T’la-yub
must be used as a guide. The manuscript he would carry on his own person, encased in a book-cylinder
of the sacred and magnetic Tulu-metal.
The expedition itself is described in the addendum to Zamacona’s manuscript,
written later, and in a hand shewing signs of nervous strain. It set out amidst the most careful
precautions, choosing a rest-period and proceeding as far as possible along the faintly lighted
passages beneath the city. Zamacona and T’la-yub, disguised in slaves’ garments,
bearing provision-knapsacks, and leading the five laden beasts on foot, were readily taken for
commonplace workers; and they clung as long as possible to the subterranean way—using
a long and little-frequented branch which had formerly conducted the mechanical transports to
the now ruined suburb of L’thaa. Amidst the ruins of L’thaa they came to the surface,
thereafter passing as rapidly as possible over the deserted, blue-litten plain of Nith toward
the Grh-yan range of low hills. There, amidst the tangled underbrush, T’la-yub found the
long disused and half-fabulous entrance to the forgotten tunnel; a thing she had seen but once
before—aeons in the past, when her father had taken her thither to shew her this monument to
their family pride. It was hard work getting the laden gyaa-yothn to scrape through the
obstructing vines and briers, and one of them displayed a rebelliousness destined to bear dire
consequences—bolting away from the party and loping back toward Tsath on its detestable pads,
golden burden and all.
It was nightmare work burrowing by the light of blue-ray torches upward, downward,
forward, and upward again through a dank, choked tunnel that no foot had trodden since ages
before the sinking of Atlantis; and at one point T’la-yub had to practice the fearsome
art of dematerialisation on herself, Zamacona, and the laden beasts in order to pass a point
wholly clogged by shifting earth-strata. It was a terrible experience for Zamacona; for although
he had often witnessed dematerialisation in others, and even practiced it himself to the extent
of dream-projection, he had never been fully subjected to it before. But T’la-yub was
skilled in the arts of K’n-yan, and accomplished the double metamorphosis in perfect safety.
Thereafter they resumed the hideous burrowing through stalactited crypts of
horror where monstrous carvings leered at every turn; alternately camping and advancing for
a period which Zamacona reckoned as about three days, but which was probably less. At last they
came to a very narrow place where the natural or only slightly hewn cave-walls gave place to
walls of wholly artificial masonry, carved into terrible bas-reliefs. These walls, after about
a mile of steep ascent, ended with a pair of vast niches, one on each side, in which monstrous,
nitre-encrusted images of Yig and Tulu squatted, glaring at each other across the passage as
they had glared since the earliest youth of the human world. At this point the passage opened
into a prodigious vaulted and circular chamber of human construction; wholly covered with horrible
carvings, and revealing at the farther end an arched passageway with the foot of a flight of
steps. T’la-yub knew from family tales that this must be very near the earth’s surface,
but she could not tell just how near. Here the party camped for what they meant to be their
last rest-period in the subterraneous world.
It must have been hours later that the clank of metal and the padding of beasts’
feet awakened Zamacona and T’la-yub. A bluish glare was spreading from the narrow passage
between the images of Yig and Tulu, and in an instant the truth was obvious. An alarm had been
given at Tsath—as was later revealed, by the returning gyaa-yoth which had rebelled at the brier-choked
tunnel-entrance—and a swift party of pursuers had come to arrest the fugitives. Resistance
was clearly useless, and none was offered. The party of twelve beast-riders proved studiously
polite, and the return commenced almost without a word or thought-message on either side.
It was an ominous and depressing journey, and the ordeal of dematerialisation
and rematerialisation at the choked place was all the more terrible because of the lack of that
hope and expectancy which had palliated the process on the outward trip. Zamacona heard his
captors discussing the imminent clearing of this choked place by intensive radiations, since
henceforward sentries must be maintained at the hitherto unknown outer portal. It would not
do to let outsiders get within the passage, for then any who might escape without due treatment
would have a hint of the vastness of the inner world and would perhaps be curious enough to
return in greater strength. As with the other passages since Zamacona’s coming, sentries
must be stationed all along, as far as the very outermost gate; sentries drawn from amongst
all the slaves, the dead-alive y’m-bhi, or the class of discredited freemen. With
the overrunning of the American plains by thousands of Europeans, as the Spaniard had predicted,
every passage was a potential source of danger; and must be rigorously guarded until the technologists
of Tsath could spare the energy to prepare an ultimate and entrance-hiding obliteration as they
had done for many passages in earlier and more vigorous times.
Zamacona and T’la-yub were tried before three gn’agn of
the supreme tribunal in the gold-and-copper palace behind the gardened and fountained park,
and the Spaniard was given his liberty because of the vital outer-world information he still
had to impart. He was told to return to his apartment and to his affection-group; taking up
his life as before, and continuing to meet deputations of scholars according to the latest schedule
he had been following. No restrictions would be imposed upon him so long as he might remain
peacefully in K’n-yan—but it was intimated that such leniency would not be repeated
after another attempt at escape. Zamacona had felt that there was an element of irony in the
parting words of the chief gn’ag—an assurance that all of his gyaa-yothn,
including the one which had rebelled, would be returned to him.
The fate of T’la-yub was less happy. There being no object in retaining
her, and her ancient Tsathic lineage giving her act a greater aspect of treason than Zamacona’s
had possessed, she was ordered to be delivered to the curious diversions of the amphitheatre;
and afterward, in a somewhat mutilated and half-dematerialised form, to be given the functions
of a y’m-bhi or animated corpse-slave and stationed among the sentries guarding
the passage whose existence she had betrayed. Zamacona soon heard, not without many pangs of
regret he could scarcely have anticipated, that poor T’la-yub had emerged from the arena
in a headless and otherwise incomplete state, and had been set as an outermost guard upon the
mound in which the passage had been found to terminate. She was, he was told, a night-sentinel,
whose automatic duty was to warn off all comers with a torch; sending down reports to a small
garrison of twelve dead slave y’m-bhi and six living but partly dematerialised
freemen in the vaulted, circular chamber if the approachers did not heed her warning. She worked,
he was told, in conjunction with a day-sentinel—a living freeman who chose this post in
preference to other forms of discipline for other offences against the state. Zamacona, of course,
had long known that most of the chief gate-sentries were such discredited freemen.
It was now made plain to him, though indirectly, that his own penalty for another
escape-attempt would be service as a gate-sentry—but in the form of a dead-alive y’m-bhi
slave, and after amphitheatre-treatment even more picturesque than that which T’la-yub
was reported to have undergone. It was intimated that he—or parts of him—would
be reanimated to guard some inner section of the passage; within sight of others, where his
abridged person might serve as a permanent symbol of the rewards of treason. But, his informants
always added, it was of course inconceivable that he would ever court such a fate. So long as
he remained peaceably in K’n-yan, he would continue to be a free, privileged, and respected
personage.
Yet in the end Pánfilo de Zamacona did court the fate so direfully hinted
to him. True, he did not really expect to encounter it; but the nervous latter part of his manuscript
makes it clear that he was prepared to face its possibility. What gave him a final hope of scatheless
escape from K’n-yan was his growing mastery of the art of dematerialisation. Having studied
it for years, and having learned still more from the two instances in which he had been subjected
to it, he now felt increasingly able to use it independently and effectively. The manuscript
records several notable experiments in this art—minor successes accomplished in his apartment—and
reflects Zamacona’s hope that he might soon be able to assume the spectral form in full,
attaining complete invisibility and preserving that condition as long as he wished.
Once he reached this stage, he argued, the outward way lay open to him. Of
course he could not bear away any gold, but mere escape was enough. He would, though, dematerialise
and carry away with him his manuscript in the Tulu-metal cylinder, even though it cost additional
effort; for this record and proof must reach the outer world at all hazards. He now knew the
passage to follow; and if he could thread it in an atom-scattered state, he did not see how
any person or force could detect or stop him. The only trouble would be if he failed to maintain
his spectral condition at all times. That was the one ever-present peril, as he had learned
from his experiments. But must one not always risk death and worse in a life of adventure? Zamacona
was a gentleman of Old Spain; of the blood that faced the unknown and carved out half the civilisation
of the New World.
For many nights after his ultimate resolution Zamacona prayed to St. Pamphilus
and other guardian saints, and counted the beads of his rosary. The last entry in the manuscript,
which toward the end took the form of a diary more and more, was merely a single sentence—“Es
más tarde de lo que pensaba—tengo que marcharme”. . . .
“It is later than I thought; I must go.” After that, only silence and conjecture—and
such evidence as the presence of the manuscript itself, and what that manuscript could lead
to, might provide.
VII.

When I looked up from my half-stupefied reading and note-taking the morning
sun was high in the heavens. The electric bulb was still burning, but such things of the real
world—the modern outer world—were far from my whirling brain. I knew I was in my
room at Clyde Compton’s at Binger—but upon what monstrous vista had I stumbled?
Was this thing a hoax or a chronicle of madness? If a hoax, was it a jest of the sixteenth century
or of today? The manuscript’s age looked appallingly genuine to my not wholly unpracticed
eyes, and the problem presented by the strange metal cylinder I dared not even think about.
Moreover, what a monstrously exact explanation it gave of all the baffling
phenomena of the mound—of the seemingly meaningless and paradoxical actions of diurnal
and nocturnal ghosts, and of the queer cases of madness and disappearance! It was even an accursedly
plausible explanation—evilly consistent—if one could adopt the incredible.
It must be a shocking hoax devised by someone who knew all the lore of the mound. There was
even a hint of social satire in the account of that unbelievable nether world of horror and
decay. Surely this was the clever forgery of some learned cynic—something like the leaden
crosses in New Mexico, which a jester once planted and pretended to discover as a relique of
some forgotten Dark Age colony from Europe.
Upon going down to breakfast I hardly knew what to tell Compton and his mother,
as well as the curious callers who had already begun to arrive. Still in a daze, I cut the Gordian
Knot by giving a few points from the notes I had made, and mumbling my belief that the thing
was a subtle and ingenious fraud left there by some previous explorer of the mound—a belief
in which everybody seemed to concur when told of the substance of the manuscript. It is curious
how all that breakfast group—and all the others in Binger to whom the discussion was repeated—seemed
to find a great clearing of the atmosphere in the notion that somebody was playing a joke on
somebody. For the time we all forgot that the known, recent history of the mound presented mysteries
as strange as any in the manuscript, and as far from acceptable solution as ever.
The fears and doubts began to return when I asked for volunteers to visit the
mound with me. I wanted a larger excavating party—but the idea of going to that uncomfortable
place seemed no more attractive to the people of Binger than it had seemed on the previous day.
I myself felt a mounting horror upon looking toward the mound and glimpsing the moving speck
which I knew was the daylight sentinel; for in spite of all my scepticism the morbidities of
that manuscript stuck by me and gave everything connected with the place a new and monstrous
significance. I absolutely lacked the resolution to look at the moving speck with my binoculars.
Instead, I set out with the kind of bravado we display in nightmares—when, knowing we
are dreaming, we plunge desperately into still thicker horrors, for the sake of having the whole
thing over the sooner. My pick and shovel were already out there, so I had only my handbag of
smaller paraphernalia to take. Into this I put the strange cylinder and its contents, feeling
vaguely that I might possibly find something worth checking up with some part of the green-lettered
Spanish text. Even a clever hoax might be founded on some actual attribute of the mound which
a former explorer had discovered—and that magnetic metal was damnably odd! Grey Eagle’s
cryptic talisman still hung from its leathern cord around my neck.
I did not look very sharply at the mound as I walked toward it, but when I
reached it there was nobody in sight. Repeating my upward scramble of the previous day, I was
troubled by thoughts of what might lie close at hand if, by any miracle, any part
of the manuscript were actually half-true. In such a case, I could not help reflecting,
the hypothetical Spaniard Zamacona must have barely reached the outer world when overtaken by
some disaster—perhaps an involuntary rematerialisation. He would naturally, in that event,
have been seized by whichever sentry happened to be on duty at the time—either the discredited
freeman, or, as a matter of supreme irony, the very T’la-yub who had planned and aided
his first attempt at escape—and in the ensuing struggle the cylinder with the manuscript
might well have been dropped on the mound’s summit, to be neglected and gradually buried
for nearly four centuries. But, I added, as I climbed over the crest, one must not think of
extravagant things like that. Still, if there were anything in the tale, it must have
been a monstrous fate to which Zamacona had been dragged back . . . the amphitheatre . . .
mutilation . . . duty somewhere in the dank, nitrous tunnel as a dead-alive slave . . .
a maimed corpse-fragment as an automatic interior sentry. . . .
It was a very real shock which chased this morbid speculation from my head,
for upon glancing around the elliptical summit I saw at once that my pick and shovel had been
stolen. This was a highly provoking and disconcerting development; baffling, too, in view of
the seeming reluctance of all the Binger folk to visit the mound. Was this reluctance a pretended
thing, and had the jokers of the village been chuckling over my coming discomfiture as they
solemnly saw me off ten minutes before? I took out my binoculars and scanned the gaping crowd
at the edge of the village. No—they did not seem to be looking for any comic climax; yet
was not the whole affair at bottom a colossal joke in which all the villagers and reservation
people were concerned—legends, manuscript, cylinder, and all? I thought of how I had seen
the sentry from a distance, and then found him unaccountably vanished; thought also of the conduct
of old Grey Eagle, of the speech and expressions of Compton and his mother, and of the unmistakable
fright of most of the Binger people. On the whole, it could not very well be a village-wide
joke. The fear and the problem were surely real, though obviously there were one or two jesting
daredevils in Binger who had stolen out to the mound and made off with the tools I had left.
Everything else on the mound was as I had left it—brush cut by my machete,
slight, bowl-like depression toward the north end, and the hole I had made with my trench-knife
in digging up the magnetism-revealed cylinder. Deeming it too great a concession to the unknown
jokers to return to Binger for another pick and shovel, I resolved to carry out my programme
as best I could with the machete and trench-knife in my handbag; so extracting these, I set
to work excavating the bowl-like depression which my eye had picked as the possible site of
a former entrance to the mound. As I proceeded, I felt again the suggestion of a sudden wind
blowing against me which I had noticed the day before—a suggestion which seemed stronger,
and still more reminiscent of unseen, formless, opposing hands laid on my wrists, as I cut deeper
and deeper through the root-tangled red soil and reached the exotic black loam beneath. The
talisman around my neck appeared to twitch oddly in the breeze—not in any one direction,
as when attracted by the buried cylinder, but vaguely and diffusely, in a manner wholly unaccountable.
Then, quite without warning, the black, root-woven earth beneath my feet began
to sink cracklingly, while I heard a faint sound of sifting, falling matter far below me. The
obstructing wind, or forces, or hands now seemed to be operating from the very seat of the sinking,
and I felt that they aided me by pushing as I leaped back out of the hole to avoid being involved
in any cave-in. Bending down over the brink and hacking at the mould-caked root-tangle with
my machete, I felt that they were against me again—but at no time were they strong enough
to stop my work. The more roots I severed, the more falling matter I heard below. Finally the
hole began to deepen of itself toward the centre, and I saw that the earth was sifting down
into some large cavity beneath, so as to leave a good-sized aperture when the roots that had
bound it were gone. A few more hacks of the machete did the trick, and with a parting cave-in
and uprush of curiously chill and alien air the last barrier gave way. Under the morning sun
yawned a huge opening at least three feet square, and shewing the top of a flight of stone steps
down which the loose earth of the collapse was still sliding. My quest had come to something
at last! With an elation of accomplishment almost overbalancing fear for the nonce, I replaced
the trench-knife and machete in my handbag, took out my powerful electric torch, and prepared
for a triumphant, lone, and utterly rash invasion of the fabulous nether world I had uncovered.
It was rather hard getting down the first few steps, both because of the fallen
earth which had choked them and because of a sinister up-pushing of a cold wind from below.
The talisman around my neck swayed curiously, and I began to regret the disappearing square
of daylight above me. The electric torch shewed dank, water-stained, and salt-encrusted walls
fashioned of huge basalt blocks, and now and then I thought I descried some trace of carving
beneath the nitrous deposits. I gripped my handbag more tightly, and was glad of the comforting
weight of the sheriff’s heavy revolver in my right-hand coat pocket. After a time the
passage began to wind this way and that, and the staircase became free from obstructions. Carvings
on the walls were now definitely traceable, and I shuddered when I saw how clearly the grotesque
figures resembled the monstrous bas-reliefs on the cylinder I had found. Winds and forces continued
to blow malevolently against me, and at one or two bends I half fancied the torch gave glimpses
of thin, transparent shapes not unlike the sentinel on the mound as my binoculars had shewed
him. When I reached this stage of visual chaos I stopped for a moment to get a grip on myself.
It would not do to let my nerves get the better of me at the very outset of what would surely
be a trying experience, and the most important archaeological feat of my career.
But I wished I had not stopped at just that place, for the act fixed my attention
on something profoundly disturbing. It was only a small object lying close to the wall on one
of the steps below me, but that object was such as to put my reason to a severe test, and bring
up a line of the most alarming speculations. That the opening above me had been closed against
all material forms for generations was utterly obvious from the growth of shrub-roots and accumulation
of drifting soil; yet the object before me was most distinctly not many generations old. For
it was an electric torch much like the one I now carried—warped and encrusted in the tomb-like
dampness, but none the less perfectly unmistakable. I descended a few steps and picked it up,
wiping off the evil deposits on my rough coat. One of the nickel bands bore an engraved name
and address, and I recognised it with a start the moment I made it out. It read “Jas.
C. Williams, 17 Trowbridge St., Cambridge, Mass.”—and I knew that it had belonged
to one of the two daring college instructors who had disappeared on June 28, 1915. Only thirteen
years ago, and yet I had just broken through the sod of centuries! How had the thing got there?
Another entrance—or was there something after all in this mad idea of dematerialisation
and rematerialisation?
Doubt and horror grew upon me as I wound still farther down the seemingly endless
staircase. Would the thing never stop? The carvings grew more and more distinct, and assumed
a narrative pictorial quality which brought me close to panic as I recognised many unmistakable
correspondences with the history of K’n-yan as sketched in the manuscript now resting
in my handbag. For the first time I began seriously to question the wisdom of my descent, and
to wonder whether I had not better return to the upper air before I came upon
something which would never let me return as a sane man. But I did not hesitate long, for as
a Virginian I felt the blood of ancestral fighters and gentlemen-adventurers pounding a protest
against retreat from any peril known or unknown.
My descent became swifter rather than slower, and I avoided studying the terrible
bas-reliefs and intaglios that had unnerved me. All at once I saw an arched opening ahead, and
realised that the prodigious staircase had ended at last. But with that realisation came horror
in mounting magnitude, for before me there yawned a vast vaulted crypt of all-too-familiar outline—a
great circular space answering in every least particular to the carving-lined chamber described
in the Zamacona manuscript.
It was indeed the place. There could be no mistake. And if any room for doubt
yet remained, that room was abolished by what I saw directly across the great vault. It was
a second arched opening, commencing a long, narrow passage and having at its mouth two huge
opposite niches bearing loathsome and titanic images of shockingly familiar pattern. There in
the dark unclean Yig and hideous Tulu squatted eternally, glaring at each other across the passage
as they had glared since the earliest youth of the human world.
From this point onward I ask no credence for what I tell—for what I 
think I saw. It is too utterly unnatural, too utterly monstrous and incredible, to be any
part of sane human experience or objective reality. My torch, though casting a powerful beam
ahead, naturally could not furnish any general illumination of the Cyclopean crypt; so I now
began moving it about to explore the giant walls little by little. As I did so, I saw to my
horror that the space was by no means vacant, but was instead littered with odd furniture and
utensils and heaps of packages which bespoke a populous recent occupancy—no nitrous reliques
of the past, but queerly shaped objects and supplies in modern, every-day use. As my torch rested
on each article or group of articles, however, the distinctness of the outlines soon began to
grow blurred; until in the end I could scarcely tell whether the things belonged to the realm
of matter or to the realm of spirit.
All this while the adverse winds blew against me with increasing fury, and
the unseen hands plucked malevolently at me and snatched at the strange magnetic talisman I
wore. Wild conceits surged through my mind. I thought of the manuscript and what it said about
the garrison stationed in this place—twelve dead slave y’m-bhi and six living
but partly dematerialised freemen—that was in 1545—three hundred and eighty-three years
ago. . . . What since then? Zamacona had predicted change . . . subtle disintegration . . .
more dematerialisation . . . weaker and weaker . . . was it Grey Eagle’s
talisman that held them at bay—their sacred Tulu-metal—and were they feebly trying to
pluck it off so that they might do to me what they had done to those who had come before? . . .
It occurred to me with shuddering force that I was building my speculations out of a full belief
in the Zamacona manuscript—this must not be—I must get a grip on myself—
But, curse it, every time I tried to get a grip I saw some fresh sight to shatter
my poise still further. This time, just as my will power was driving the half-seen paraphernalia
into obscurity, my glance and torch-beam had to light on two things of very different nature;
two things of the eminently real and sane world; yet they did more to unseat my shaky reason
than anything I had seen before—because I knew what they were, and knew how profoundly,
in the course of Nature, they ought not to be there. They were my own missing pick and shovel,
side by side, and leaning neatly against the blasphemously carved wall of that hellish crypt.
God in heaven—and I had babbled to myself about daring jokers from Binger!
That was the last straw. After that the cursed hypnotism of the manuscript
got at me, and I actually saw the half-transparent shapes of the things that were pushing
and plucking; pushing and plucking—those leprous palaeogean things with something of humanity
still clinging to them—the complete forms, and the forms that were morbidly and
perversely incomplete . . . all these, and hideous other entities—the
four-footed blasphemies with ape-like face and projecting horn . . . and not
a sound so far in all that nitrous hell of inner earth. . . .
Then there was a sound—a flopping; a padding; a dull, advancing
sound which heralded beyond question a being as structurally material as the pickaxe and the
shovel—something wholly unlike the shadow-shapes that ringed me in, yet equally remote
from any sort of life as life is understood on the earth’s wholesome surface. My shattered
brain tried to prepare me for what was coming, but could not frame any adequate image. I could
only say over and over again to myself, “It is of the abyss, but it is not dematerialised.”
The padding grew more distinct, and from the mechanical cast of the tread I knew it was a dead
thing that stalked in the darkness. Then—oh, God, I saw it in the full beam of my torch;
saw it framed like a sentinel in the narrow passage between the nightmare idols of the serpent
Yig and the octopus Tulu. . . .
Let me collect myself enough to hint at what I saw; to explain why I dropped
torch and handbag and fled empty-handed in the utter blackness, wrapped in a merciful unconsciousness
which did not wear off until the sun and the distant yelling and the shouting from the village
roused me as I lay gasping on the top of the accursed mound. I do not yet know what guided me
again to the earth’s surface. I only know that the watchers in Binger saw me stagger up
into sight three hours after I had vanished; saw me lurch up and fall flat on the ground as
if struck by a bullet. None of them dared to come out and help me; but they knew I must be in
a bad state, so tried to rouse me as best they could by yelling in chorus and firing off revolvers.
It worked in the end, and when I came to I almost rolled down the side of the
mound in my eagerness to get away from that black aperture which still yawned open. My torch
and tools, and the handbag with the manuscript, were all down there; but it is easy to see why
neither I nor anyone else ever went after them. When I staggered across the plain and into the
village I dared not tell what I had seen. I only muttered vague things about carvings and statues
and snakes and shaken nerves. And I did not faint again until somebody mentioned that the ghost-sentinel
had reappeared about the time I had staggered half way back to town. I left Binger that evening,
and have never been there since, though they tell me the ghosts still appear on the mound as
usual.
But I have resolved to hint here at last what I dared not hint to the people
of Binger on that terrible August afternoon. I don’t know yet just how I can go about
it—and if in the end you think my reticence strange, just remember that to imagine such
a horror is one thing, but to see it is another thing. I saw it. I think you’ll
recall my citing early in this tale the case of a bright young man named Heaton who went out
to that mound one day in 1891 and came back at night as the village idiot, babbling for eight
years about horrors and then dying in an epileptic fit. What he used to keep moaning was “That
white man—oh, my God, what they did to him. . . .”
Well, I saw the same thing that poor Heaton saw—and I saw it after reading
the manuscript, so I know more of its history than he did. That makes it worse—for I know
all that it implies; all that must be still brooding and festering and waiting down there.
I told you it had padded mechanically toward me out of the narrow passage and had stood sentry-like
at the entrance between the frightful eidola of Yig and Tulu. That was very natural and inevitable—because
the thing was a sentry. It had been made a sentry for punishment, and it was quite dead—besides
lacking head, arms, lower legs, and other customary parts of a human being. Yes—it had
been a very human being once; and what is more, it had been white. Very obviously, if
that manuscript was as true as I think it was, this being had been used for the diversions
of the amphitheatre before its life had become wholly extinct and supplanted by automatic
impulses controlled from outside.
On its white and only slightly hairy chest some letters had been gashed or

I.

Not many weeks ago, on a street corner in the village of Pascoag, Rhode Island, a tall, heavily
built, and wholesome-looking pedestrian furnished much speculation by a singular lapse of behaviour.
He had, it appears, been descending the hill by the road from Chepachet; and encountering the
compact section, had turned to his left into the main thoroughfare where several modest business
blocks convey a touch of the urban. At this point, without visible provocation, he committed
his astonishing lapse; staring queerly for a second at the tallest of the buildings before him,
and then, with a series of terrified, hysterical shrieks, breaking into a frantic run which
ended in a stumble and fall at the next crossing. Picked up and dusted off by ready hands, he
was found to be conscious, organically unhurt, and evidently cured of his sudden nervous attack.
He muttered some shamefaced explanations involving a strain he had undergone, and with downcast
glance turned back up the Chepachet road, trudging out of sight without once looking behind
him. It was a strange incident to befall so large, robust, normal-featured, and capable-looking
a man, and the strangeness was not lessened by the remarks of a bystander who had recognised
him as the boarder of a well-known dairyman on the outskirts of Chepachet.
He was, it developed, a New York police detective named Thomas F. Malone, now
on a long leave of absence under medical treatment after some disproportionately arduous work
on a gruesome local case which accident had made dramatic. There had been a collapse of several
old brick buildings during a raid in which he had shared, and something about the wholesale
loss of life, both of prisoners and of his companions, had peculiarly appalled him. As a result,
he had acquired an acute and anomalous horror of any buildings even remotely suggesting the
ones which had fallen in, so that in the end mental specialists forbade him the sight of such
things for an indefinite period. A police surgeon with relatives in Chepachet had put forward
that quaint hamlet of wooden colonial houses as an ideal spot for the psychological convalescence;
and thither the sufferer had gone, promising never to venture among the brick-lined streets
of larger villages till duly advised by the Woonsocket specialist with whom he was put in touch.
This walk to Pascoag for magazines had been a mistake, and the patient had paid in fright, bruises,
and humiliation for his disobedience.
So much the gossips of Chepachet and Pascoag knew; and so much, also, the most
learned specialists believed. But Malone had at first told the specialists much more, ceasing
only when he saw that utter incredulity was his portion. Thereafter he held his peace, protesting
not at all when it was generally agreed that the collapse of certain squalid brick houses in
the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, and the consequent death of many brave officers, had unseated
his nervous equilibrium. He had worked too hard, all said, in trying to clean up those nests
of disorder and violence; certain features were shocking enough, in all conscience, and the
unexpected tragedy was the last straw. This was a simple explanation which everyone could understand,
and because Malone was not a simple person he perceived that he had better let it suffice. To
hint to unimaginative people of a horror beyond all human conception—a horror of houses
and blocks and cities leprous and cancerous with evil dragged from elder worlds—would
be merely to invite a padded cell instead of restful rustication, and Malone was a man of sense
despite his mysticism. He had the Celt’s far vision of weird and hidden things, but the
logician’s quick eye for the outwardly unconvincing; an amalgam which had led him far
afield in the forty-two years of his life, and set him in strange places for a Dublin University
man born in a Georgian villa near Phoenix Park.
And now, as he reviewed the things he had seen and felt and apprehended, Malone
was content to keep unshared the secret of what could reduce a dauntless fighter to a quivering
neurotic; what could make old brick slums and seas of dark, subtle faces a thing of nightmare
and eldritch portent. It would not be the first time his sensations had been forced to bide
uninterpreted—for was not his very act of plunging into the polyglot abyss of New York’s
underworld a freak beyond sensible explanation? What could he tell the prosaic of the antique
witcheries and grotesque marvels discernible to sensitive eyes amidst the poison cauldron where
all the varied dregs of unwholesome ages mix their venom and perpetuate their obscene terrors?
He had seen the hellish green flame of secret wonder in this blatant, evasive welter of outward
greed and inward blasphemy, and had smiled gently when all the New-Yorkers he knew scoffed at
his experiment in police work. They had been very witty and cynical, deriding his fantastic
pursuit of unknowable mysteries and assuring him that in these days New York held nothing but
cheapness and vulgarity. One of them had wagered him a heavy sum that he could not—despite
many poignant things to his credit in the Dublin Review—even write a truly interesting
story of New York low life; and now, looking back, he perceived that cosmic irony had justified
the prophet’s words while secretly confuting their flippant meaning. The horror, as glimpsed
at last, could not make a story—for like the book cited by Poe’s German authority,
“es lässt sich nicht lesen—it does not permit itself to be read.”
II.

To Malone the sense of latent mystery in existence was always present. In youth he had felt
the hidden beauty and ecstasy of things, and had been a poet; but poverty and sorrow and exile
had turned his gaze in darker directions, and he had thrilled at the imputations of evil in
the world around. Daily life had for him come to be a phantasmagoria of macabre shadow-studies;
now glittering and leering with concealed rottenness as in Beardsley’s best manner, now
hinting terrors behind the commonest shapes and objects as in the subtler and less obvious work
of Gustave Doré. He would often regard it as merciful that most persons of high intelligence
jeer at the inmost mysteries; for, he argued, if superior minds were ever placed in fullest
contact with the secrets preserved by ancient and lowly cults, the resultant abnormalities would
soon not only wreck the world, but threaten the very integrity of the universe. All this reflection
was no doubt morbid, but keen logic and a deep sense of humour ably offset it. Malone was satisfied
to let his notions remain as half-spied and forbidden visions to be lightly played with; and
hysteria came only when duty flung him into a hell of revelation too sudden and insidious to
escape.
He had for some time been detailed to the Butler Street station in Brooklyn
when the Red Hook matter came to his notice. Red Hook is a maze of hybrid squalor near the ancient
waterfront opposite Governor’s Island, with dirty highways climbing the hill from the
wharves to that higher ground where the decayed lengths of Clinton and Court Streets lead off
toward the Borough Hall. Its houses are mostly of brick, dating from the first quarter to the
middle of the nineteenth century, and some of the obscurer alleys and byways have that alluring
antique flavour which conventional reading leads us to call “Dickensian”. The population
is a hopeless tangle and enigma; Syrian, Spanish, Italian, and negro elements impinging upon
one another, and fragments of Scandinavian and American belts lying not far distant. It is a
babel of sound and filth, and sends out strange cries to answer the lapping of oily waves at
its grimy piers and the monstrous organ litanies of the harbour whistles. Here long ago a brighter
picture dwelt, with clear-eyed mariners on the lower streets and homes of taste and substance
where the larger houses line the hill. One can trace the relics of this former happiness in
the trim shapes of the buildings, the occasional graceful churches, and the evidences of original
art and background in bits of detail here and there—a worn flight of steps, a battered
doorway, a wormy pair of decorative columns or pilasters, or a fragment of once green space
with bent and rusted iron railing. The houses are generally in solid blocks, and now and then
a many-windowed cupola arises to tell of days when the households of captains and ship-owners
watched the sea.
From this tangle of material and spiritual putrescence the blasphemies of an
hundred dialects assail the sky. Hordes of prowlers reel shouting and singing along the lanes
and thoroughfares, occasional furtive hands suddenly extinguish lights and pull down curtains,
and swarthy, sin-pitted faces disappear from windows when visitors pick their way through. Policemen
despair of order or reform, and seek rather to erect barriers protecting the outside world from
the contagion. The clang of the patrol is answered by a kind of spectral silence, and such prisoners
as are taken are never communicative. Visible offences are as varied as the local dialects,
and run the gamut from the smuggling of rum and prohibited aliens through diverse stages of
lawlessness and obscure vice to murder and mutilation in their most abhorrent guises. That these
visible affairs are not more frequent is not to the neighbourhood’s credit, unless the
power of concealment be an art demanding credit. More people enter Red Hook than leave it—or
at least, than leave it by the landward side—and those who are not loquacious are the
likeliest to leave.
Malone found in this state of things a faint stench of secrets more terrible than
any of the sins denounced by citizens and bemoaned by priests and philanthropists. He was
conscious, as one who united imagination with scientific knowledge, that modern people under
lawless conditions tend uncannily to repeat the darkest instinctive patterns of primitive half-ape
savagery in their daily life and ritual observances; and he had often viewed with an
anthropologist’s shudder the chanting, cursing processions of blear-eyed and pockmarked young
men which wound their way along in the dark small hours of morning. One saw groups of these youths
incessantly; sometimes in leering vigils on street corners, sometimes in doorways playing eerily on
cheap instruments of music, sometimes in stupefied dozes or indecent dialogues around cafeteria
tables near Borough Hall, and sometimes in whispering converse around dingy taxicabs drawn up at
the high stoops of crumbling and closely shuttered old houses. They chilled and fascinated him more
than he dared confess to his associates on the force, for he seemed to see in them some monstrous
thread of secret continuity; some fiendish, cryptical, and ancient pattern utterly beyond and
below the sordid mass of facts and habits and haunts listed with such conscientious technical
care by the police. They must be, he felt inwardly, the heirs of some shocking and primordial
tradition; the sharers of debased and broken scraps from cults and ceremonies older than mankind.
Their coherence and definiteness suggested it, and it shewed in the singular suspicion of order
which lurked beneath their squalid disorder. He had not read in vain such treatises as Miss
Murray’s Witch-Cult in Western Europe; and knew that up to recent years there had
certainly survived among peasants and furtive folk a frightful and clandestine system of assemblies
and orgies descended from dark religions antedating the Aryan world, and appearing in popular
legends as Black Masses and Witches’ Sabbaths. That these hellish vestiges of old
Turanian-Asiatic magic and fertility-cults were even now wholly dead he could not for a moment
suppose, and he frequently wondered how much older and how much blacker than the very worst of the
muttered tales some of them might really be.
III.

It was the case of Robert Suydam which took Malone to the heart of things in Red Hook. Suydam
was a lettered recluse of ancient Dutch family, possessed originally of barely independent means,
and inhabiting the spacious but ill-preserved mansion which his grandfather had built in Flatbush
when that village was little more than a pleasant group of colonial cottages surrounding the
steepled and ivy-clad Reformed Church with its iron-railed yard of Netherlandish gravestones.
In his lonely house, set back from Martense Street amidst a yard of venerable trees, Suydam
had read and brooded for some six decades except for a period a generation before, when he had
sailed for the old world and remained there out of sight for eight years. He could afford no
servants, and would admit but few visitors to his absolute solitude; eschewing close friendships
and receiving his rare acquaintances in one of the three ground-floor rooms which he kept in
order—a vast, high-ceiled library whose walls were solidly packed with tattered books
of ponderous, archaic, and vaguely repellent aspect. The growth of the town and its final absorption
in the Brooklyn district had meant nothing to Suydam, and he had come to mean less and less
to the town. Elderly people still pointed him out on the streets, but to most of the recent
population he was merely a queer, corpulent old fellow whose unkempt white hair, stubbly beard,
shiny black clothes, and gold-headed cane earned him an amused glance and nothing more. Malone
did not know him by sight till duty called him to the case, but had heard of him indirectly
as a really profound authority on mediaeval superstition, and had once idly meant to look up
an out-of-print pamphlet of his on the Kabbalah and the Faustus legend, which a friend had quoted
from memory.
Suydam became a “case” when his distant and only relatives sought
court pronouncements on his sanity. Their action seemed sudden to the outside world, but was
really undertaken only after prolonged observation and sorrowful debate. It was based on certain
odd changes in his speech and habits; wild references to impending wonders, and unaccountable
hauntings of disreputable Brooklyn neighbourhoods. He had been growing shabbier and shabbier
with the years, and now prowled about like a veritable mendicant; seen occasionally by humiliated
friends in subway stations, or loitering on the benches around Borough Hall in conversation
with groups of swarthy, evil-looking strangers. When he spoke it was to babble of unlimited
powers almost within his grasp, and to repeat with knowing leers such mystical words or names
as “Sephiroth”, “Ashmodai”, and “Samaël”. The court
action revealed that he was using up his income and wasting his principal in the purchase of
curious tomes imported from London and Paris, and in the maintenance of a squalid basement flat
in the Red Hook district where he spent nearly every night, receiving odd delegations of mixed
rowdies and foreigners, and apparently conducting some kind of ceremonial service behind the
green blinds of secretive windows. Detectives assigned to follow him reported strange cries
and chants and prancing of feet filtering out from these nocturnal rites, and shuddered at their
peculiar ecstasy and abandon despite the commonness of weird orgies in that sodden section.
When, however, the matter came to a hearing, Suydam managed to preserve his liberty. Before
the judge his manner grew urbane and reasonable, and he freely admitted the queerness of demeanour
and extravagant cast of language into which he had fallen through excessive devotion to study
and research. He was, he said, engaged in the investigation of certain details of European tradition
which required the closest contact with foreign groups and their songs and folk dances. The
notion that any low secret society was preying upon him, as hinted by his relatives, was obviously
absurd; and shewed how sadly limited was their understanding of him and his work. Triumphing
with his calm explanations, he was suffered to depart unhindered; and the paid detectives of
the Suydams, Corlears, and Van Brunts were withdrawn in resigned disgust.
It was here that an alliance of Federal inspectors and police, Malone with
them, entered the case. The law had watched the Suydam action with interest, and had in many
instances been called upon to aid the private detectives. In this work it developed that Suydam’s
new associates were among the blackest and most vicious criminals of Red Hook’s devious
lanes, and that at least a third of them were known and repeated offenders in the matter of
thievery, disorder, and the importation of illegal immigrants. Indeed, it would not have been
too much to say that the old scholar’s particular circle coincided almost perfectly with
the worst of the organised cliques which smuggled ashore certain nameless and unclassified Asian
dregs wisely turned back by Ellis Island. In the teeming rookeries of Parker Place—since
renamed—where Suydam had his basement flat, there had grown up a very unusual colony of
unclassified slant-eyed folk who used the Arabic alphabet but were eloquently repudiated by
the great mass of Syrians in and around Atlantic Avenue. They could all have been deported for
lack of credentials, but legalism is slow-moving, and one does not disturb Red Hook unless publicity
forces one to.
These creatures attended a tumbledown stone church, used Wednesdays as a dance-hall,
which reared its Gothic buttresses near the vilest part of the waterfront. It was nominally
Catholic; but priests throughout Brooklyn denied the place all standing and authenticity, and
policemen agreed with them when they listened to the noises it emitted at night. Malone used
to fancy he heard terrible cracked bass notes from a hidden organ far underground when the church
stood empty and unlighted, whilst all observers dreaded the shrieking and drumming which accompanied
the visible services. Suydam, when questioned, said he thought the ritual was some remnant of
Nestorian Christianity tinctured with the Shamanism of Thibet. Most of the people, he conjectured,
were of Mongoloid stock, originating somewhere in or near Kurdistan—and Malone could not
help recalling that Kurdistan is the land of the Yezidis, last survivors of the Persian devil-worshippers.
However this may have been, the stir of the Suydam investigation made it certain that these
unauthorised newcomers were flooding Red Hook in increasing numbers; entering through some marine
conspiracy unreached by revenue officers and harbour police, overrunning Parker Place and rapidly
spreading up the hill, and welcomed with curious fraternalism by the other assorted denizens
of the region. Their squat figures and characteristic squinting physiognomies, grotesquely combined
with flashy American clothing, appeared more and more numerously among the loafers and nomad
gangsters of the Borough Hall section; till at length it was deemed necessary to compute their
numbers, ascertain their sources and occupations, and find if possible a way to round them up
and deliver them to the proper immigration authorities. To this task Malone was assigned by
agreement of Federal and city forces, and as he commenced his canvass of Red Hook he felt poised
upon the brink of nameless terrors, with the shabby, unkempt figure of Robert Suydam as arch-fiend
and adversary.
IV.

Police methods are varied and ingenious. Malone, through unostentatious rambles, carefully casual
conversations, well-timed offers of hip-pocket liquor, and judicious dialogues with frightened
prisoners, learned many isolated facts about the movement whose aspect had become so menacing.
The newcomers were indeed Kurds, but of a dialect obscure and puzzling to exact philology. Such
of them as worked lived mostly as dock-hands and unlicenced pedlars, though frequently serving
in Greek restaurants and tending corner news stands. Most of them, however, had no visible means
of support; and were obviously connected with underworld pursuits, of which smuggling and “bootlegging”
were the least indescribable. They had come in steamships, apparently tramp freighters, and
had been unloaded by stealth on moonless nights in rowboats which stole under a certain wharf
and followed a hidden canal to a secret subterranean pool beneath a house. This wharf, canal,
and house Malone could not locate, for the memories of his informants were exceedingly confused,
while their speech was to a great extent beyond even the ablest interpreters; nor could he gain
any real data on the reasons for their systematic importation. They were reticent about the
exact spot from which they had come, and were never sufficiently off guard to reveal the agencies
which had sought them out and directed their course. Indeed, they developed something like acute
fright when asked the reasons for their presence. Gangsters of other breeds were equally taciturn,
and the most that could be gathered was that some god or great priesthood had promised them
unheard-of powers and supernatural glories and rulerships in a strange land.
The attendance of both newcomers and old gangsters at Suydam’s closely
guarded nocturnal meetings was very regular, and the police soon learned that the erstwhile
recluse had leased additional flats to accommodate such guests as knew his password; at last
occupying three entire houses and permanently harbouring many of his queer companions. He spent
but little time now at his Flatbush home, apparently going and coming only to obtain and return
books; and his face and manner had attained an appalling pitch of wildness. Malone twice interviewed
him, but was each time brusquely repulsed. He knew nothing, he said, of any mysterious plots
or movements; and had no idea how the Kurds could have entered or what they wanted. His business
was to study undisturbed the folklore of all the immigrants of the district; a business with
which policemen had no legitimate concern. Malone mentioned his admiration for Suydam’s
old brochure on the Kabbalah and other myths, but the old man’s softening was only momentary.
He sensed an intrusion, and rebuffed his visitor in no uncertain way; till Malone withdrew disgusted,
and turned to other channels of information.
What Malone would have unearthed could he have worked continuously on the case,
we shall never know. As it was, a stupid conflict between city and Federal authority suspended
the investigations for several months, during which the detective was busy with other assignments.
But at no time did he lose interest, or fail to stand amazed at what began to happen to Robert
Suydam. Just at the time when a wave of kidnappings and disappearances spread its excitement
over New York, the unkempt scholar embarked upon a metamorphosis as startling as it was absurd.
One day he was seen near Borough Hall with clean-shaved face, well-trimmed hair, and tastefully
immaculate attire, and on every day thereafter some obscure improvement was noticed in him.
He maintained his new fastidiousness without interruption, added to it an unwonted sparkle of
eye and crispness of speech, and began little by little to shed the corpulence which had so
long deformed him. Now frequently taken for less than his age, he acquired an elasticity of
step and buoyancy of demeanour to match the new tradition, and shewed a curious darkening of
the hair which somehow did not suggest dye. As the months passed, he commenced to dress less
and less conservatively, and finally astonished his new friends by renovating and redecorating
his Flatbush mansion, which he threw open in a series of receptions, summoning all the acquaintances
he could remember, and extending a special welcome to the fully forgiven relatives who had so
lately sought his restraint. Some attended through curiosity, others through duty; but all were
suddenly charmed by the dawning grace and urbanity of the former hermit. He had, he asserted,
accomplished most of his allotted work; and having just inherited some property from a half-forgotten
European friend, was about to spend his remaining years in a brighter second youth which ease,
care, and diet had made possible to him. Less and less was he seen at Red Hook, and more and
more did he move in the society to which he was born. Policemen noted a tendency of the gangsters
to congregate at the old stone church and dance-hall instead of at the basement flat in Parker
Place, though the latter and its recent annexes still overflowed with noxious life.
Then two incidents occurred—wide enough apart, but both of intense interest
in the case as Malone envisaged it. One was a quiet announcement in the Eagle of Robert
Suydam’s engagement to Miss Cornelia Gerritsen of Bayside, a young woman of excellent
position, and distantly related to the elderly bridegroom-elect; whilst the other was a raid
on the dance-hall church by city police, after a report that the face of a kidnapped child had
been seen for a second at one of the basement windows. Malone had participated in this raid,
and studied the place with much care when inside. Nothing was found—in fact, the building
was entirely deserted when visited—but the sensitive Celt was vaguely disturbed by many
things about the interior. There were crudely painted panels he did not like—panels which
depicted sacred faces with peculiarly worldly and sardonic expressions, and which occasionally
took liberties that even a layman’s sense of decorum could scarcely countenance. Then,
too, he did not relish the Greek inscription on the wall above the pulpit; an ancient incantation
which he had once stumbled upon in Dublin college days, and which read, literally translated,
“O friend and companion of night, thou who rejoicest in the baying of
dogs and spilt blood, who wanderest in the midst of shades among the tombs, who longest for
blood and bringest terror to mortals, Gorgo, Mormo, thousand-faced moon, look favourably on
our sacrifices!”

When he read this he shuddered, and thought vaguely of the cracked bass organ notes he fancied
he had heard beneath the church on certain nights. He shuddered again at the rust around the
rim of a metal basin which stood on the altar, and paused nervously when his nostrils seemed
to detect a curious and ghastly stench from somewhere in the neighbourhood. That organ memory
haunted him, and he explored the basement with particular assiduity before he left. The place
was very hateful to him; yet after all, were the blasphemous panels and inscriptions more than
mere crudities perpetrated by the ignorant?
By the time of Suydam’s wedding the kidnapping epidemic had become a
popular newspaper scandal. Most of the victims were young children of the lowest classes, but
the increasing number of disappearances had worked up a sentiment of the strongest fury. Journals
clamoured for action from the police, and once more the Butler Street station sent its men over
Red Hook for clues, discoveries, and criminals. Malone was glad to be on the trail again, and
took pride in a raid on one of Suydam’s Parker Place houses. There, indeed, no stolen
child was found, despite the tales of screams and the red sash picked up in the areaway; but
the paintings and rough inscriptions on the peeling walls of most of the rooms, and the primitive
chemical laboratory in the attic, all helped to convince the detective that he was on the track
of something tremendous. The paintings were appalling—hideous monsters of every shape
and size, and parodies on human outlines which cannot be described. The writing was in red,
and varied from Arabic to Greek, Roman, and Hebrew letters. Malone could not read much of it,
but what he did decipher was portentous and cabbalistic enough. One frequently repeated motto
was in a sort of Hebraised Hellenistic Greek, and suggested the most terrible daemon-evocations
of the Alexandrian decadence:
“HEL • HELOYM • SOTHER • EMMANVEL • SABAOTH • AGLA
• TETRAGRAMMATON • AGYROS • OTHEOS • ISCHYROS • ATHANATOS • IEHOVA
• VA • ADONAI • SADAY • HOMOVSION • MESSIAS • ESCHEREHEYE.”

Circles and pentagrams loomed on every hand, and told indubitably of the strange beliefs and
aspirations of those who dwelt so squalidly here. In the cellar, however, the strangest thing
was found—a pile of genuine gold ingots covered carelessly with a piece of burlap, and
bearing upon their shining surfaces the same weird hieroglyphics which also adorned the walls.
During the raid the police encountered only a passive resistance from the squinting Orientals
that swarmed from every door. Finding nothing relevant, they had to leave all as it was; but
the precinct captain wrote Suydam a note advising him to look closely to the character of his
tenants and protégés in view of the growing public clamour.
V.

Then came the June wedding and the great sensation. Flatbush was gay for the hour about high
noon, and pennanted motors thronged the streets near the old Dutch church where an awning stretched
from door to highway. No local event ever surpassed the Suydam-Gerritsen nuptials in tone and
scale, and the party which escorted bride and groom to the Cunard Pier was, if not exactly the
smartest, at least a solid page from the Social Register. At five o’clock adieux were
waved, and the ponderous liner edged away from the long pier, slowly turned its nose seaward,
discarded its tug, and headed for the widening water spaces that led to old world wonders. By
night the outer harbour was cleared, and late passengers watched the stars twinkling above an
unpolluted ocean.
Whether the tramp steamer or the scream was first to gain attention, no one
can say. Probably they were simultaneous, but it is of no use to calculate. The scream came
from the Suydam stateroom, and the sailor who broke down the door could perhaps have told frightful
things if he had not forthwith gone completely mad—as it is, he shrieked more loudly than
the first victims, and thereafter ran simpering about the vessel till caught and put in irons.
The ship’s doctor who entered the stateroom and turned on the lights a moment later did
not go mad, but told nobody what he saw till afterward, when he corresponded with Malone in
Chepachet. It was murder—strangulation—but one need not say that the claw-mark on
Mrs. Suydam’s throat could not have come from her husband’s or any other human hand,
or that upon the white wall there flickered for an instant in hateful red a legend which, later
copied from memory, seems to have been nothing less than the fearsome Chaldee letters of the
word “LILITH”. One need not mention these things because they vanished so quickly—as
for Suydam, one could at least bar others from the room until one knew what to think oneself.
The doctor has distinctly assured Malone that he did not see IT. The open porthole, just
before he turned on the lights, was clouded for a second with a certain phosphorescence, and
for a moment there seemed to echo in the night outside the suggestion of a faint and hellish
tittering; but no real outline met the eye. As proof, the doctor points to his continued sanity.
Then the tramp steamer claimed all attention. A boat put off, and a horde of
swart, insolent ruffians in officers’ dress swarmed aboard the temporarily halted Cunarder.
They wanted Suydam or his body—they had known of his trip, and for certain reasons were
sure he would die. The captain’s deck was almost a pandemonium; for at the instant, between
the doctor’s report from the stateroom and the demands of the men from the tramp, not
even the wisest and gravest seaman could think what to do. Suddenly the leader of the visiting
mariners, an Arab with a hatefully negroid mouth, pulled forth a dirty, crumpled paper and handed
it to the captain. It was signed by Robert Suydam, and bore the following odd message:
“In case of sudden or unexplained accident or death on my part, please
deliver me or my body unquestioningly into the hands of the bearer and his associates. Everything,
for me, and perhaps for you, depends on absolute compliance. Explanations can come later—do
not fail me now.
ROBERT SUYDAM.”
Captain and doctor looked at each other, and the latter whispered something
to the former. Finally they nodded rather helplessly and led the way to the Suydam stateroom.
The doctor directed the captain’s glance away as he unlocked the door and admitted the
strange seamen, nor did he breathe easily till they filed out with their burden after an unaccountably
long period of preparation. It was wrapped in bedding from the berths, and the doctor was glad
that the outlines were not very revealing. Somehow the men got the thing over the side and away
to their tramp steamer without uncovering it. The Cunarder started again, and the doctor and
a ship’s undertaker sought out the Suydam stateroom to perform what last services they
could. Once more the physician was forced to reticence and even to mendacity, for a hellish
thing had happened. When the undertaker asked him why he had drained off all of Mrs. Suydam’s
blood, he neglected to affirm that he had not done so; nor did he point to the vacant bottle-spaces
on the rack, or to the odour in the sink which shewed the hasty disposition of the bottles’
original contents. The pockets of those men—if men they were—had bulged damnably
when they left the ship. Two hours later, and the world knew by radio all that it ought to know
of the horrible affair.
VI.

That same June evening, without having heard a word from the sea, Malone was desperately busy
among the alleys of Red Hook. A sudden stir seemed to permeate the place, and as if apprised
by “grapevine telegraph” of something singular, the denizens clustered expectantly
around the dance-hall church and the houses in Parker Place. Three children had just disappeared—blue-eyed
Norwegians from the streets toward Gowanus—and there were rumours of a mob forming among
the sturdy Vikings of that section. Malone had for weeks been urging his colleagues to attempt
a general cleanup; and at last, moved by conditions more obvious to their common sense than
the conjectures of a Dublin dreamer, they had agreed upon a final stroke. The unrest and menace
of this evening had been the deciding factor, and just about midnight a raiding party recruited
from three stations descended upon Parker Place and its environs. Doors were battered in, stragglers
arrested, and candlelighted rooms forced to disgorge unbelievable throngs of mixed foreigners
in figured robes, mitres, and other inexplicable devices. Much was lost in the melee, for objects
were thrown hastily down unexpected shafts, and betraying odours deadened by the sudden kindling
of pungent incense. But spattered blood was everywhere, and Malone shuddered whenever he saw
a brazier or altar from which the smoke was still rising.
He wanted to be in several places at once, and decided on Suydam’s basement
flat only after a messenger had reported the complete emptiness of the dilapidated dance-hall
church. The flat, he thought, must hold some clue to a cult of which the occult scholar had
so obviously become the centre and leader; and it was with real expectancy that he ransacked
the musty rooms, noted their vaguely charnel odour, and examined the curious books, instruments,
gold ingots, and glass-stoppered bottles scattered carelessly here and there. Once a lean, black-and-white
cat edged between his feet and tripped him, overturning at the same time a beaker half full
of a red liquid. The shock was severe, and to this day Malone is not certain of what he saw;
but in dreams he still pictures that cat as it scuttled away with certain monstrous alterations
and peculiarities. Then came the locked cellar door, and the search for something to break it
down. A heavy stool stood near, and its tough seat was more than enough for the antique panels.
A crack formed and enlarged, and the whole door gave way—but from the other side;
whence poured a howling tumult of ice-cold wind with all the stenches of the bottomless pit,
and whence reached a sucking force not of earth or heaven, which, coiling sentiently about the
paralysed detective, dragged him through the aperture and down unmeasured spaces filled with
whispers and wails, and gusts of mocking laughter.
Of course it was a dream. All the specialists have told him so, and he has
nothing to prove the contrary. Indeed, he would rather have it thus; for then the sight of old
brick slums and dark foreign faces would not eat so deeply into his soul. But at the time it
was all horribly real, and nothing can ever efface the memory of those nighted crypts, those
titan arcades, and those half-formed shapes of hell that strode gigantically in silence holding
half-eaten things whose still surviving portions screamed for mercy or laughed with madness.
Odours of incense and corruption joined in sickening concert, and the black air was alive with
the cloudy, semi-visible bulk of shapeless elemental things with eyes. Somewhere dark sticky
water was lapping at onyx piers, and once the shivery tinkle of raucous little bells pealed
out to greet the insane titter of a naked phosphorescent thing which swam into sight, scrambled
ashore, and climbed up to squat leeringly on a carved golden pedestal in the background.
Avenues of limitless night seemed to radiate in every direction, till one might
fancy that here lay the root of a contagion destined to sicken and swallow cities, and engulf
nations in the foetor of hybrid pestilence. Here cosmic sin had entered, and festered by unhallowed
rites had commenced the grinning march of death that was to rot us all to fungous abnormalities
too hideous for the grave’s holding. Satan here held his Babylonish court, and in the
blood of stainless childhood the leprous limbs of phosphorescent Lilith were laved. Incubi and
succubae howled praise to Hecate, and headless moon-calves bleated to the Magna Mater. Goats
leaped to the sound of thin accursed flutes, and aegipans chased endlessly after misshapen fauns
over rocks twisted like swollen toads. Moloch and Ashtaroth were not absent; for in this quintessence
of all damnation the bounds of consciousness were let down, and man’s fancy lay open to
vistas of every realm of horror and every forbidden dimension that evil had power to mould.
The world and Nature were helpless against such assaults from unsealed wells of night, nor could
any sign or prayer check the Walpurgis-riot of horror which had come when a sage with the hateful
key had stumbled on a horde with the locked and brimming coffer of transmitted daemon-lore.
Suddenly a ray of physical light shot through these phantasms, and Malone heard
the sound of oars amidst the blasphemies of things that should be dead. A boat with a lantern
in its prow darted into sight, made fast to an iron ring in the slimy stone pier, and vomited
forth several dark men bearing a long burden swathed in bedding. They took it to the naked phosphorescent
thing on the carved golden pedestal, and the thing tittered and pawed at the bedding. Then they
unswathed it, and propped upright before the pedestal the gangrenous corpse of a corpulent old
man with stubbly beard and unkempt white hair. The phosphorescent thing tittered again, and
the men produced bottles from their pockets and anointed its feet with red, whilst they afterward
gave the bottles to the thing to drink from.
All at once, from an arcaded avenue leading endlessly away, there came the
daemoniac rattle and wheeze of a blasphemous organ, choking and rumbling out the mockeries of
hell in a cracked, sardonic bass. In an instant every moving entity was electrified; and forming
at once into a ceremonial procession, the nightmare horde slithered away in quest of the sound—goat,
satyr, and aegipan, incubus, succuba, and lemur, twisted toad and shapeless elemental, dog-faced
howler and silent strutter in darkness—all led by the abominable naked phosphorescent
thing that had squatted on the carved golden throne, and that now strode insolently bearing
in its arms the glassy-eyed corpse of the corpulent old man. The strange dark men danced in
the rear, and the whole column skipped and leaped with Dionysiac fury. Malone staggered after
them a few steps, delirious and hazy, and doubtful of his place in this or in any world. Then
he turned, faltered, and sank down on the cold damp stone, gasping and shivering as the daemon
organ croaked on, and the howling and drumming and tinkling of the mad procession grew fainter
and fainter.
Vaguely he was conscious of chanted horrors and shocking croakings afar off.
Now and then a wail or whine of ceremonial devotion would float to him through the black arcade,
whilst eventually there rose the dreadful Greek incantation whose text he had read above the
pulpit of that dance-hall church.
“O friend and companion of night, thou who rejoicest in the baying of
dogs (here a hideous howl burst forth) and spilt blood (here nameless sounds vied
with morbid shriekings), who wanderest in the midst of shades among the tombs (here a
whistling sigh occurred), who longest for blood and bringest terror to mortals (short,
sharp cries from myriad throats), Gorgo (repeated as response), Mormo (repeated
with ecstasy), thousand-faced moon (sighs and flute notes), look favourably on our
sacrifices!”
As the chant closed, a general shout went up, and hissing sounds nearly drowned
the croaking of the cracked bass organ. Then a gasp as from many throats, and a babel of barked
and bleated words—“Lilith, Great Lilith, behold the Bridegroom!” More cries,
a clamour of rioting, and the sharp, clicking footfalls of a running figure. The footfalls approached,
and Malone raised himself to his elbow to look.
The luminosity of the crypt, lately diminished, had now slightly increased;
and in that devil-light there appeared the fleeing form of that which should not flee or feel
or breathe—the glassy-eyed, gangrenous corpse of the corpulent old man, now needing no
support, but animated by some infernal sorcery of the rite just closed. After it raced the naked,
tittering, phosphorescent thing that belonged on the carven pedestal, and still farther behind
panted the dark men, and all the dread crew of sentient loathsomenesses. The corpse was gaining
on its pursuers, and seemed bent on a definite object, straining with every rotting muscle toward
the carved golden pedestal, whose necromantic importance was evidently so great. Another moment
and it had reached its goal, whilst the trailing throng laboured on with more frantic speed.
But they were too late, for in one final spurt of strength which ripped tendon from tendon and
sent its noisome bulk floundering to the floor in a state of jellyish dissolution, the staring
corpse which had been Robert Suydam achieved its object and its triumph. The push had been tremendous,
but the force had held out; and as the pusher collapsed to a muddy blotch of corruption the
pedestal he had pushed tottered, tipped, and finally careened from its onyx base into the thick
waters below, sending up a parting gleam of carven gold as it sank heavily to undreamable gulfs
of lower Tartarus. In that instant, too, the whole scene of horror faded to nothingness before
Malone’s eyes; and he fainted amidst a thunderous crash which seemed to blot out all the
evil universe.
VII.

Malone’s dream, experienced in full before he knew of Suydam’s death and transfer
at sea, was curiously supplemented by some odd realities of the case; though that is no reason
why anyone should believe it. The three old houses in Parker Place, doubtless long rotten with
decay in its most insidious form, collapsed without visible cause while half the raiders and
most of the prisoners were inside; and of both the greater number were instantly killed. Only
in the basements and cellars was there much saving of life, and Malone was lucky to have been
deep below the house of Robert Suydam. For he really was there, as no one is disposed to deny.
They found him unconscious by the edge of a night-black pool, with a grotesquely horrible jumble
of decay and bone, identifiable through dental work as the body of Suydam, a few feet away.
The case was plain, for it was hither that the smugglers’ underground canal led; and the
men who took Suydam from the ship had brought him home. They themselves were never found, or
at least never identified; and the ship’s doctor is not yet satisfied with the simple
certitudes of the police.
Suydam was evidently a leader in extensive man-smuggling operations, for the
canal to his house was but one of several subterranean channels and tunnels in the neighbourhood.
There was a tunnel from this house to a crypt beneath the dance-hall church; a crypt accessible
from the church only through a narrow secret passage in the north wall, and in whose chambers
some singular and terrible things were discovered. The croaking organ was there, as well as
a vast arched chapel with wooden benches and a strangely figured altar. The walls were lined
with small cells, in seventeen of which—hideous to relate—solitary prisoners in
a state of complete idiocy were found chained, including four mothers with infants of disturbingly
strange appearance. These infants died soon after exposure to the light; a circumstance which
the doctors thought rather merciful. Nobody but Malone, among those who inspected them, remembered
the sombre question of old Delrio: “An sint unquam daemones incubi et succubae, et
an ex tali congressu proles nasci queat?”
Before the canals were filled up they were thoroughly dredged, and yielded
forth a sensational array of sawed and split bones of all sizes. The kidnapping epidemic, very
clearly, had been traced home; though only two of the surviving prisoners could by any legal
thread be connected with it. These men are now in prison, since they failed of conviction as
accessories in the actual murders. The carved golden pedestal or throne so often mentioned by
Malone as of primary occult importance was never brought to light, though at one place under
the Suydam house the canal was observed to sink into a well too deep for dredging. It was choked
up at the mouth and cemented over when the cellars of the new houses were made, but Malone often
speculates on what lies beneath. The police, satisfied that they had shattered a dangerous gang
of maniacs and man-smugglers, turned over to the Federal authorities the unconvicted Kurds,
who before their deportation were conclusively found to belong to the Yezidi clan of devil-worshippers.
The tramp ship and its crew remain an elusive mystery, though cynical detectives are once more
ready to combat its smuggling and rum-running ventures. Malone thinks these detectives shew
a sadly limited perspective in their lack of wonder at the myriad unexplainable details, and
the suggestive obscurity of the whole case; though he is just as critical of the newspapers,
which saw only a morbid sensation and gloated over a minor sadist cult which they might have
proclaimed a horror from the universe’s very heart. But he is content to rest silent in
Chepachet, calming his nervous system and praying that time may gradually transfer his terrible
experience from the realm of present reality to that of picturesque and semi-mythical remoteness.
Robert Suydam sleeps beside his bride in Greenwood Cemetery. No funeral was
held over the strangely released bones, and relatives are grateful for the swift oblivion which
overtook the case as a whole. The scholar’s connexion with the Red Hook horrors, indeed,
was never emblazoned by legal proof; since his death forestalled the inquiry he would otherwise
have faced. His own end is not much mentioned, and the Suydams hope that posterity may recall
him only as a gentle recluse who dabbled in harmless magic and folklore.
As for Red Hook—it is always the same. Suydam came and went; a terror
gathered and faded; but the evil spirit of darkness and squalor broods on amongst the mongrels
in the old brick houses, and prowling bands still parade on unknown errands past windows where
lights and twisted faces unaccountably appear and disappear. Age-old horror is a hydra with
a thousand heads, and the cults of darkness are rooted in blasphemies deeper than the well of
Democritus. The soul of the beast is omnipresent and triumphant, and Red Hook’s legions
of blear-eyed, pockmarked youths still chant and curse and howl as they file from abyss to abyss,
none knows whence or whither, pushed on by blind laws of biology which they may never understand.
As of old, more people enter Red Hook than leave it on the landward side, and there are already
rumours of new canals running underground to certain centres of traffic in liquor and less mentionable
things.
The dance-hall church is now mostly a dance-hall, and queer faces have appeared
at night at the windows. Lately a policeman expressed the belief that the filled-up crypt has
been dug out again, and for no simply explainable purpose. Who are we to combat poisons older
than history and mankind? Apes danced in Asia to those horrors, and the cancer lurks secure
and spreading where furtiveness hides in rows of decaying brick.
Malone does not shudder without cause—for only the other day an officer
overheard a swarthy squinting hag teaching a small child some whispered patois in the shadow
of an areaway. He listened, and thought it very strange when he heard her repeat over and over
again,
“O friend and companion of night, thou who rejoicest in the baying of
dogs and spilt blood, who wanderest in the midst of shades among the tombs, who longest for
blood and bringest terror to mortals, Gorgo, Mormo, thousand-faced moon, look favourably on
our sacrifices!”

I have seen the dark universe yawning
Where the black planets roll without aim—
Where they roll in their horror unheeded,
Without knowledge or lustre or name.
—Nemesis.

Cautious investigators will hesitate to challenge the common belief that Robert Blake was killed
by lightning, or by some profound nervous shock derived from an electrical discharge. It is
true that the window he faced was unbroken, but Nature has shewn herself capable of many freakish
performances. The expression on his face may easily have arisen from some obscure muscular source
unrelated to anything he saw, while the entries in his diary are clearly the result of a fantastic
imagination aroused by certain local superstitions and by certain old matters he had uncovered.
As for the anomalous conditions at the deserted church on Federal Hill—the shrewd analyst
is not slow in attributing them to some charlatanry, conscious or unconscious, with at least
some of which Blake was secretly connected.
For after all, the victim was a writer and painter wholly devoted to the field
of myth, dream, terror, and superstition, and avid in his quest for scenes and effects of a
bizarre, spectral sort. His earlier stay in the city—a visit to a strange old man as deeply
given to occult and forbidden lore as he—had ended amidst death and flame, and it must
have been some morbid instinct which drew him back from his home in Milwaukee. He may have known
of the old stories despite his statements to the contrary in the diary, and his death may have
nipped in the bud some stupendous hoax destined to have a literary reflection.
Among those, however, who have examined and correlated all this evidence, there
remain several who cling to less rational and commonplace theories. They are inclined to take
much of Blake’s diary at its face value, and point significantly to certain facts such
as the undoubted genuineness of the old church record, the verified existence of the disliked
and unorthodox Starry Wisdom sect prior to 1877, the recorded disappearance of an inquisitive
reporter named Edwin M. Lillibridge in 1893, and—above all—the look of monstrous,
transfiguring fear on the face of the young writer when he died. It was one of these believers
who, moved to fanatical extremes, threw into the bay the curiously angled stone and its strangely
adorned metal box found in the old church steeple—the black windowless steeple, and not
the tower where Blake’s diary said those things originally were. Though widely censured
both officially and unofficially, this man—a reputable physician with a taste for odd
folklore—averred that he had rid the earth of something too dangerous to rest upon it.
Between these two schools of opinion the reader must judge for himself. The
papers have given the tangible details from a sceptical angle, leaving for others the drawing
of the picture as Robert Blake saw it—or thought he saw it—or pretended to see it.
Now, studying the diary closely, dispassionately, and at leisure, let us summarise the dark
chain of events from the expressed point of view of their chief actor.
Young Blake returned to Providence in the winter of 1934–5, taking the
upper floor of a venerable dwelling in a grassy court off College Street—on the crest
of the great eastward hill near the Brown University campus and behind the marble John Hay Library.
It was a cosy and fascinating place, in a little garden oasis of village-like antiquity where
huge, friendly cats sunned themselves atop a convenient shed. The square Georgian house had
a monitor roof, classic doorway with fan carving, small-paned windows, and all the other earmarks
of early nineteenth-century workmanship. Inside were six-panelled doors, wide floor-boards,
a curving colonial staircase, white Adam-period mantels, and a rear set of rooms three steps
below the general level.
Blake’s study, a large southwest chamber, overlooked the front garden
on one side, while its west windows—before one of which he had his desk—faced off
from the brow of the hill and commanded a splendid view of the lower town’s outspread
roofs and of the mystical sunsets that flamed behind them. On the far horizon were the open
countryside’s purple slopes. Against these, some two miles away, rose the spectral hump
of Federal Hill, bristling with huddled roofs and steeples whose remote outlines wavered mysteriously,
taking fantastic forms as the smoke of the city swirled up and enmeshed them. Blake had a curious
sense that he was looking upon some unknown, ethereal world which might or might not vanish
in dream if ever he tried to seek it out and enter it in person.
Having sent home for most of his books, Blake bought some antique furniture
suitable to his quarters and settled down to write and paint—living alone, and attending
to the simple housework himself. His studio was in a north attic room, where the panes of the
monitor roof furnished admirable lighting. During that first winter he produced five of his
best-known short stories—“The Burrower Beneath”, “The Stairs in the
Crypt”, “Shaggai”, “In the Vale of Pnath”, and “The Feaster
from the Stars”—and painted seven canvases; studies of nameless, unhuman monsters,
and profoundly alien, non-terrestrial landscapes.
At sunset he would often sit at his desk and gaze dreamily off at the outspread
west—the dark towers of Memorial Hall just below, the Georgian court-house belfry, the
lofty pinnacles of the downtown section, and that shimmering, spire-crowned mound in the distance
whose unknown streets and labyrinthine gables so potently provoked his fancy. From his few local
acquaintances he learned that the far-off slope was a vast Italian quarter, though most of the
houses were remnants of older Yankee and Irish days. Now and then he would train his field-glasses
on that spectral, unreachable world beyond the curling smoke; picking out individual roofs and
chimneys and steeples, and speculating upon the bizarre and curious mysteries they might house.
Even with optical aid Federal Hill seemed somehow alien, half fabulous, and linked to the unreal,
intangible marvels of Blake’s own tales and pictures. The feeling would persist long after
the hill had faded into the violet, lamp-starred twilight, and the court-house floodlights and
the red Industrial Trust beacon had blazed up to make the night grotesque.
Of all the distant objects on Federal Hill, a certain huge, dark church most
fascinated Blake. It stood out with especial distinctness at certain hours of the day, and at
sunset the great tower and tapering steeple loomed blackly against the flaming sky. It seemed
to rest on especially high ground; for the grimy facade, and the obliquely seen north side with
sloping roof and the tops of great pointed windows, rose boldly above the tangle of surrounding
ridgepoles and chimney-pots. Peculiarly grim and austere, it appeared to be built of stone,
stained and weathered with the smoke and storms of a century and more. The style, so far as
the glass could shew, was that earliest experimental form of Gothic revival which preceded the
stately Upjohn period and held over some of the outlines and proportions of the Georgian age.
Perhaps it was reared around 1810 or 1815.
As months passed, Blake watched the far-off, forbidding structure with an oddly
mounting interest. Since the vast windows were never lighted, he knew that it must be vacant.
The longer he watched, the more his imagination worked, till at length he began to fancy curious
things. He believed that a vague, singular aura of desolation hovered over the place, so that
even the pigeons and swallows shunned its smoky eaves. Around other towers and belfries his
glass would reveal great flocks of birds, but here they never rested. At least, that is what
he thought and set down in his diary. He pointed the place out to several friends, but none
of them had even been on Federal Hill or possessed the faintest notion of what the church was
or had been.
In the spring a deep restlessness gripped Blake. He had begun his long-planned
novel—based on a supposed survival of the witch-cult in Maine—but was strangely
unable to make progress with it. More and more he would sit at his westward window and gaze
at the distant hill and the black, frowning steeple shunned by the birds. When the delicate
leaves came out on the garden boughs the world was filled with a new beauty, but Blake’s
restlessness was merely increased. It was then that he first thought of crossing the city and
climbing bodily up that fabulous slope into the smoke-wreathed world of dream.
Late in April, just before the aeon-shadowed Walpurgis time, Blake made his
first trip into the unknown. Plodding through the endless downtown streets and the bleak, decayed
squares beyond, he came finally upon the ascending avenue of century-worn steps, sagging Doric
porches, and blear-paned cupolas which he felt must lead up to the long-known, unreachable world
beyond the mists. There were dingy blue-and-white street signs which meant nothing to him, and
presently he noted the strange, dark faces of the drifting crowds, and the foreign signs over
curious shops in brown, decade-weathered buildings. Nowhere could he find any of the objects
he had seen from afar; so that once more he half fancied that the Federal Hill of that distant
view was a dream-world never to be trod by living human feet.
Now and then a battered church facade or crumbling spire came in sight, but
never the blackened pile that he sought. When he asked a shopkeeper about a great stone church
the man smiled and shook his head, though he spoke English freely. As Blake climbed higher,
the region seemed stranger and stranger, with bewildering mazes of brooding brown alleys leading
eternally off to the south. He crossed two or three broad avenues, and once thought he glimpsed
a familiar tower. Again he asked a merchant about the massive church of stone, and this time
he could have sworn that the plea of ignorance was feigned. The dark man’s face had a
look of fear which he tried to hide, and Blake saw him make a curious sign with his right hand.
Then suddenly a black spire stood out against the cloudy sky on his left, above
the tiers of brown roofs lining the tangled southerly alleys. Blake knew at once what it was,
and plunged toward it through the squalid, unpaved lanes that climbed from the avenue. Twice
he lost his way, but he somehow dared not ask any of the patriarchs or housewives who sat on
their doorsteps, or any of the children who shouted and played in the mud of the shadowy lanes.
At last he saw the tower plain against the southwest, and a huge stone bulk
rose darkly at the end of an alley. Presently he stood in a windswept open square, quaintly
cobblestoned, with a high bank wall on the farther side. This was the end of his quest; for
upon the wide, iron-railed, weed-grown plateau which the wall supported—a separate, lesser
world raised fully six feet above the surrounding streets—there stood a grim, titan bulk
whose identity, despite Blake’s new perspective, was beyond dispute.
The vacant church was in a state of great decrepitude. Some of the high stone
buttresses had fallen, and several delicate finials lay half lost among the brown, neglected
weeds and grasses. The sooty Gothic windows were largely unbroken, though many of the stone
mullions were missing. Blake wondered how the obscurely painted panes could have survived so
well, in view of the known habits of small boys the world over. The massive doors were intact
and tightly closed. Around the top of the bank wall, fully enclosing the grounds, was a rusty
iron fence whose gate—at the head of a flight of steps from the square—was visibly
padlocked. The path from the gate to the building was completely overgrown. Desolation and decay
hung like a pall above the place, and in the birdless eaves and black, ivyless walls Blake felt
a touch of the dimly sinister beyond his power to define.
There were very few people in the square, but Blake saw a policeman at the
northerly end and approached him with questions about the church. He was a great wholesome Irishman,
and it seemed odd that he would do little more than make the sign of the cross and mutter that
people never spoke of that building. When Blake pressed him he said very hurriedly that the
Italian priests warned everybody against it, vowing that a monstrous evil had once dwelt there
and left its mark. He himself had heard dark whispers of it from his father, who recalled certain
sounds and rumours from his boyhood.
There had been a bad sect there in the ould days—an outlaw sect that
called up awful things from some unknown gulf of night. It had taken a good priest to exorcise
what had come, though there did be those who said that merely the light could do it. If Father
O’Malley were alive there would be many the thing he could tell. But now there was nothing
to do but let it alone. It hurt nobody now, and those that owned it were dead or far away. They
had run away like rats after the threatening talk in ’77, when people began to mind the
way folks vanished now and then in the neighbourhood. Some day the city would step in and take
the property for lack of heirs, but little good would come of anybody’s touching it. Better
it be left alone for the years to topple, lest things be stirred that ought to rest forever
in their black abyss.
After the policeman had gone Blake stood staring at the sullen steepled pile.
It excited him to find that the structure seemed as sinister to others as to him, and he wondered
what grain of truth might lie behind the old tales the bluecoat had repeated. Probably they
were mere legends evoked by the evil look of the place, but even so, they were like a strange
coming to life of one of his own stories.
The afternoon sun came out from behind dispersing clouds, but seemed unable
to light up the stained, sooty walls of the old temple that towered on its high plateau. It
was odd that the green of spring had not touched the brown, withered growths in the raised,
iron-fenced yard. Blake found himself edging nearer the raised area and examining the bank wall
and rusted fence for possible avenues of ingress. There was a terrible lure about the blackened
fane which was not to be resisted. The fence had no opening near the steps, but around on the
north side were some missing bars. He could go up the steps and walk around on the narrow coping
outside the fence till he came to the gap. If the people feared the place so wildly, he would
encounter no interference.
He was on the embankment and almost inside the fence before anyone noticed
him. Then, looking down, he saw the few people in the square edging away and making the same
sign with their right hands that the shopkeeper in the avenue had made. Several windows were
slammed down, and a fat woman darted into the street and pulled some small children inside a
rickety, unpainted house. The gap in the fence was very easy to pass through, and before long
Blake found himself wading amidst the rotting, tangled growths of the deserted yard. Here and
there the worn stump of a headstone told him that there had once been burials in this field;
but that, he saw, must have been very long ago. The sheer bulk of the church was oppressive
now that he was close to it, but he conquered his mood and approached to try the three great
doors in the facade. All were securely locked, so he began a circuit of the Cyclopean building
in quest of some minor and more penetrable opening. Even then he could not be sure that he wished
to enter that haunt of desertion and shadow, yet the pull of its strangeness dragged him on
automatically.
A yawning and unprotected cellar window in the rear furnished the needed aperture.
Peering in, Blake saw a subterrene gulf of cobwebs and dust faintly litten by the western sun’s
filtered rays. Debris, old barrels, and ruined boxes and furniture of numerous sorts met his
eye, though over everything lay a shroud of dust which softened all sharp outlines. The rusted
remains of a hot-air furnace shewed that the building had been used and kept in shape as late
as mid-Victorian times.
Acting almost without conscious initiative, Blake crawled through the window
and let himself down to the dust-carpeted and debris-strown concrete floor. The vaulted cellar
was a vast one, without partitions; and in a corner far to the right, amid dense shadows, he
saw a black archway evidently leading upstairs. He felt a peculiar sense of oppression at being
actually within the great spectral building, but kept it in check as he cautiously scouted about—finding
a still-intact barrel amid the dust, and rolling it over to the open window to provide for his
exit. Then, bracing himself, he crossed the wide, cobweb-festooned space toward the arch. Half
choked with the omnipresent dust, and covered with ghostly gossamer fibres, he reached and began
to climb the worn stone steps which rose into the darkness. He had no light, but groped carefully
with his hands. After a sharp turn he felt a closed door ahead, and a little fumbling revealed
its ancient latch. It opened inward, and beyond it he saw a dimly illumined corridor lined with
worm-eaten panelling.
Once on the ground floor, Blake began exploring in a rapid fashion. All the
inner doors were unlocked, so that he freely passed from room to room. The colossal nave was
an almost eldritch place with its drifts and mountains of dust over box pews, altar, hourglass
pulpit, and sounding-board, and its titanic ropes of cobweb stretching among the pointed arches
of the gallery and entwining the clustered Gothic columns. Over all this hushed desolation played
a hideous leaden light as the declining afternoon sun sent its rays through the strange, half-blackened
panes of the great apsidal windows.
The paintings on those windows were so obscured by soot that Blake could scarcely
decipher what they had represented, but from the little he could make out he did not like them.
The designs were largely conventional, and his knowledge of obscure symbolism told him much
concerning some of the ancient patterns. The few saints depicted bore expressions distinctly
open to criticism, while one of the windows seemed to shew merely a dark space with spirals
of curious luminosity scattered about in it. Turning away from the windows, Blake noticed that
the cobwebbed cross above the altar was not of the ordinary kind, but resembled the primordial
ankh or crux ansata of shadowy Egypt.
In a rear vestry room beside the apse Blake found a rotting desk and ceiling-high
shelves of mildewed, disintegrating books. Here for the first time he received a positive shock
of objective horror, for the titles of those books told him much. They were the black, forbidden
things which most sane people have never even heard of, or have heard of only in furtive, timorous
whispers; the banned and dreaded repositories of equivocal secrets and immemorial formulae which
have trickled down the stream of time from the days of man’s youth, and the dim, fabulous
days before man was. He had himself read many of them—a Latin version of the abhorred
Necronomicon, the sinister Liber Ivonis, the infamous Cultes des Goules
of Comte d’Erlette, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, and old Ludvig Prinn’s
hellish De Vermis Mysteriis. But there were others he had known merely by reputation
or not at all—the Pnakotic Manuscripts, the Book of Dzyan, and a crumbling volume
in wholly unidentifiable characters yet with certain symbols and diagrams shudderingly recognisable
to the occult student. Clearly, the lingering local rumours had not lied. This place had once
been the seat of an evil older than mankind and wider than the known universe.
In the ruined desk was a small leather-bound record-book filled with entries
in some odd cryptographic medium. The manuscript writing consisted of the common traditional
symbols used today in astronomy and anciently in alchemy, astrology, and other dubious arts—the
devices of the sun, moon, planets, aspects, and zodiacal signs—here massed in solid pages
of text, with divisions and paragraphings suggesting that each symbol answered to some alphabetical
letter.
In the hope of later solving the cryptogram, Blake bore off this volume in
his coat pocket. Many of the great tomes on the shelves fascinated him unutterably, and he felt
tempted to borrow them at some later time. He wondered how they could have remained undisturbed
so long. Was he the first to conquer the clutching, pervasive fear which had for nearly sixty
years protected this deserted place from visitors?
Having now thoroughly explored the ground floor, Blake ploughed again through
the dust of the spectral nave to the front vestibule, where he had seen a door and staircase
presumably leading up to the blackened tower and steeple—objects so long familiar to him
at a distance. The ascent was a choking experience, for dust lay thick, while the spiders had
done their worst in this constricted place. The staircase was a spiral with high, narrow wooden
treads, and now and then Blake passed a clouded window looking dizzily out over the city. Though
he had seen no ropes below, he expected to find a bell or peal of bells in the tower whose narrow,
louver-boarded lancet windows his field-glass had studied so often. Here he was doomed to disappointment;
for when he attained the top of the stairs he found the tower chamber vacant of chimes, and
clearly devoted to vastly different purposes.
The room, about fifteen feet square, was faintly lighted by four lancet windows,
one on each side, which were glazed within their screening of decayed louver-boards. These had
been further fitted with tight, opaque screens, but the latter were now largely rotted away.
In the centre of the dust-laden floor rose a curiously angled stone pillar some four feet in
height and two in average diameter, covered on each side with bizarre, crudely incised, and
wholly unrecognisable hieroglyphs. On this pillar rested a metal box of peculiarly asymmetrical
form; its hinged lid thrown back, and its interior holding what looked beneath the decade-deep
dust to be an egg-shaped or irregularly spherical object some four inches through. Around the
pillar in a rough circle were seven high-backed Gothic chairs still largely intact, while behind
them, ranging along the dark-panelled walls, were seven colossal images of crumbling, black-painted
plaster, resembling more than anything else the cryptic carven megaliths of mysterious Easter
Island. In one corner of the cobwebbed chamber a ladder was built into the wall, leading up
to the closed trap-door of the windowless steeple above.
As Blake grew accustomed to the feeble light he noticed odd bas-reliefs on
the strange open box of yellowish metal. Approaching, he tried to clear the dust away with his
hands and handkerchief, and saw that the figurings were of a monstrous and utterly alien kind;
depicting entities which, though seemingly alive, resembled no known life-form ever evolved
on this planet. The four-inch seeming sphere turned out to be a nearly black, red-striated polyhedron
with many irregular flat surfaces; either a very remarkable crystal of some sort, or an artificial
object of carved and highly polished mineral matter. It did not touch the bottom of the box,
but was held suspended by means of a metal band around its centre, with seven queerly designed
supports extending horizontally to angles of the box’s inner wall near the top. This stone,
once exposed, exerted upon Blake an almost alarming fascination. He could scarcely tear his
eyes from it, and as he looked at its glistening surfaces he almost fancied it was transparent,
with half-formed worlds of wonder within. Into his mind floated pictures of alien orbs with
great stone towers, and other orbs with titan mountains and no mark of life, and still remoter
spaces where only a stirring in vague blacknesses told of the presence of consciousness and
will.
When he did look away, it was to notice a somewhat singular mound of dust in
the far corner near the ladder to the steeple. Just why it took his attention he could not tell,
but something in its contours carried a message to his unconscious mind. Ploughing toward it,
and brushing aside the hanging cobwebs as he went, he began to discern something grim about
it. Hand and handkerchief soon revealed the truth, and Blake gasped with a baffling mixture
of emotions. It was a human skeleton, and it must have been there for a very long time. The
clothing was in shreds, but some buttons and fragments of cloth bespoke a man’s grey suit.
There were other bits of evidence—shoes, metal clasps, huge buttons for round cuffs, a
stickpin of bygone pattern, a reporter’s badge with the name of the old Providence
Telegram, and a crumbling leather pocketbook. Blake examined the latter with care, finding
within it several bills of antiquated issue, a celluloid advertising calendar for 1893, some
cards with the name “Edwin M. Lillibridge”, and a paper covered with pencilled memoranda.
This paper held much of a puzzling nature, and Blake read it carefully at the
dim westward window. Its disjointed text included such phrases as the following:
“Prof. Enoch Bowen home from Egypt May 1844—buys old Free-Will Church
in July—his archaeological work & studies in occult well known.”
“Dr. Drowne of 4th Baptist warns against Starry Wisdom in sermon Dec.
29, 1844.”
“Congregation 97 by end of ’45.”
“1846—3 disappearances—first mention of Shining Trapezohedron.”
“7 disappearances 1848—stories of blood sacrifice begin.”
“Investigation 1853 comes to nothing—stories of sounds.”
“Fr. O’Malley tells of devil-worship with box found in great Egyptian
ruins—says they call up something that can’t exist in light. Flees a little light,
and banished by strong light. Then has to be summoned again. Probably got this from deathbed
confession of Francis X. Feeney, who had joined Starry Wisdom in ’49. These people say
the Shining Trapezohedron shews them heaven & other worlds, & that the Haunter of the
Dark tells them secrets in some way.”
“Story of Orrin B. Eddy 1857. They call it up by gazing at the crystal,
& have a secret language of their own.”
“200 or more in cong. 1863, exclusive of men at front.”
“Irish boys mob church in 1869 after Patrick Regan’s disappearance.”
“Veiled article in J. March 14, ’72, but people don’t talk
about it.”
“6 disappearances 1876—secret committee calls on Mayor Doyle.”
“Action promised Feb. 1877—church closes in April.”
“Gang—Federal Hill Boys—threaten Dr. —— and vestrymen
in May.”
“181 persons leave city before end of ’77—mention no names.”
“Ghost stories begin around 1880—try to ascertain truth of report
that no human being has entered church since 1877.”
“Ask Lanigan for photograph of place taken 1851.” . . .
Restoring the paper to the pocketbook and placing the latter in his coat, Blake
turned to look down at the skeleton in the dust. The implications of the notes were clear, and
there could be no doubt but that this man had come to the deserted edifice forty-two years before
in quest of a newspaper sensation which no one else had been bold enough to attempt. Perhaps
no one else had known of his plan—who could tell? But he had never returned to his paper.
Had some bravely suppressed fear risen to overcome him and bring on sudden heart-failure? Blake
stooped over the gleaming bones and noted their peculiar state. Some of them were badly scattered,
and a few seemed oddly dissolved at the ends. Others were strangely yellowed, with vague
suggestions of charring. This charring extended to some of the fragments of clothing. The skull
was in a very peculiar state—stained yellow, and with a charred aperture in the top as
if some powerful acid had eaten through the solid bone. What had happened to the skeleton during
its four decades of silent entombment here Blake could not imagine.
Before he realised it, he was looking at the stone again, and letting its curious
influence call up a nebulous pageantry in his mind. He saw processions of robed, hooded figures
whose outlines were not human, and looked on endless leagues of desert lined with carved, sky-reaching
monoliths. He saw towers and walls in nighted depths under the sea, and vortices of space where
wisps of black mist floated before thin shimmerings of cold purple haze. And beyond all else
he glimpsed an infinite gulf of darkness, where solid and semi-solid forms were known only by
their windy stirrings, and cloudy patterns of force seemed to superimpose order on chaos and
hold forth a key to all the paradoxes and arcana of the worlds we know.
Then all at once the spell was broken by an access of gnawing, indeterminate
panic fear. Blake choked and turned away from the stone, conscious of some formless alien presence
close to him and watching him with horrible intentness. He felt entangled with something—something
which was not in the stone, but which had looked through it at him—something which would
ceaselessly follow him with a cognition that was not physical sight. Plainly, the place was
getting on his nerves—as well it might in view of his gruesome find. The light was waning,
too, and since he had no illuminant with him he knew he would have to be leaving soon.
It was then, in the gathering twilight, that he thought he saw a faint trace
of luminosity in the crazily angled stone. He had tried to look away from it, but some obscure
compulsion drew his eyes back. Was there a subtle phosphorescence of radio-activity about the
thing? What was it that the dead man’s notes had said concerning a Shining Trapezohedron?
What, anyway, was this abandoned lair of cosmic evil? What had been done here, and what might
still be lurking in the bird-shunned shadows? It seemed now as if an elusive touch of foetor
had arisen somewhere close by, though its source was not apparent. Blake seized the cover of
the long-open box and snapped it down. It moved easily on its alien hinges, and closed completely
over the unmistakably glowing stone.
At the sharp click of that closing a soft stirring sound seemed to come from
the steeple’s eternal blackness overhead, beyond the trap-door. Rats, without question—the
only living things to reveal their presence in this accursed pile since he had entered it. And
yet that stirring in the steeple frightened him horribly, so that he plunged almost wildly down
the spiral stairs, across the ghoulish nave, into the vaulted basement, out amidst the gathering
dusk of the deserted square, and down through the teeming, fear-haunted alleys and avenues of
Federal Hill toward the sane central streets and the home-like brick sidewalks of the college
district.
During the days which followed, Blake told no one of his expedition. Instead,
he read much in certain books, examined long years of newspaper files downtown, and worked feverishly
at the cryptogram in that leather volume from the cobwebbed vestry room. The cipher, he soon
saw, was no simple one; and after a long period of endeavour he felt sure that its language
could not be English, Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, or German. Evidently he would
have to draw upon the deepest wells of his strange erudition.
Every evening the old impulse to gaze westward returned, and he saw the black
steeple as of yore amongst the bristling roofs of a distant and half-fabulous world. But now
it held a fresh note of terror for him. He knew the heritage of evil lore it masked, and with
the knowledge his vision ran riot in queer new ways. The birds of spring were returning, and
as he watched their sunset flights he fancied they avoided the gaunt, lone spire as never before.
When a flock of them approached it, he thought, they would wheel and scatter in panic confusion—and
he could guess at the wild twitterings which failed to reach him across the intervening miles.
It was in June that Blake’s diary told of his victory over the cryptogram.
The text was, he found, in the dark Aklo language used by certain cults of evil antiquity, and
known to him in a halting way through previous researches. The diary is strangely reticent about
what Blake deciphered, but he was patently awed and disconcerted by his results. There are references
to a Haunter of the Dark awaked by gazing into the Shining Trapezohedron, and insane conjectures
about the black gulfs of chaos from which it was called. The being is spoken of as holding all
knowledge, and demanding monstrous sacrifices. Some of Blake’s entries shew fear lest
the thing, which he seemed to regard as summoned, stalk abroad; though he adds that the street-lights
form a bulwark which cannot be crossed.
Of the Shining Trapezohedron he speaks often, calling it a window on all time
and space, and tracing its history from the days it was fashioned on dark Yuggoth, before ever
the Old Ones brought it to earth. It was treasured and placed in its curious box by the crinoid
things of Antarctica, salvaged from their ruins by the serpent-men of Valusia, and peered at
aeons later in Lemuria by the first human beings. It crossed strange lands and stranger seas,
and sank with Atlantis before a Minoan fisher meshed it in his net and sold it to swarthy merchants
from nighted Khem. The Pharaoh Nephren-Ka built around it a temple with a windowless crypt,
and did that which caused his name to be stricken from all monuments and records. Then it slept
in the ruins of that evil fane which the priests and the new Pharaoh destroyed, till the delver’s
spade once more brought it forth to curse mankind.
Early in July the newspapers oddly supplement Blake’s entries, though
in so brief and casual a way that only the diary has called general attention to their contribution.
It appears that a new fear had been growing on Federal Hill since a stranger had entered the
dreaded church. The Italians whispered of unaccustomed stirrings and bumpings and scrapings
in the dark windowless steeple, and called on their priests to banish an entity which haunted
their dreams. Something, they said, was constantly watching at a door to see if it were dark
enough to venture forth. Press items mentioned the long-standing local superstitions, but failed
to shed much light on the earlier background of the horror. It was obvious that the young reporters
of today are no antiquarians. In writing of these things in his diary, Blake expresses a curious
kind of remorse, and talks of the duty of burying the Shining Trapezohedron and of banishing
what he had evoked by letting daylight into the hideous jutting spire. At the same time, however,
he displays the dangerous extent of his fascination, and admits a morbid longing—pervading
even his dreams—to visit the accursed tower and gaze again into the cosmic secrets of
the glowing stone.
Then something in the Journal on the morning of July 17 threw the diarist
into a veritable fever of horror. It was only a variant of the other half-humorous items about
the Federal Hill restlessness, but to Blake it was somehow very terrible indeed. In the night
a thunderstorm had put the city’s lighting-system out of commission for a full hour, and
in that black interval the Italians had nearly gone mad with fright. Those living near the dreaded
church had sworn that the thing in the steeple had taken advantage of the street-lamps’
absence and gone down into the body of the church, flopping and bumping around in a viscous,
altogether dreadful way. Toward the last it had bumped up to the tower, where there were sounds
of the shattering of glass. It could go wherever the darkness reached, but light would always
send it fleeing.
When the current blazed on again there had been a shocking commotion in the
tower, for even the feeble light trickling through the grime-blackened, louver-boarded windows
was too much for the thing. It had bumped and slithered up into its tenebrous steeple just in
time—for a long dose of light would have sent it back into the abyss whence the crazy
stranger had called it. During the dark hour praying crowds had clustered round the church in
the rain with lighted candles and lamps somehow shielded with folded paper and umbrellas—a
guard of light to save the city from the nightmare that stalks in darkness. Once, those nearest
the church declared, the outer door had rattled hideously.
But even this was not the worst. That evening in the Bulletin Blake
read of what the reporters had found. Aroused at last to the whimsical news value of the scare,
a pair of them had defied the frantic crowds of Italians and crawled into the church through
the cellar window after trying the doors in vain. They found the dust of the vestibule and of
the spectral nave ploughed up in a singular way, with bits of rotted cushions and satin pew-linings
scattered curiously around. There was a bad odour everywhere, and here and there were bits of
yellow stain and patches of what looked like charring. Opening the door to the tower, and pausing
a moment at the suspicion of a scraping sound above, they found the narrow spiral stairs wiped
roughly clean.
In the tower itself a similarly half-swept condition existed. They spoke of
the heptagonal stone pillar, the overturned Gothic chairs, and the bizarre plaster images; though
strangely enough the metal box and the old mutilated skeleton were not mentioned. What disturbed
Blake the most—except for the hints of stains and charring and bad odours—was the
final detail that explained the crashing glass. Every one of the tower’s lancet windows
was broken, and two of them had been darkened in a crude and hurried way by the stuffing of
satin pew-linings and cushion-horsehair into the spaces between the slanting exterior louver-boards.
More satin fragments and bunches of horsehair lay scattered around the newly swept floor, as
if someone had been interrupted in the act of restoring the tower to the absolute blackness
of its tightly curtained days.
Yellowish stains and charred patches were found on the ladder to the windowless
spire, but when a reporter climbed up, opened the horizontally sliding trap-door, and shot a
feeble flashlight beam into the black and strangely foetid space, he saw nothing but darkness,
and an heterogeneous litter of shapeless fragments near the aperture. The verdict, of course,
was charlatanry. Somebody had played a joke on the superstitious hill-dwellers, or else some
fanatic had striven to bolster up their fears for their own supposed good. Or perhaps some of
the younger and more sophisticated dwellers had staged an elaborate hoax on the outside world.
There was an amusing aftermath when the police sent an officer to verify the reports. Three
men in succession found ways of evading the assignment, and the fourth went very reluctantly
and returned very soon without adding to the account given by the reporters.
From this point onward Blake’s diary shews a mounting tide of insidious
horror and nervous apprehension. He upbraids himself for not doing something, and speculates
wildly on the consequences of another electrical breakdown. It has been verified that on three
occasions—during thunderstorms—he telephoned the electric light company in a frantic
vein and asked that desperate precautions against a lapse of power be taken. Now and then his
entries shew concern over the failure of the reporters to find the metal box and stone, and
the strangely marred old skeleton, when they explored the shadowy tower room. He assumed that
these things had been removed—whither, and by whom or what, he could only guess. But his
worst fears concerned himself, and the kind of unholy rapport he felt to exist between his mind
and that lurking horror in the distant steeple—that monstrous thing of night which his
rashness had called out of the ultimate black spaces. He seemed to feel a constant tugging at
his will, and callers of that period remember how he would sit abstractedly at his desk and
stare out of the west window at that far-off, spire-bristling mound beyond the swirling smoke
of the city. His entries dwell monotonously on certain terrible dreams, and of a strengthening
of the unholy rapport in his sleep. There is mention of a night when he awaked to find himself
fully dressed, outdoors, and headed automatically down College Hill toward the west. Again and
again he dwells on the fact that the thing in the steeple knows where to find him.
The week following July 30 is recalled as the time of Blake’s partial
breakdown. He did not dress, and ordered all his food by telephone. Visitors remarked the cords
he kept near his bed, and he said that sleep-walking had forced him to bind his ankles every
night with knots which would probably hold or else waken him with the labour of untying.
In his diary he told of the hideous experience which had brought the collapse.
After retiring on the night of the 30th he had suddenly found himself groping about in an almost
black space. All he could see were short, faint, horizontal streaks of bluish light, but he
could smell an overpowering foetor and hear a curious jumble of soft, furtive sounds above him.
Whenever he moved he stumbled over something, and at each noise there would come a sort of answering
sound from above—a vague stirring, mixed with the cautious sliding of wood on wood.
Once his groping hands encountered a pillar of stone with a vacant top, whilst
later he found himself clutching the rungs of a ladder built into the wall, and fumbling his
uncertain way upward toward some region of intenser stench where a hot, searing blast beat down
against him. Before his eyes a kaleidoscopic range of phantasmal images played, all of them
dissolving at intervals into the picture of a vast, unplumbed abyss of night wherein whirled
suns and worlds of an even profounder blackness. He thought of the ancient legends of Ultimate
Chaos, at whose centre sprawls the blind idiot god Azathoth, Lord of All Things, encircled by
his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers, and lulled by the thin monotonous piping
of a daemoniac flute held in nameless paws.
Then a sharp report from the outer world broke through his stupor and roused
him to the unutterable horror of his position. What it was, he never knew—perhaps it was
some belated peal from the fireworks heard all summer on Federal Hill as the dwellers hail their
various patron saints, or the saints of their native villages in Italy. In any event he shrieked
aloud, dropped frantically from the ladder, and stumbled blindly across the obstructed floor
of the almost lightless chamber that encompassed him.
He knew instantly where he was, and plunged recklessly down the narrow spiral
staircase, tripping and bruising himself at every turn. There was a nightmare flight through
a vast cobwebbed nave whose ghostly arches reached up to realms of leering shadow, a sightless
scramble through a littered basement, a climb to regions of air and street-lights outside, and
a mad racing down a spectral hill of gibbering gables, across a grim, silent city of tall black
towers, and up the steep eastward precipice to his own ancient door.
On regaining consciousness in the morning he found himself lying on his study
floor fully dressed. Dirt and cobwebs covered him, and every inch of his body seemed sore and
bruised. When he faced the mirror he saw that his hair was badly scorched, while a trace of
strange, evil odour seemed to cling to his upper outer clothing. It was then that his nerves
broke down. Thereafter, lounging exhaustedly about in a dressing-gown, he did little but stare
from his west window, shiver at the threat of thunder, and make wild entries in his diary.
The great storm broke just before midnight on August 8th. Lightning struck
repeatedly in all parts of the city, and two remarkable fireballs were reported. The rain was
torrential, while a constant fusillade of thunder brought sleeplessness to thousands. Blake
was utterly frantic in his fear for the lighting system, and tried to telephone the company
around 1 a.m., though by that time service had been temporarily cut off in the interest of safety.
He recorded everything in his diary—the large, nervous, and often undecipherable hieroglyphs
telling their own story of growing frenzy and despair, and of entries scrawled blindly in the
dark.
He had to keep the house dark in order to see out the window, and it appears
that most of his time was spent at his desk, peering anxiously through the rain across the glistening
miles of downtown roofs at the constellation of distant lights marking Federal Hill. Now and
then he would fumblingly make an entry in his diary, so that detached phrases such as “The
lights must not go”; “It knows where I am”; “I must destroy it”;
and “It is calling to me, but perhaps it means no injury this time”; are found scattered
down two of the pages.
Then the lights went out all over the city. It happened at 2:12 a.m. according
to power-house records, but Blake’s diary gives no indication of the time. The entry is
merely, “Lights out—God help me.” On Federal Hill there were watchers as anxious
as he, and rain-soaked knots of men paraded the square and alleys around the evil church with
umbrella-shaded candles, electric flashlights, oil lanterns, crucifixes, and obscure charms
of the many sorts common to southern Italy. They blessed each flash of lightning, and made cryptical
signs of fear with their right hands when a turn in the storm caused the flashes to lessen and
finally to cease altogether. A rising wind blew out most of the candles, so that the scene grew
threateningly dark. Someone roused Father Merluzzo of Spirito Santo Church, and he hastened
to the dismal square to pronounce whatever helpful syllables he could. Of the restless and curious
sounds in the blackened tower, there could be no doubt whatever.
For what happened at 2:35 we have the testimony of the priest, a young, intelligent,
and well-educated person; of Patrolman William J. Monahan of the Central Station, an officer
of the highest reliability who had paused at that part of his beat to inspect the crowd; and
of most of the seventy-eight men who had gathered around the church’s high bank wall—especially
those in the square where the eastward facade was visible. Of course there was nothing which
can be proved as being outside the order of Nature. The possible causes of such an event are
many. No one can speak with certainty of the obscure chemical processes arising in a vast, ancient,
ill-aired, and long-deserted building of heterogeneous contents. Mephitic vapours—spontaneous
combustion—pressure of gases born of long decay—any one of numberless phenomena
might be responsible. And then, of course, the factor of conscious charlatanry can by no means
be excluded. The thing was really quite simple in itself, and covered less than three minutes
of actual time. Father Merluzzo, always a precise man, looked at his watch repeatedly.
It started with a definite swelling of the dull fumbling sounds inside the
black tower. There had for some time been a vague exhalation of strange, evil odours from the
church, and this had now become emphatic and offensive. Then at last there was a sound of splintering
wood, and a large, heavy object crashed down in the yard beneath the frowning easterly facade.
The tower was invisible now that the candles would not burn, but as the object neared the ground
the people knew that it was the smoke-grimed louver-boarding of that tower’s east window.
Immediately afterward an utterly unbearable foetor welled forth from the unseen
heights, choking and sickening the trembling watchers, and almost prostrating those in the square.
At the same time the air trembled with a vibration as of flapping wings, and a sudden east-blowing
wind more violent than any previous blast snatched off the hats and wrenched the dripping umbrellas
of the crowd. Nothing definite could be seen in the candleless night, though some upward-looking
spectators thought they glimpsed a great spreading blur of denser blackness against the inky
sky—something like a formless cloud of smoke that shot with meteor-like speed toward the
east.
That was all. The watchers were half numbed with fright, awe, and discomfort,
and scarcely knew what to do, or whether to do anything at all. Not knowing what had happened,
they did not relax their vigil; and a moment later they sent up a prayer as a sharp flash of
belated lightning, followed by an earsplitting crash of sound, rent the flooded heavens. Half
an hour later the rain stopped, and in fifteen minutes more the street-lights sprang on again,
sending the weary, bedraggled watchers relievedly back to their homes.
The next day’s papers gave these matters minor mention in connexion with
the general storm reports. It seems that the great lightning flash and deafening explosion which
followed the Federal Hill occurrence were even more tremendous farther east, where a burst of
the singular foetor was likewise noticed. The phenomenon was most marked over College Hill,
where the crash awaked all the sleeping inhabitants and led to a bewildered round of speculations.
Of those who were already awake only a few saw the anomalous blaze of light near the top of
the hill, or noticed the inexplicable upward rush of air which almost stripped the leaves from
the trees and blasted the plants in the gardens. It was agreed that the lone, sudden lightning-bolt
must have struck somewhere in this neighbourhood, though no trace of its striking could afterward
be found. A youth in the Tau Omega fraternity house thought he saw a grotesque and hideous mass
of smoke in the air just as the preliminary flash burst, but his observation has not been verified.
All of the few observers, however, agree as to the violent gust from the west and the flood
of intolerable stench which preceded the belated stroke; whilst evidence concerning the momentary
burned odour after the stroke is equally general.
These points were discussed very carefully because of their probable connexion
with the death of Robert Blake. Students in the Psi Delta house, whose upper rear windows looked
into Blake’s study, noticed the blurred white face at the westward window on the morning
of the 9th, and wondered what was wrong with the expression. When they saw the same face in
the same position that evening, they felt worried, and watched for the lights to come up in
his apartment. Later they rang the bell of the darkened flat, and finally had a policeman force
the door.
The rigid body sat bolt upright at the desk by the window, and when the intruders
saw the glassy, bulging eyes, and the marks of stark, convulsive fright on the twisted features,
they turned away in sickened dismay. Shortly afterward the coroner’s physician made an
examination, and despite the unbroken window reported electrical shock, or nervous tension induced
by electrical discharge, as the cause of death. The hideous expression he ignored altogether,
deeming it a not improbable result of the profound shock as experienced by a person of such
abnormal imagination and unbalanced emotions. He deduced these latter qualities from the books,
paintings, and manuscripts found in the apartment, and from the blindly scrawled entries in
the diary on the desk. Blake had prolonged his frenzied jottings to the last, and the broken-pointed
pencil was found clutched in his spasmodically contracted right hand.
The entries after the failure of the lights were highly disjointed, and legible
only in part. From them certain investigators have drawn conclusions differing greatly from
the materialistic official verdict, but such speculations have little chance for belief among
the conservative. The case of these imaginative theorists has not been helped by the action
of superstitious Dr. Dexter, who threw the curious box and angled stone—an object certainly
self-luminous as seen in the black windowless steeple where it was found—into the deepest
channel of Narragansett Bay. Excessive imagination and neurotic unbalance on Blake’s part,
aggravated by knowledge of the evil bygone cult whose startling traces he had uncovered, form
the dominant interpretation given those final frenzied jottings. These are the entries—or
all that can be made of them.

“Lights still out—must be five minutes now. Everything depends
on lightning. Yaddith grant it will keep up! . . . Some influence seems beating through
it. . . . Rain and thunder and wind deafen. . . . The thing is
taking hold of my mind. . . .
“Trouble with memory. I see things I never knew before. Other worlds
and other galaxies . . . Dark . . . The lightning seems dark and
the darkness seems light. . . .
“It cannot be the real hill and church that I see in the pitch-darkness.
Must be retinal impression left by flashes. Heaven grant the Italians are out with their candles
if the lightning stops!
“What am I afraid of? Is it not an avatar of Nyarlathotep, who in antique
and shadowy Khem even took the form of man? I remember Yuggoth, and more distant Shaggai, and
the ultimate void of the black planets. . . .
“The long, winging flight through the void . . . cannot
cross the universe of light . . . re-created by the thoughts caught in the Shining
Trapezohedron . . . send it through the horrible abysses of radiance. . . .
“My name is Blake—Robert Harrison Blake of 620 East Knapp Street,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. . . . I am on this planet. . . .
“Azathoth have mercy!—the lightning no longer flashes—horrible—I
can see everything with a monstrous sense that is not sight—light is dark and dark is
light . . . those people on the hill . . . guard . . .
candles and charms . . . their priests. . . .
“Sense of distance gone—far is near and near is far. No light—no
glass—see that steeple—that tower—window—can hear—Roderick Usher—am
mad or going mad—the thing is stirring and fumbling in the tower—I am it and it
is I—I want to get out . . . must get out and unify the forces. . . .
It knows where I am. . . .
“I am Robert Blake, but I see the tower in the dark. There is a monstrous
odour . . . senses transfigured . . . boarding at that tower window
cracking and giving way. . . . Iä . . . ngai . . .
ygg. . . .
“I see it—coming here—hell-wind—titan blur—black
wings—Yog-Sothoth save me—the three-lobed burning eye. . . .”",the haunter of the dark,HP Lovecraft
