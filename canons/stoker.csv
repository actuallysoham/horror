"FORE-GLIMPSE


'I would rather be an angel than God!'

The voice of the speaker sounded clearly through the hawthorn tree.
The young man and the young girl who sat together on the low
tombstone looked at each other.  They had heard the voices of the two
children talking, but had not noticed what they said; it was the
sentiment, not the sound, which roused their attention.

The girl put her finger to her lips to impress silence, and the man
nodded; they sat as still as mice whilst the two children went on
talking.


The scene would have gladdened a painter's heart.  An old churchyard.
The church low and square-towered, with long mullioned windows, the
yellow-grey stone roughened by age and tender-hued with lichens.
Round it clustered many tombstones tilted in all directions.  Behind
the church a line of gnarled and twisted yews.

The churchyard was full of fine trees.  On one side a magnificent
cedar; on the other a great copper beech.  Here and there among the
tombs and headstones many beautiful blossoming trees rose from the
long green grass.  The laburnum glowed in the June afternoon
sunlight; the lilac, the hawthorn and the clustering meadowsweet
which fringed the edge of the lazy stream mingled their heavy
sweetness in sleepy fragrance.  The yellow-grey crumbling walls were
green in places with wrinkled harts-tongues, and were topped with
sweet-williams and spreading house-leek and stone-crop and wild-
flowers whose delicious sweetness made for the drowsy repose of
perfect summer.

But amid all that mass of glowing colour the two young figures seated
on the grey old tomb stood out conspicuously.  The man was in
conventional hunting-dress:  red coat, white stock, black hat, white
breeches, and top-boots.  The girl was one of the richest, most
glowing, and yet withal daintiest figures the eye of man could linger
on.  She was in riding-habit of hunting scarlet cloth; her black hat
was tipped forward by piled-up masses red-golden hair.  Round her
neck was a white lawn scarf in the fashion of a man's hunting-stock,
close fitting, and sinking into a gold-buttoned waistcoat of snowy
twill.  As she sat with the long skirt across her left arm her tiny
black top-boots appeared underneath.  Her gauntleted gloves were of
white buckskin; her riding-whip was plaited of white leather, topped
with ivory and banded with gold.

Even in her fourteenth year Miss Stephen Norman gave promise of
striking beauty; beauty of a rarely composite character.  In her the
various elements of her race seemed to have cropped out.  The firm-
set jaw, with chin broader and more square than is usual in a woman,
and the wide fine forehead and aquiline nose marked the high descent
from Saxon through Norman.  The glorious mass of red hair, of the
true flame colour, showed the blood of another ancient ancestor of
Northern race, and suited well with the voluptuous curves of the
full, crimson lips.  The purple-black eyes, the raven eyebrows and
eyelashes, and the fine curve of the nostrils spoke of the Eastern
blood of the far-back wife of the Crusader.  Already she was tall for
her age, with something of that lankiness which marks the early
development of a really fine figure.  Long-legged, long-necked, as
straight as a lance, with head poised on the proud neck like a lily
on its stem.

Stephen Norman certainly gave promise of a splendid womanhood.
Pride, self-reliance and dominance were marked in every feature; in
her bearing and in her lightest movement.

Her companion, Harold An Wolf, was some five years her senior, and by
means of those five years and certain qualities had long stood in the
position of her mentor.  He was more than six feet two in height,
deep-chested, broad-shouldered, lean-flanked, long-armed and big-
handed.  He had that appearance strength, with well-poised neck and
forward set of the head, which marks the successful athlete.

The two sat quiet, listening.  Through the quiet hum of afternoon
came the voices of the two children.  Outside the lich-gate, under
the shade of the spreading cedar, the horses stamped occasionally as
the flies troubled them.  The grooms were mounted; one held the
delicate-limbed white Arab, the other the great black horse.

'I would rather be an angel than God!'

The little girl who made the remark was an ideal specimen of the
village Sunday-school child.  Blue-eyed, rosy-cheeked, thick-legged,
with her straight brown hair tied into a hard bunch with a much-
creased, cherry-coloured ribbon.  A glance at the girl would have
satisfied the most sceptical as to her goodness.  Without being in
any way smug she was radiant with self-satisfaction and well-doing.
A child of the people; an early riser; a help to her mother; a good
angel to her father; a little mother to her brothers and sisters;
cleanly in mind and body; self-reliant, full of faith, cheerful.

The other little girl was prettier, but of a more stubborn type; more
passionate, less organised, and infinitely more assertive.  Black-
haired, black-eyed, swarthy, large-mouthed, snub-nosed; the very type
and essence of unrestrained, impulsive, emotional, sensual nature.  A
seeing eye would have noted inevitable danger for the early years of
her womanhood.  She seemed amazed by the self-abnegation implied by
her companion's statement; after a pause she replied:

'I wouldn't!  I'd rather be up at the top of everything and give
orders to the angels if I chose.  I can't think, Marjorie, why you'd
rather take orders than give them.'

'That's just it, Susan.  I don't want to give orders; I'd rather obey
them.  It must be very terrible to have to think of things so much,
that you want everything done your own way.  And besides, I shouldn't
like to have to be just!'

'Why not?' the voice was truculent, though there was wistfulness in
it also.

'Oh Susan.  Just fancy having to punish; for of course justice needs
punishing as well as praising.  Now an angel has such a nice time,
helping people and comforting them, and bringing sunshine into dark
places.  Putting down fresh dew every morning; making the flowers
grow, and bringing babies and taking care of them till their mothers
find them.  Of course God is very good and very sweet and very
merciful, but oh, He must be very terrible.'

'All the same I would rather be God and able to do things!'

Then the children moved off out of earshot.  The two seated on the
tombstone looked after them.  The first to speak was the girl, who
said:

'That's very sweet and good of Marjorie; but do you know, Harold, I
like Susie's idea better.'

'Which idea was that, Stephen?'

'Why, didn't you notice what she said:  ""I'd like to be God and be
able to do things""?'

'Yes,' he said after a moment's reflection.  'That's a fine idea in
the abstract; but I doubt of its happiness in the long-run.'

'Doubt of its happiness?  Come now? what could there be better, after
all?  Isn't it good enough to be God?  What more do you want?'

The girl's tone was quizzical, but her great black eyes blazed with
some thought of sincerity which lay behind the fun.  The young man
shook his head with a smile of kindly tolerance as he answered:

'It isn't that--surely you must know it.  I'm ambitious enough,
goodness knows; but there are bounds to satisfy even me.  But I'm not
sure that the good little thing isn't right.  She seemed, somehow, to
hit a bigger truth than she knew:  ""fancy having to be just.""'

'I don't see much difficulty in that.  Anyone can be just!'

'Pardon me,' he answered, 'there is perhaps nothing so difficult in
the whole range of a man's work.'  There was distinct defiance in the
girl's eyes as she asked:

'A man's work!  Why a man's work?  Isn't it a woman's work also?'

'Well, I suppose it ought to be, theoretically; practically it
isn't.'

'And why not, pray?'  The mere suggestion of any disability of woman
as such aroused immediate antagonism.  Her companion suppressed a
smile as he answered deliberately:

'Because, my dear Stephen, the Almighty has ordained that justice is
not a virtue women can practise.  Mind, I do not say women are
unjust.  Far from it, where there are no interests of those dear to
them they can be of a sincerity of justice that can make a man's
blood run cold.  But justice in the abstract is not an ordinary
virtue:  it has to be considerate as well as stern, and above all
interest of all kinds and of every one--'  The girl interrupted
hotly:

'I don't agree with you at all.  You can't give an instance where
women are unjust.  I don't mean of course individual instances, but
classes of cases where injustice is habitual.'  The suppressed smile
cropped out now unconsciously round the man's lips in a way which was
intensely aggravating to the girl.

'I'll give you a few,' he said.  'Did you ever know a mother just to
a boy who beat her own boy at school?'  The girl replied quietly:

'Ill-treatment and bullying are subjects for punishment, not
justice.'

'Oh, I don't mean that kind of beating.  I mean getting the prizes
their own boys contended for; getting above them in class; showing
superior powers in running or cricket or swimming, or in any of the
forms of effort in which boys vie with each other.'  The girl
reflected, then she spoke:

'Well, you may be right.  I don't altogether admit it, but I accept
it as not on my side.  But this is only one case.'

'A pretty common one.  Do you think that Sheriff of Galway, who in
default of a hangman hanged his son with his own hands, would have
done so if he had been a woman?'  The girl answered at once:

'Frankly, no.  I don't suppose the mother was ever born who would do
such a thing.  But that is not a common case, is it?  Have you any
other?'  The young man paused before he spoke:

'There is another, but I don't think I can go into it fairly with
you.'

'Why not?'

'Well, because after all you know, Stephen, you are only a girl and
you can't be expected to know.'  The girl laughed:

'Well, if it's anything about women surely a girl, even of my tender
age, must know something more of it, or be able to guess at, than any
young man can.  However, say what you think and I'll tell you frankly
if I agree--that is if a woman can be just, in such a matter.'

'Shortly the point is this:  Can a woman be just to another woman, or
to a man for the matter of that, where either her own affection or a
fault of the other is concerned?'

'I don't see any reason to the contrary.  Surely pride alone should
ensure justice in the former case, and the consciousness of
superiority in the other.'  The young man shook his head:

'Pride and the consciousness of superiority!  Are they not much the
same thing.  But whether or no, if either of them has to be relied
on, I'm afraid the scales of Justice would want regulating, and her
sword should be blunted in case its edge should be turned back on
herself.  I have an idea that although pride might be a guiding
principle with you individually, it would be a failure with the
average.  However, as it would be in any case a rule subject to many
exceptions I must let it go.'

Harold looked at his watch and rose.  Stephen followed him;
transferring her whip into the hand which held up the skirt, she took
his arm with her right hand in the pretty way in which a young girl
clings to her elders.  Together they went out at the lich-gate.  The
groom drew over with the horses.  Stephen patted hers and gave her a
lump of sugar.  Then putting her foot into Harold's ready hand she
sprang lightly into the saddle.  Harold swung himself into his saddle
with the dexterity of an accomplished rider.

As the two rode up the road, keeping on the shady side under the
trees, Stephen said quietly, half to herself, as if the sentence had
impressed itself on her mind:

'To be God and able to do things!'

Harold rode on in silence.  The chill of some vague fear was upon
him.



CHAPTER I--STEPHEN



Stephen Norman of Normanstand had remained a bachelor until close on
middle age, when the fact took hold of him that there was no
immediate heir to his great estate.  Whereupon, with his wonted
decision, he set about looking for a wife.

He had been a close friend of his next neighbour, Squire Rowly, ever
since their college days.  They had, of course, been often in each
other's houses, and Rowly's young sister--almost a generation younger
than himself, and the sole fruit of his father's second marriage--had
been like a little sister to him too.  She had, in the twenty years
which had elapsed, grown to be a sweet and beautiful young woman.  In
all the past years, with the constant opportunity which friendship
gave of close companionship, the feeling never altered.  Squire
Norman would have been surprised had he been asked to describe
Margaret Rowly and found himself compelled to present the picture of
a woman, not a child.

Now, however, when his thoughts went womanward and wifeward, he awoke
to the fact that Margaret came within the category of those he
sought.  His usual decision ran its course.  Semi-brotherly feeling
gave place to a stronger and perhaps more selfish feeling.  Before he
even knew it, he was head over ears in love with his pretty
neighbour.

Norman was a fine man, stalwart and handsome; his forty years sat so
lightly on him that his age never seemed to come into question in a
woman's mind.  Margaret had always liked him and trusted him; he was
the big brother who had no duty in the way of scolding to do.  His
presence had always been a gladness; and the sex of the girl, first
unconsciously then consciously, answered to the man's overtures, and
her consent was soon obtained.

When in the fulness of time it was known that an heir was expected,
Squire Norman took for granted that the child would be a boy, and
held the idea so tenaciously that his wife, who loved him deeply,
gave up warning and remonstrance after she had once tried to caution
him against too fond a hope.  She saw how bitterly he would be
disappointed in case it should prove to be a girl.  He was, however,
so fixed on the point that she determined to say no more.  After all,
it might be a boy; the chances were equal.  The Squire would not
listen to any one else at all; so as the time went on his idea was
more firmly fixed than ever.  His arrangements were made on the base
that he would have a son.  The name was of course decided.  Stephen
had been the name of all the Squires of Normanstand for ages--as far
back as the records went; and Stephen the new heir of course would
be.

Like all middle-aged men with young wives he was supremely anxious as
the time drew near.  In his anxiety for his wife his belief in the
son became passive rather than active.  Indeed, the idea of a son was
so deeply fixed in his mind that it was not disturbed even by his
anxiety for the young wife he idolised.

When instead of a son a daughter was born, the Doctor and the nurse,
who knew his views on the subject, held back from the mother for a
little the knowledge of the sex.  Dame Norman was so weak that the
Doctor feared lest anxiety as to how her husband would bear the
disappointment, might militate against her.  Therefore the Doctor
sought the Squire in his study, and went resolutely at his task.

'Well, Squire, I congratulate you on the birth of your child!'
Norman was of course struck with the use of the word 'child'; but the
cause of his anxiety was manifested by his first question:

'How is she, Doctor?  Is she safe?'  The child was after all of
secondary importance!  The Doctor breathed more freely; the question
had lightened his task.  There was, therefore, more assurance in his
voice as he answered:

'She is safely through the worst of her trouble, but I am greatly
anxious yet.  She is very weak.  I fear anything that might upset
her.'

The Squire's voice came quick and strong:

'There must be no upset!  And now tell me about my son?'  He spoke
the last word half with pride, half bashfully.

'Your son is a daughter!'  There was silence for so long that the
Doctor began to be anxious.  Squire Norman sat quite still; his right
hand resting on the writing-table before him became clenched so hard
that the knuckles looked white and the veins red.  After a long slow
breath he spoke:

'She, my daughter, is well?'  The Doctor answered with cheerful
alacrity:

'Splendid!--I never saw a finer child in my life.  She will be a
comfort and an honour to you!'  The Squire spoke again:

'What does her mother think?  I suppose she's very proud of her?'

'She does not know yet that it is a girl.  I thought it better not to
let her know till I had told you.'

'Why?'

'Because--because--Norman, old friend, you know why!  Because you had
set your heart on a son; and I know how it would grieve that sweet
young wife and mother to feel your disappointment.  I want your lips
to be the first to tell her; so that on may assure her of your
happiness in that a daughter has been born to you.'

The Squire put out his great hand and laid it on the other's
shoulder.  There was almost a break in his voice as he said:

'Thank you, my old friend, my true friend, for your thought.  When
may I see her?'

'By right, not yet.  But, as knowing your views, she may fret herself
till she knows, I think you had better come at once.'

All Norman's love and strength combined for his task.  As he leant
over and kissed his young wife there was real fervour in his voice as
he said:

'Where is my dear daughter that you may place her in my arms?'  For
an instant there came a chill to the mother's heart that her hopes
had been so far disappointed; but then came the reaction of her joy
that her husband, her baby's father, was pleased.  There was a
heavenly dawn of red on her pale face as she drew her husband's head
down and kissed him.

'Oh, my dear,' she said, 'I am so happy that you are pleased!'  The
nurse took the mother's hand gently and held it to the baby as she
laid it in the father's arms.

He held the mother's hand as he kissed the baby's brow.

The Doctor touched him gently on the arm and beckoned him away.  He
went with careful footsteps, looking behind as he went.

After dinner he talked with the Doctor on various matters; but
presently he asked:

'I suppose, Doctor, it is no sort of rule that the first child
regulates the sex of a family?'

'No, of course not.  Otherwise how should we see boys and girls mixed
in one family, as is nearly always the case.  But, my friend,' he
went on, 'you must not build hopes so far away.  I have to tell you
that your wife is far from strong.  Even now she is not so well as I
could wish, and there yet may be change.'  The Squire leaped
impetuously to his feet as he spoke quickly:

'Then why are we waiting here?  Can nothing be done?  Let us have the
best help, the best advice in the world.'  The Doctor raised his
hand.

'Nothing can be done as yet.  I have only fear.'

'Then let us be ready in case your fears should be justified!  Who
are the best men in London to help in such a case?'  The Doctor
mentioned two names; and within a few minutes a mounted messenger was
galloping to Norcester, the nearest telegraph centre.  The messenger
was to arrange for a special train if necessary.  Shortly afterwards
the Doctor went again to see his patient.  After a long absence he
came back, pale and agitated.  Norman felt his heart sink when he saw
him; a groan broke from him as the Doctor spoke:

'She is much worse!  I am in great fear that she may pass away before
the morning!'  The Squire's strong voice was clouded, with a hoarse
veil as he asked:

'May I see her?'

'Not yet; at present she is sleeping.  She may wake strengthened; in
which case you may see her.  But if not--'

'If not?'--the voice was not like his own.

'Then I shall send for you at once!'  The Doctor returned to his
vigil.  The Squire, left alone, sank on his knees, his face in his
hands; his great shoulders shook with the intensity of his grief.

An hour or more passed before he heard hurried steps.  He sprang to
the door:

'Well?'

'You had better come now.'

'Is she better?'

'Alas! no.  I fear her minutes are numbered.  School yourself, my
dear old friend!  God will help you in this bitter hour.  All you can
do now is to make her last moments happy.'

'I know!  I know!' he answered in a voice so calm that his companion
wondered.

When they came into the room Margaret was dozing.  When her eyes
opened and she found her husband beside her bed there spread over her
face a glad look; which, alas! soon changed to one of pain.  She
motioned to him to bend down.  He knelt and put his head beside her
on the pillow; his arms went tenderly round her as though by his iron
devotion and strength he would shield her from all harm.  Her voice
came very low and in broken gasps; she was summoning all her strength
that she might speak:

'My dear, dear husband, I am so sad at leaving you!  You have made me
so happy, and I love you so!  Forgive me, dear, for the pain I know
you will suffer when I am gone!  And oh, Stephen, I know you will
cherish our little one--yours and mine--when I am gone.  She will
have no mother; you will have to be father and mother too.'

'I will hold her in my very heart's core, my darling, as I hold you!'
He could hardly speak from emotion.  She went on:

'And oh, my dear, you will not grieve that she is not a son to carry
on your name?'  And then a sudden light came into her eyes; and there
was exultation in her weak voice as she said:

'She is to be our only one; let her be indeed our son!  Call her the
name we both love!'  For answer he rose and laid his hand very, very
tenderly on the babe as he said:

'This dear one, my sweet wife, who will carry your soul in her
breast, will be my son; the only son I shall ever have.  All my life
long I shall, please Almighty God, so love her--our little Stephen--
as you and I love each other!'

She laid her hand on his so that it touched at once her husband and
her child.  Then she raised the other weak arm, and placed it round
his neck, and their lips met.  Her soul went out in this last kiss.



CHAPTER II--THE HEART OF A CHILD



For some weeks after his wife's death Squire Norman was overwhelmed
with grief.  He made a brave effort, however, to go through the
routine of his life; and succeeded so far that he preserved an
external appearance of bearing his loss with resignation.  But
within, all was desolation.

Little Stephen had winning ways which sent deep roots into her
father's heart.  The little bundle of nerves which the father took
into his arms must have realised with all its senses that, in all
that it saw and heard and touched, there was nothing but love and
help and protection.  Gradually the trust was followed by
expectation.  If by some chance the father was late in coming to the
nursery the child would grow impatient and cast persistent, longing
glances at the door.  When he came all was joy.

Time went quickly by, and Norman was only recalled to its passing by
the growth of his child.  Seedtime and harvest, the many comings of
nature's growth were such commonplaces to him, and had been for so
many years, that they made on him no impressions of comparison.  But
his baby was one and one only.  Any change in it was not only in
itself a new experience, but brought into juxtaposition what is with
what was.  The changes that began to mark the divergence of sex were
positive shocks to him, for they were unexpected.  In the very dawn
of babyhood dress had no special import; to his masculine eyes sex
was lost in youth.  But, little by little, came the tiny changes
which convention has established.  And with each change came to
Squire Norman the growing realisation that his child was a woman.  A
tiny woman, it is true, and requiring more care and protection and
devotion than a bigger one; but still a woman.  The pretty little
ways, the eager caresses, the graspings and holdings of the childish
hands, the little roguish smiles and pantings and flirtings were all
but repetitions in little of the dalliance of long ago.  The father,
after all, reads in the same book in which the lover found his
knowledge.

At first there was through all his love for his child a certain
resentment of her sex.  His old hope of a son had been rooted too
deeply to give way easily.  But when the conviction came, and with it
the habit of its acknowledgment, there came also a certain
resignation, which is the halting-place for satisfaction.  But he
never, not then nor afterwards, quite lost the old belief that
Stephen was indeed a son.  Could there ever have been a doubt, the
remembrance of his wife's eyes and of her faint voice, of her hope
and her faith, as she placed her baby in his arms would have refused
it a resting-place.  This belief tinged all his after-life and
moulded his policy with regard to his girl's upbringing.  If she was
to be indeed his son as well as his daughter, she must from the first
be accustomed to boyish as well as to girlish ways.  This, in that
she was an only child, was not a difficult matter to accomplish.  Had
she had brothers and sisters, matters of her sex would soon have
found their own level.

There was one person who objected strongly to any deviation from the
conventional rule of a girl's education.  This was Miss Laetitia
Rowly, who took after a time, in so far as such a place could be
taken, that of the child's mother.  Laetitia Rowly was a young aunt
of Squire Rowly of Norwood; the younger sister of his father and some
sixteen years his own senior.  When the old Squire's second wife had
died, Laetitia, then a conceded spinster of thirty-six, had taken
possession of the young Margaret.  When Margaret had married Squire
Norman, Miss Rowly was well satisfied; for she had known Stephen
Norman all her life.  Though she could have wished a younger
bridegroom for her darling, she knew it would be hard to get a better
man or one of more suitable station in life.  Also she knew that
Margaret loved him, and the woman who had never found the happiness
of mutual love in her own life found a pleasure in the romance of
true love, even when the wooer was middle-aged.  She had been
travelling in the Far East when the belated news of Margaret's death
came to her.  When she had arrived home she announced her intention
of taking care of Margaret's child, just as she had taken care of
Margaret.  For several reasons this could not be done in the same
way.  She was not old enough to go and live at Normanstand without
exciting comment; and the Squire absolutely refused to allow that his
daughter should live anywhere except in his own house.  Educational
supervision, exercised at such distance and so intermittently, could
neither be complete nor exact.

Though Stephen was a sweet child she was a wilful one, and very early
in life manifested a dominant nature.  This was a secret pleasure to
her father, who, never losing sight of his old idea that she was both
son and daughter, took pleasure as well as pride out of each
manifestation of her imperial will.  The keen instinct of childhood,
which reasons in feminine fashion, and is therefore doubly effective
in a woman-child, early grasped the possibilities of her own will.
She learned the measure of her nurse's foot and then of her father's;
and so, knowing where lay the bounds of possibility of the
achievement of her wishes, she at once avoided trouble and learned
how to make the most of the space within the limit of her tether.

It is not those who 'cry for the Moon' who go furthest or get most in
this limited world of ours.  Stephen's pretty ways and unfailing good
temper were a perpetual joy to her father; and when he found that as
a rule her desires were reasonable, his wish to yield to them became
a habit.

Miss Rowly seldom saw any individual thing to disapprove of.  She it
was who selected the governesses and who interviewed them from time
to time as to the child's progress.  Not often was there any
complaint, for the little thing had such a pretty way of showing
affection, and such a manifest sense of justified trust in all whom
she encountered, that it would have been hard to name a specific
fault.

But though all went in tears of affectionate regret, and with
eminently satisfactory emoluments and references, there came an
irregularly timed succession of governesses.

Stephen's affection for her 'Auntie' was never affected by any of the
changes.  Others might come and go, but there no change came.  The
child's little hand would steal into one of the old lady's strong
ones, or would clasp a finger and hold it tight.  And then the woman
who had never had a child of her own would feel, afresh each time, as
though the child's hand was gripping her heart.

With her father she was sweetest of all.  And as he seemed to be
pleased when she did anything like a little boy, the habit of being
like one insensibly grew on her.

An only child has certain educational difficulties.  The true
learning is not that which we are taught, but that which we take in
for ourselves from experience and observation, and children's
experiences and observation, especially of things other than
repressive, are mainly of children.  The little ones teach each
other.  Brothers and sisters are more with each other than are
ordinary playmates, and in the familiarity of their constant
intercourse some of the great lessons, so useful in after-life, are
learned.  Little Stephen had no means of learning the wisdom of give-
and-take.  To her everything was given, given bountifully and
gracefully.  Graceful acceptance of good things came to her
naturally, as it does to one who is born to be a great lady.  The
children of the farmers in the neighbourhood, with whom at times she
played, were in such habitual awe of the great house, that they were
seldom sufficiently at ease to play naturally.  Children cannot be on
equal terms on special occasions with a person to whom they have been
taught to bow or courtesy as a public habit.  The children of
neighbouring landowners, who were few and far between, and of the
professional people in Norcester, were at such times as Stephen met
them, generally so much on their good behaviour, that the spontaneity
of play, through which it is that sharp corners of individuality are
knocked off or worn down, did not exist.

And so Stephen learned to read in the Book of Life; though only on
one side of it.  At the age of six she had, though surrounded with
loving care and instructed by skilled teachers, learned only the
accepting side of life.  Giving of course there was in plenty, for
the traditions of Normanstand were royally benevolent; many a
blessing followed the little maid's footsteps as she accompanied some
timely aid to the sick and needy sent from the Squire's house.
Moreover, her Aunt tried to inculcate certain maxims founded on that
noble one that it is more blessed to give than to receive.  But of
giving in its true sense:  the giving that which we want for
ourselves, the giving that is as a temple built on the rock of self-
sacrifice, she knew nothing.  Her sweet and spontaneous nature, which
gave its love and sympathy so readily, was almost a bar to education:
it blinded the eyes that would have otherwise seen any defect that
wanted altering, any evil trait that needed repression, any lagging
virtue that required encouragement--or the spur.



CHAPTER III--HAROLD



Squire Norman had a clerical friend whose rectory of Carstone lay
some thirty miles from Normanstand.  Thirty miles is not a great
distance for railway travel; but it is a long drive.  The days had
not come, nor were they ever likely to come, for the making of a
railway between the two places.  For a good many years the two men
had met in renewal of their old University days.  Squire Norman and
Dr. An Wolf had been chums at Trinity, Cambridge, and the boyish
friendship had ripened and lasted.  When Harold An Wolf had put in
his novitiate in a teeming Midland manufacturing town, it was
Norman's influence which obtained the rectorship for his friend.  It
was not often that they could meet, for An Wolf's work, which, though
not very exacting, had to be done single-handed, kept him to his
post.  Besides, he was a good scholar and eked out a small income by
preparing a few pupils for public school.  An occasional mid-week
visit to Normanstand in the slack time of school work on the Doctor's
part, and now and again a drive by Norman over to the rectory,
returning the next day, had been for a good many years the measure of
their meeting.  Then An Wolf's marriage and the birth of a son had
kept him closer to home.  Mrs. An Wolf had been killed in a railway
accident a couple of years after her only child had been born; and at
the time Norman had gone over to render any assistance in his power
to the afflicted man, and to give him what was under the
circumstances his best gift, sympathy.  After an interval of a few
years the Squire's courtship and marriage, at which his old friend
had assisted, had confined his activities to a narrower circle.  The
last time they had met was when An Wolf had come over to Norcester to
aid in the burial of his friend's wife.  In the process of years,
however, the shadow over Norman's life had begun to soften; when his
baby had grown to be something of a companion, they met again.
Norman, 'who had never since his wife's death been able to tear
himself, even for a night, away from Normanstand and Stephen, wrote
to his old friend asking him to come to him.  An Wolf gladly
promised, and for a week of growing expectation the Squire looked
forward to their meeting.  Each found the other somewhat changed, in
all but their old affection.

An Wolf was delighted with the little Stephen.  Her dainty beauty
seemed to charm him; and the child, seeming to realise what pleasure
she was giving, exercised all her little winning ways.  The rector,
who knew more of children than did his, friend, told her as she sat
on his knee of a very interesting person:  his own son.  The child
listened, interested at first, then enraptured.  She asked all kinds
of questions; and the father's eyes brightened as he gladly answered
the pretty sympathetic child, already deep in his heart for her
father's sake.  He told her about the boy who was so big and strong,
and who could run and leap and swim and play cricket and football
better than any other boy with whom he played.  When, warmed himself
by the keen interest of the little girl, and seeing her beautiful
black eyes beginning to glow, he too woke to the glory of the time;
and all the treasured moments of the father's lonely heart gave out
their store.  And the other father, thrilled with delight because of
his baby's joy with, underlying all, an added pleasure that the
little Stephen's interest was in sports that were for boys, looked on
approvingly, now and again asking questions himself in furtherance of
the child's wishes.

All the afternoon they sat in the garden, close to the stream that
came out of the rock, and An Wolf told father's tales of his only
son.  Of the great cricket match with Castra Puerorum when he had
made a hundred not out.  Of the school races when he had won so many
prizes.  Of the swimming match in the Islam River when, after he had
won the race and had dressed himself, he went into the water in his
clothes to help some children who had upset a boat.  How when Widow
Norton's only son could not be found, he dived into the deep hole of
the intake of the milldam of the great Carstone mills where Wingate
the farrier had been drowned.  And how, after diving twice without
success, he had insisted on going down the third time though people
had tried to hold him back; and how he had brought up in his arms the
child all white and so near death that they had to put him in the
ashes of the baker's oven before he could be brought back to life.

When her nurse came to take her to bed, she slid down from her
father's knee and coming over to Dr. An Wolf, gravely held out her
hand and said:  'Good-bye!'  Then she kissed him and said:

'Thank you so much, Mr. Harold's daddy.  Won't you come soon again,
and tell us more?'  Then she jumped again upon her father's knee and
hugged him round the neck and kissed him, and whispered in his ear:

'Daddy, please make Mr. Harold's daddy when he comes again, bring
Harold with him!'

After all it is natural for women to put the essence of the letter in
the postscript!

Two weeks afterwards Dr. An Wolf came again and brought Harold with
him.  The time had gone heavily with little Stephen when she knew
that Harold was coming with his father.  Stephen had been all afire
to see the big boy whose feats had so much interested her, and for a
whole week had flooded Mrs. Jarrold with questions which she was
unable to answer.  At last the time came and she went out to the hall
door with her father to welcome the guests.  At the top of the great
granite steps, down which in time of bad weather the white awning
ran, she stood holding her father's hand and waving a welcome.

'Good morning, Harold!  Good morning, Mr. Harold's daddy!'

The meeting was a great pleasure to both the children, and resulted
in an immediate friendship.  The small girl at once conceived a great
admiration for the big, strong boy nearly twice her age and more than
twice her size.  At her time of life the convenances are not, and
love is a thing to be spoken out at once and in the open.  Mrs.
Jarrold, from the moment she set eyes on him, liked the big kindly-
faced boy who treated her like a lady, and who stood awkwardly
blushing and silent in the middle of the nursery listening to the
tiny child's proffers of affection.  For whatever kind of love it is
that boys are capable of, Harold had fallen into it.  'Calf-love' is
a thing habitually treated with contempt.  It may be ridiculous; but
all the same it is a serious reality--to the calf.

Harold's new-found affection was as deep as his nature.  An only
child who had in his memory nothing of a mother's love, his naturally
affectionate nature had in his childish days found no means of
expression.  A man child can hardly pour out his full heart to a man,
even a father or a comrade; and this child had not, in a way, the
consolations of other children.  His father's secondary occupation of
teaching brought other boys to the house and necessitated a domestic
routine which had to be exact.  There was no place for little girls
in a boys' school; and though many of Dr. An Wolf's friends who were
mothers made much of the pretty, quiet boy, and took him to play with
their children, he never seemed to get really intimate with them.
The equality of companionship was wanting.  Boys he knew, and with
them he could hold his own and yet be on affectionate terms.  But
girls were strange to him, and in their presence he was shy.  With
this lack of understanding of the other sex, grew up a sort of awe of
it.  His opportunities of this kind of study were so few that the
view never could become rectified.

And so it was that from his boyhood up to his twelfth year, Harold's
knowledge of girlhood never increased nor did his awe diminish.  When
his father had told him all about his visit to Normanstand and of the
invitation which had been extended to him there came first awe, then
doubt, then expectation.  Between Harold and his father there was
love and trust and sympathy.   The father's married love so soon cut
short found expression towards his child; and between them there had
never been even the shadow of a cloud.  When his father told him how
pretty the little Stephen was, how dainty, how sweet, he began to
picture her in his mind's eye and to be bashfully excited over
meeting her.

His first glimpse of Stephen was, he felt, one that he never could
forget.  She had made up her mind that she would let Harold see what
she could do.  Harold could fly kites and swim and play cricket; she
could not do any of these, but she could ride.  Harold should see her
pony, and see her riding him all by herself.  And there would be
another pony for Harold, a big, big, big one--she had spoken about
its size herself to Topham, the stud-groom.  She had coaxed her daddy
into promising that after lunch she should take Harold riding.  To
this end she had made ready early.  She had insisted on putting on
the red riding habit which Daddy had given her for her birthday, and
now she stood on the top of the steps all glorious in hunting pink,
with the habit held over her arms, with the tiny hunting-hoots all
shiny underneath.  She had no hat on, and her beautiful hair of
golden red shone in its glory.  But even it was almost outshone by
the joyous flush on her cheeks as she stood waving the little hand
that did not hold Daddy's.  She was certainly a picture to dream of!
Her father's eyes lost nothing of her dainty beauty.  He was so proud
of her that he almost forgot to wish that she had been a boy.  The
pleasure he felt in her appearance was increased by the fact that her
dress was his own idea.

During luncheon Stephen was fairly silent; she usually chattered all
through as freely as a bird sings.  Stephen was silent because the
occasion was important.  Besides, Daddy wasn't all alone, and
therefore had not to be cheered up.  Also--this in postscript form--
Harold was silent!  In her present frame of mind Harold could do no
wrong, and what Harold did was right.  She was unconsciously learning
already a lesson from his presence.

That evening when going to bed she came to say good-night to Daddy.
After she had kissed him she also kissed 'old Mr. Harold,' as she now
called him, and as a matter of course kissed Harold also.  He
coloured up at once.  It was the first time a girl had ever kissed
him.

The next day from early morning until bed-time was one long joy to
Stephen, and there were few things of interest that Harold had not
been shown; there were few of the little secrets which had not been
shared with him as they went about hand in hand.  Like all manly boys
Harold was good to little children and patient with them.  He was
content to follow Stephen about and obey all her behests.  He had
fallen in love with her to the very bottom of his boyish heart.

When the guests were going, Stephen stood with her father on the
steps to see them off.  When the carriage had swept behind the
farthest point in the long avenue, and when Harold's cap waving from
the window could no longer be seen, Squire Norman turned to go in,
but paused in obedience to the unconscious restraint of Stephen's
hand.  He waited patiently till with a long sigh she turned to him
and they went in together.

That night before she went to bed Stephen came and sat on her
father's knee, and after sundry pattings and kissings whispered in
his ear:

'Daddy, wouldn't it be nice if Harold could come here altogether?
Couldn't you ask him to?  And old Mr. Harold could come too.  Oh, I
wish he was here!'



CHAPTER IV--HAROLD AT NORMANSTAND



Two years afterwards a great blow fell upon Harold.  His father, who
had been suffering from repeated attacks of influenza, was, when in
the low condition following this, seized with pneumonia, to which in
a few days he succumbed.  Harold was heart-broken.  The affection
which had been between him and his father had been so consistent that
he had never known a time when it was not.

When Squire Norman had returned to the house with him after the
funeral, he sat in silence holding the boy's hand till he had wept
his heart out.  By this time the two were old friends, and the boy
was not afraid or too shy to break down before him.  There was
sufficient of the love of the old generation to begin with trust in
the new.

Presently, when the storm was past and Harold had become his own man
again, Norman said:

'And now, Harold, I want you to listen to me.  You know, my dear boy,
that I am your father's oldest friend, and right sure I am that he
would approve of what I say.  You must come home with me to live.  I
know that in his last hours the great concern of your dear father's
heart would have been for the future of his boy.  And I know, too,
that it was a comfort to him to feel that you and I are such friends,
and that the son of my dearest old friend would be as a son to me.
We have been friends, you and I, a long time, Harold; and we have
learned to trust, and I hope to love, one another.  And you and my
little Stephen are such friends already that your coming into the
house will be a joy to us all.  Why, long ago, when first you came,
she said to me the night you went away:  ""Daddy, wouldn't it be nice
if Harold could come here altogether?""'

And so Harold An Wolf came back with the Squire to Normanstand, and
from that day on became a member of his house, and as a son to him.
Stephen's delight at his coming was of course largely qualified by
her sympathy with his grief; but it would have been hard to give him
more comfort than she did in her own pretty way.  Putting her lips to
his she kissed him, and holding his big hand in both of her little
ones, she whispered softly:

'Poor Harold!  You and I should love each other, for we have both
lost our mother.  And now you have lost your father.  But you must
let my dear daddy be yours too!'

At this time Harold was between fourteen and fifteen years old.  He
was well educated in so far as private teaching went.  His father had
devoted much care to him, so that he was well grounded in all the
Academic branches of learning.  He was also, for his years, an expert
in most manly exercises.  He could ride anything, shoot straight,
fence, run, jump or swim with any boy more than his age and size.

In Normanstand his education was continued by the rector.  The Squire
used often to take him with him when he went to ride, or fish, or
shoot; frankly telling him that as his daughter was, as yet, too
young to be his companion in these matters, he would act as her locum
tenens.  His living in the house and his helping as he did in
Stephen's studies made familiarity perpetual.  He was just enough her
senior to command her childish obedience; and there were certain
qualities in his nature which were eminently calculated to win and
keep the respect of women as well as of men.  He was the very
incarnation of sincerity, and had now and again, in certain ways, a
sublime self-negation which, at times, seemed in startling contrast
to a manifestly militant nature.  When at school he had often been
involved in fights which were nearly always on matters of principle,
and by a sort of unconscious chivalry he was generally found fighting
on the weaker side.  Harold's father had been very proud of his
ancestry, which was Gothic through the Dutch, as the manifestly
corrupted prefix of the original name implied, and he had gathered
from a constant study of the Sagas something of the philosophy which
lay behind the ideas of the Vikings.

This new stage of Harold's life made for quicker development than any
which had gone before.  Hitherto he had not the same sense of
responsibility.  To obey is in itself a relief; and as it is an
actual consolation to weak natures, so it is only a retarding of the
strong.  Now he had another individuality to think of.  There was in
his own nature a vein of anxiety of which the subconsciousness of his
own strength threw up the outcrop.

Little Stephen with the instinct of her sex discovered before long
this weakness.  For it is a weakness when any quality can be assailed
or used.  The using of a man's weakness is not always coquetry; but
it is something very like it.  Many a time the little girl, who
looked up to and admired the big boy who could compel her to anything
when he was so minded, would, for her own ends, work on his sense of
responsibility, taking an elfin delight in his discomfiture.

The result of Stephen's harmless little coquetries was that Harold
had occasionally either to thwart some little plan of daring, or else
cover up its results.  In either case her confidence in him grew, so
that before long he became an established fact in her life, a being
in whose power and discretion and loyalty she had absolute, blind
faith.  And this feeling seemed to grow with her own growth.  Indeed
at one time it came to be more than an ordinary faith.  It happened
thus:

The old Church of St. Stephen, which was the parish church of
Normanstand, had a peculiar interest for the Norman family.  There,
either within the existing walls or those which had preceded them
when the church was rebuilt by that Sir Stephen who was standard-
bearer to Henry VI., were buried all the direct members of the line.
It was an unbroken record of the inheritors since the first Sir
Stephen, who had his place in the Domesday Book.  Without, in the
churchyard close to the church, were buried all such of the
collaterals as had died within hail of Norcester.  Some there were of
course who, having achieved distinction in various walks of life,
were further honoured by a resting-place within the chancel.  The
whole interior was full of records of the family.  Squire Norman was
fond of coming to the place; and often from the very beginning had
taken Stephen with him.  One of her earliest recollections was
kneeling down with her father, who held her hand in his, whilst with
the other he wiped the tears from his eyes, before a tomb sculptured
beautifully in snowy marble.  She never forgot the words he had said
to her:

'You will always remember, darling, that your dear mother rests in
this sacred place.  When I am gone, if you are ever in any trouble
come here.  Come alone and open out your heart.  You need never fear
to ask God for help at the grave of your mother!'  The child had been
impressed, as had been many and many another of her race.  For seven
hundred years each child of the house of Norman had been brought
alone by either parent and had heard some such words.  The custom had
come to be almost a family ritual, and it never failed to leave its
impress in greater or lesser degree.

Whenever Harold had in the early days paid a visit to Normanstand,
the church had generally been an objective of their excursions.  He
was always delighted to go.  His love for his own ancestry made him
admire and respect that of others; so that Stephen's enthusiasm in
the matter was but another cord to bind him to her.

In one of their excursions they found the door into the crypt open;
and nothing would do Stephen but that they should enter it.  To-day,
however, they had no light; but they arranged that on the morrow they
would bring candles with them and explore the place thoroughly.  The
afternoon of the next day saw them at the door of the crypt with a
candle, which Harold proceeded to light.  Stephen looked on
admiringly, and said in a half-conscious way, the half-consciousness
being shown in the implication:

'You are not afraid of the crypt?'

'Not a bit!  In my father's church there was a crypt, and I was in it
several times.'  As he spoke the memory of the last time he had been
there swept over him.  He seemed to see again the many lights, held
in hands that were never still, making a grim gloom where the black
shadows were not; to hear again the stamp and hurried shuffle of the
many feet, as the great oak coffin was borne by the struggling mass
of men down the steep stairway and in through the narrow door . . .
And then the hush when voices faded away; and the silence seemed a
real thing, as for a while he stood alone close to the dead father
who had been all in all to him.  And once again he seemed to feel the
recall to the living world of sorrow and of light, when his inert
hand was taken in the strong loving one of Squire Norman.

He paused and drew back.

'Why don't you go on?' she asked, surprised.

He did not like to tell her then.  Somehow, it seemed out of place.
He had often spoken to her of his father, and she had always been a
sympathetic listener; but here, at the entrance of the grim vault, he
did not wish to pain her with his own thoughts of sorrow and all the
terrible memories which the similarity of the place evoked.  And even
whilst he hesitated there came to him a thought so laden with pain
and fear that he rejoiced at the pause which gave it to him in time.
It was in that very crypt that Stephen's mother had been buried, and
had they two gone in, as they had intended, the girl might have seen
her mother's coffin as he had seen his father's, but under
circumstances which made him shiver.  He had been, as he said, often
in the crypt at Carstone; and well he knew the sordidness of the
chamber of death.  His imagination was alive as well as his memory;
he shuddered, not for himself, but for Stephen.  How could he allow
the girl to suffer in such a way as she might, as she infallibly
would, if it were made apparent to her in such a brutal way?  How
pitiful, how meanly pitiful, is the aftermath of death.  Well he
remembered how many a night he woke in an agony, thinking of how his
father lay in that cold, silent, dust-strewn vault, in the silence
and the dark, with never a ray of light or hope or love!  Gone,
abandoned, forgotten by all, save perhaps one heart which bled . . .
He would save little Stephen, if he could, from such a memory.  He
would not give any reason for refusing to go in.

He blew out the candle, and turned the key in the lock, took it out,
and put it in his pocket.

'Come, Stephen!' he said, 'let us go somewhere else.  We will not go
into the crypt to-day!'

'Why not?'  The lips that spoke were pouted mutinously and the face
was flushed.  The imperious little lady was not at all satisfied to
give up the cherished project.  For a whole day and night she had,
whilst waking, thought of the coming adventure; the thrill of it was
not now to be turned to cold disappointment without even an
explanation.  She did not think that Harold was afraid; that would be
ridiculous.  But she wondered; and mysteries always annoyed her.  She
did not like to be at fault, more especially when other people knew.
All the pride in her revolted.

'Why not?' she repeated more imperiously still.

Harold said kindly:

'Because, Stephen, there is really a good reason.  Don't ask me, for
I can't tell you.  You must take it from me that I am right.  You
know, dear, that I wouldn't willingly disappoint you; and I know that
you had set your heart on this.  But indeed, indeed I have a good
reason.'

Stephen was really angry now.  She was amenable to reason, though she
did not consciously know what reason was; but to accept some one
else's reason blindfold was repugnant to her nature, even at her then
age.  She was about to speak angrily, but looking up she saw that
Harold's mouth was set with marble firmness.  So, after her manner,
she acquiesced in the inevitable and said:

'All right!  Harold.'

But in the inner recesses of her firm-set mind was a distinct
intention to visit the vault when more favourable circumstances would
permit.



CHAPTER V--THE CRYPT



It was some weeks before Stephen got the chance she wanted.  She knew
it would be difficult to evade Harold's observation, for the big
boy's acuteness as to facts had impressed itself on her.  It was
strange that out of her very trust in Harold came a form of distrust
in others.  In the little matter of evading him she inclined to any
one in whom there was his opposite, in whose reliability she
instinctively mistrusted.  'There is nothing bad or good but thinking
makes it so!'  To enter that crypt, which had seemed so small a
matter at first, had now in process of thinking and wishing and
scheming become a thing to be much desired.  Harold saw, or rather
felt, that something was in the girl's mind, and took for granted
that it had something to do with the crypt.  But he thought it better
not to say anything lest he should keep awake a desire which he hoped
would die naturally.

One day it was arranged that Harold should go over to Carstone to see
the solicitor who had wound up his father's business.  He was to stay
the night and ride back next day.  Stephen, on hearing of the
arrangement, so contrived matters that Master Everard, the son of a
banker who had recently purchased an estate in the neighbourhood, was
asked to come to play with her on the day when Harold left.  It was
holiday time at Eton, and he was at home.  Stephen did not mention to
Harold the fact of his coming; it was only from a chance allusion of
Mrs. Jarrold before he went that he inferred it.  He did not think
the matter of sufficient importance to wonder why Stephen, who
generally told him everything, had not mentioned this.

During their play, Stephen, after pledging him to secrecy, told
Leonard of her intention of visiting the crypt, and asked him to help
her in it.  This was an adventure, and as such commended itself to
the schoolboy heart.  He entered at once into the scheme con amore;
and the two discussed ways and means.  Leonard's only regret was that
he was associated with a little girl in such a project.  It was
something of a blow to his personal vanity, which was a large item in
his moral equipment, that such a project should have been initiated
by the girl and not by himself.  He was to get possession of the key
and in the forenoon of the next day he was to be waiting in the
churchyard, when Stephen would join him as soon as she could evade
her nurse.  She was now more than eleven, and had less need of being
watched than in her earlier years.  It was possible, with strategy,
to get away undiscovered for an hour.


At Carstone Harold got though what he had to do that same afternoon
and arranged to start early in the morning for Normanstand.  After an
early breakfast he set out on his thirty-mile journey at eight
o'clock.  Littlejohn, his horse, was in excellent form,
notwithstanding his long journey of the day before, and with his nose
pointed for home, put his best foot foremost.  Harold felt in great
spirits.  The long ride the day before had braced him physically,
though there were on his journey times of great sadness when the
thought of his father came back to him and the sense of loss was
renewed with each thought of his old home.  But youth is naturally
buoyant.  His visit to the church, the first thing on his arrival at
Carstone, and his kneeling before the stone made sacred to his
father's memory, though it entailed a silent gush of tears, did him
good, and even seemed to place his sorrow farther away.  When he came
again in the morning before leaving Carstone there were no tears.
There was only a holy memory which seemed to sanctify loss; and his
father seemed nearer to him than ever.

As he drew near Normanstand he looked forward eagerly to seeing
Stephen, and the sight of the old church lying far below him as he
came down the steep road over Alt Hill, which was the short-cut from
Norcester, set his mind working.  His visit to the tomb of his own
father made him think of the day when he kept Stephen from entering
the crypt.

The keenest thought is not always conscious.  It was without definite
intention that when he came to the bridle-path Harold turned his
horse's head and rode down to the churchyard.  As he pushed open the
door of the church he half expected to see Stephen; and there was a
vague possibility that Leonard Everard might be with her.

The church was cool and dim.  Coming from the hot glare the August
sunshine it seemed, at the first glance, dark.  He looked around, and
a sense of relief came over him.  The place was empty.

But even as he stood, there came a sound which made his heart grow
cold.  A cry, muffled, far away and full of anguish; a sobbing cry,
which suddenly ceased.

It was the voice of Stephen.  He instinctively knew where it came
from; the crypt.  Only for the experience he had had of her desire to
enter the place, he would never have suspected that it was so close
to him.  He ran towards the corner where commenced the steps leading
downward.  As he reached the spot a figure came rushing up the steps.
A boy in Eton jacket and wide collar, careless, pale, and agitated.
It was Leonard Everard.  Harold seized him as he came.

'Where is Stephen?' he cried in a quick, low voice.

'In the vault below there.  She dropped her light and then took mine,
and she dropped it too.  Let me go!  Let me go!'  He struggled to get
away; but Harold held him tight.

'Where are the matches?'

'In my pocket.  Let me go!  Let me go!'

'Give me them--this instant!'  He was examining the frightened boy's
waistcoat pockets as he spoke.  When he had got the matches he let
the boy go, and ran down the steps and through the open door into the
crypt, calling out as he came:

'Stephen!  Stephen dear, where are you?  It is I--Harold!'  There was
no response; his heart seemed to grow cold and his knees to weaken.
The match spluttered and flashed, and in the momentary glare he saw
across the vault, which was not a large place, a white mass on the
ground.  He had to go carefully, lest the match should be blown out
by the wind of his passage; but on coming close he saw that it was
Stephen lying senseless in front of a great coffin which rested on a
built-out pile of masonry.  Then the match went out.  In the flare of
the next one he lit he saw a piece of candle lying on top of the
coffin.  He seized and lit it.  He was able to think coolly despite
his agitation, and knew that light was the first necessity.  The
bruised wick was slow to catch; he had to light another match, his
last one, before it flamed.  The couple of seconds that the light
went down till the grease melted and the flame leaped again seemed of
considerable length.  When the lit candle was placed steadily on top
of the coffin, and a light, dim, though strong enough to see with,
spread around, he stooped and lifted Stephen in his arms.  She was
quite senseless, and so limp that a great fear came upon him that she
might be dead.  He did not waste time, but carried her across the
vault where the door to the church steps stood out sharp against the
darkness, and bore her up into the church.  Holding her in one arm,
with the other hand he dragged some long cushions from one of the
pews and spread them on the floor; on these he laid her.  His heart
was smitten with love and pity as he looked.  She was so helpless; so
pitifully helpless!  Her arms and legs were doubled up as though
broken, disjointed; the white frock was smeared with patches of thick
dust.  Instinctively he stooped and pulled the frock down and
straightened out the arms and feet.  He knelt beside her, and felt if
her heart was still beating, a great fear over him, a sick
apprehension.  A gush of thankful prayer came from his heart.  Thank
God! she was alive; he could feel her heart beat, though faintly
underneath his hand.  He started to his feet and ran towards the
door, seizing his hat, which lay on a seat.  He wanted it to bring
back some water.  As he passed out of the door he saw Leonard a
little distance off, but took no notice of him.  He ran to the
stream, filled his hat with water, and brought it back.  When he came
into the church he saw Stephen, already partially restored, sitting
up on the cushions with Leonard supporting her.

He was rejoiced; but somehow disappointed.  He would rather Leonard
had not been there.  He remembered--he could not forget--the white
face of the boy who fled out of the crypt leaving Stephen in a faint
within, and who had lingered outside the church door whilst he ran
for water.  Harold came forward quickly and raised Stephen, intending
to bring her into the fresh air.  He had a shrewd idea that the sight
of the sky and God's greenery would be the best medicine for her
after her fright.  He lifted her in his strong arms as he used to do
when she was a very little child and had got tired in their walks
together; and carried her to the door.  She lent herself
unconsciously to the movement, holding fast with her arm round his
neck as she used to do.  In her clinging was the expression of her
trust in him.  The little sigh with which she laid her head on his
shoulder was the tribute to his masculine power, and her belief in
it.  Every instant her senses were coming back to her more and more.
The veil of oblivion was passing from her half-closed eyes, as the
tide of full remembrance swept in upon her.  Her inner nature was
expressed in the sequence of her emotions.  Her first feeling was one
of her own fault.  The sight of Harold and his proximity recalled to
her vividly how he had refused to go into the crypt, and how she had
intentionally deceived him, negatively, as to her intention of doing
that of which he disapproved.  Her second feeling was one of justice;
and was perhaps partially evoked by the sight of Leonard, who
followed close as Harold brought her to the door.  She did not wish
to speak of herself or Harold before him; but she did not hesitate to
speak of him to Harold:

'You must not blame Leonard.  It was all my fault.  I made him come!'
Her generosity appealed to Harold.  He was angry with the boy for
being there at all; but more for his desertion of the girl in her
trouble.

'I'm not blaming him for being with you!' he said simply.  Leonard
spoke at once.  He had been waiting to defend himself, for that was
what first concerned that young gentleman; next to his pleasure, his
safety most appealed to him.

'I went to get help.  You had let the candle drop; and how could I
see in the dark?  You would insist on looking at the plate on the
coffin!'

A low moan broke from Stephen, a long, low, trembling moan which went
to Harold's heart.  Her head drooped over again on his shoulder; and
she clung close to him as the memory of her shock came back to her.
Harold spoke to Leonard over his shoulder in a low, fierce whisper,
which Stephen did not seem to hear:

'There! that will do.  Go away!  You have done enough already.  Go!
Go!' he added more sternly, as the boy seemed disposed to argue.
Leonard ran a few steps, then walked to the lich-gate, where he
waited.

Stephen clung close to Harold in a state of agitation which was
almost hysterical.  She buried her face in his shoulder, sobbing
brokenly:

'Oh, Harold!  It was too awful.  I never thought, never for a moment,
that my poor dear mother was buried in the crypt.  And when I went to
look at the name on the coffin that was nearest to where I was, I
knocked away the dust, and then I saw her name:  ""Margaret Norman,
aetat 22.""  I couldn't bear it.  She was only a girl herself, only
just twice my age--lying there in that terrible dark place with all
the thick dust and the spiders' webs.  Oh, Harold, Harold!  How shall
I ever bear to think of her lying there, and that I shall never see
her dear face?  Never!  Never!'

He tried to soothe her by patting and holding her hands.  For a good
while the resolution of the girl faltered, and she was but as a
little child.  Then her habitual strength of mind asserted itself.
She did not ask Harold how she came to be out in the church instead
of in the crypt when she recovered her senses.  She seemed to take it
for granted that Leonard had carried her out; and when she said how
brave it had been of him, Harold, with his customary generosity,
allowed her to preserve the belief.  When they had made their way to
the gate Leonard came up to them; but before he could speak Stephen
had begun to thank him.  He allowed her to do so, though the sight of
Harold's mouth set in scorn, and his commanding eyes firmly fixed on
him, made him grow hot and cold alternately.  He withdrew without
speaking; and took his way home with a heart full of bitterness and
revengeful feelings.

In the park Stephen tried to dust herself, and then Harold tried to
assist her.  But her white dress was incurably soiled, the fine dust
of the vault seemed to have got ingrained in the muslin.  When she
got to the house she stole upstairs, so that no one might notice her
till she had made herself tidy.

The next day but one she took Harold for a walk in the afternoon.
When they were quite alone and out of earshot she said:

'I have been thinking all night about poor mother.  Of course I know
she cannot be moved from the crypt.  She must remain there.  But
there needn't be all that dust.  I want you to come there with me
some time soon.  I fear I am afraid to go alone.  I want to bring
some flowers and to tidy up the place.  Won't you come with me this
time?  I know now, Harold, why you didn't let me go in before.  But
now it is different.  This is not curiosity.  It is Duty and Love.
Won't you come with me, Harold?'

Harold leaped from the edge of the ha-ha where he had been sitting
and held up his hand.  She took it and leaped down lightly beside
him.

'Come,' he said, 'let us go there now!'  She took his arm when they
got on the path again, and clinging to him in her pretty girlish way
they went together to the piece of garden which she called her own;
there they picked a great bunch of beautiful white flowers.  Then
they walked to the old church.  The door was open and they passed in.
Harold took from his pocket a tiny key.  This surprised her, and
heightened the agitation which she naturally suffered from revisiting
the place.  She said nothing whilst he opened the door to the crypt.
Within, on a bracket, stood some candles in glass shades and boxes of
matches.  Harold lit three candles, and leaving one of them on the
shelf, and placing his cap beside it, took the other two in his
hands.  Stephen, holding her flowers tightly to her breast with her
right hand, took Harold's arm with the left, and with beating heart
entered the crypt.

For several minutes Harold kept her engaged, telling her about the
crypt in his father's church, and how he went down at his last visit
to see the coffin of his dear father, and how he knelt before it.
Stephen was much moved, and held tight to his arm, her heart beating.
But in the time she was getting accustomed to the place.  Her eyes,
useless at first on coming out of the bright sunlight, and not able
to distinguish anything, began to take in the shape of the place and
to see the rows of great coffins that stood out along the far wall.
She also saw with surprise that the newest coffin, on which for
several reasons her eyes rested, was no longer dusty but was
scrupulously clean.  Following with her eyes as well as she could see
into the further corners she saw that there the same reform had been
effected.  Even the walls and ceiling had been swept of the hanging
cobwebs, and the floor was clean with the cleanliness of ablution.
Still holding Harold's arm, she moved over towards her mother's
coffin and knelt before it.  Harold knelt with her; for a little
while she remained still and silent, praying inwardly.  Then she
rose, and taking her great bunch of flowers placed them lovingly on
the lid of the coffin above where she thought her mother's heart
would be.  Then she turned to Harold, her eyes flowing and her cheeks
wet with tears, and laid her head against his breast.  Her arms could
not go round his neck till he had bent his head, for with his great
height he simply towered above her.  Presently she was quiet; the
paroxysm of her grief had passed.  She took Harold's hand in both
hers, and together they went to the door.  With his disengaged hand,
for he would not have disturbed the other for worlds, Harold put out
the lights and locked the door behind them.

In the church she held him away from her, and looked him fairly in
the face.  She said slowly:

'Harold, was it you who had the crypt cleaned?'  He answered in a low
voice:

'I knew you would want to go again!'

She took the great hand which she held between hers, and before he
knew what she was doing and could prevent her, raised it to her lips
and kissed it, saying lovingly:

'Oh, Harold!  No brother in all the wide world could be kinder.  And-
-and--' this with a sob, 'we both thankk yoou; mother and I!'



CHAPTER VI--A VISIT TO OXFORD



The next important move in the household was Harold's going to
Cambridge.  His father had always intended this, and Squire Norman
had borne his wishes in mind.  Harold joined Trinity, the college
which had been his father's, and took up his residence in due course.

Stephen was now nearly twelve.  Her range of friendships, naturally
limited by her circumstances in life, was enlarged to the full; and
if she had not many close friends there were at least of them all
that was numerically possible.  She still kept up to certain degree
the little gatherings which in her childhood were got together for
her amusement, and in the various games then instituted she still
took a part.  She never lost sight of the fact that her father took a
certain pleasure in her bodily vigour.  And though with her growing
years and the conscious acceptance of her womanhood, she lost sight
of the old childish fancy of being a boy instead of a girl, she could
not lose sight of the fact that strength and alertness are sources of
feminine as well as of masculine power.

Amongst the young friends who came from time to time during his
holidays was Leonard Everard, now a tall, handsome boy.  He was one
of those boys who develop young, and who seem never to have any of
that gawky stage so noticeable in the youth of men made in a large
pattern.  He was always well-poised, trim-set, alert; fleet of foot,
and springy all over.  In games he was facile princeps, seeming to
make his effort always in the right way and without exertion, as if
by an instinct of physical masterdom.  His universal success in such
matters helped to give him an easy debonair manner which was in
itself winning.  So physically complete a youth has always a charm.
In its very presence there is a sort of sympathetic expression, such
as comes with the sunshine.

Stephen always in Leonard's presence showed something of the common
attitude.  His youth and beauty and sex all had their influence on
her.  The influence of sex, as it is understood with regard to a
later period of life, did not in her case exist; Cupid's darts are
barbed and winged for more adult victims.  But in her case Leonard's
masculine superiority, emphasised by the few years between their age,
his sublime self-belief, and, above all, his absolute disregard for
herself or her wishes or her feelings, put him on a level at which
she had to look up to him.  The first step in the ladder of pre-
eminence had been achieved when she realised that he was not on her
level; the second when she experienced rather than thought that he
had more influence on her than she had on him.  Here again was a
little morsel of hero worship, which, though based on a misconception
of fact, was still of influence.  In that episode of the crypt she
had always believed that it was Leonard who had carried her out and
laid her on the church floor in light and safety.  He had been strong
enough and resolute enough to do this, whilst she had fainted!
Harold's generous forbearance had really worked to a false end.

It was not strange, therefore, that she found occasional
companionship with the handsome, wilful, domineering boy somewhat of
luxury.  She did not see him often enough to get tired of him; to
find out the weakness of his character; to realise his deep-seated,
remorseless selfishness.  But after all he was only an episode in a
young life which was full of interests.  Term after term came and
went; the holidays had their seasonable pleasures, occasionally
shared in common.  That was all.

Harold's attitude was the same as ever.  He was of a constant nature;
and now that manhood was within hail the love of his boyhood was
ripening to a man's love.  That was all.  He was with regard to
Stephen the same devoted, worshipping protector, without thought of
self; without hope of reward.  Whatever Stephen wished Harold did;
and Stephen, knowing their old wishes and their old pleasures, was
content with their renewal.  Each holiday between the terms became
mainly a repetition of the days of the old life.  They lived in the
past.

Amongst the things that did not change was Stephen's riding dress.
The scarlet habit had never been a thing for everyday wear, but had
from the first been kept for special occasions.  Stephen herself knew
that it was not a conventional costume; but she rather preferred it,
if on that account alone.  In a certain way she felt justified in
using it; for a red habit was a sort of tradition in the family.

It was on one of these occasions that she had gone with Harold into
the churchyard where they had heard the discussion regarding God and
the Angels.


When Stephen was about sixteen she went for a short visit to Oxford.
She stayed at Somerville with Mrs. Egerton, an old friend of her
mother's, who was a professor at the college.  She sent back her maid
who had travelled with her, as she knew that the college girls did
not have servants of their own.  The visit was prolonged by mutual
consent into a duration of some weeks.  Stephen fell in love with the
place and the life, and had serious thoughts of joining the college
herself.  Indeed she had made up her mind to ask her father to allow
her, knowing well that he would consent to that or to any other
wholesome wish of hers.  But then came the thought that he would be
all alone at home; and following that came another thought, and one
of more poignant feeling.  He was alone now!  Already, for many days,
she had left him, for the first time in her life!  Stephen was quick
to act; well she knew that at home there would be no fault found with
her for a speedy return.  Within a few hours she had brought her
visit to an end, and was by herself, despite Mrs. Egerton's protest,
in the train on the way back to Norcester.

In the train she began to review, for the first time, her visit to
the university.  All had been so strange and new and delightful to
her that she had never stopped for retrospect.  Life in the new and
enchanting place had been in the moving present.  The mind had been
receptive only, gathering data for later thought.  During her visit
she had had no one to direct her thought, and so it had been all
personal, with the freedom of individuality at large.  Of course her
mother's friend, skilled in the mind-workings of average girls, and
able to pick her way through intellectual and moral quagmires, had
taken good care to point out to her certain intellectual movements
and certain moral lessons; just as she had in their various walks and
drives pointed out matters of interest--architectural beauties and
spots of historic import.  And she had taken in, loyally accepted,
and thoroughly assimilated all that she had been told.  But there
were other lessons which were for her young eyes; facts which the
older eyes had ceased to notice, if they had ever noticed them at
all.  The self-content, the sex-content in the endless tide of young
men that thronged the streets and quads and parks; the all-sufficing
nature of sport or study, to whichever their inclinations tended.
The small part which womankind seemed to have in their lives.
Stephen had had, as we know, a peculiar training; whatever her
instincts were, her habits were largely boy habits.  Here she was
amongst boys, a glorious tide of them; it made now and again her
heart beat to look at them.  And yet amongst them all she was only an
outsider.  She could not do anything better than any of them.  Of
course, each time she went out, she became conscious of admiring
glances; she could not be woman without such consciousness.  But it
was as a girl that men looked at her, not as an equal.  As well as
personal experience and the lessons of eyes and ears and
intelligence, there were other things to classify and adjust; things
which were entirely from the outside of her own life.  The fragments
of common-room gossip, which it had been her fortune to hear
accidentally now and again.  The half confidences of scandals, borne
on whispered breaths.  The whole confidences of dormitory and study
which she had been privileged to share.  All were parts of the new
and strange world, the great world which had swum into her ken.

As she sat now in the train, with some formulation of memory already
accomplished in the two hours of solitude, her first comment, spoken
half audibly, would have surprised her teachers as much as it would
have surprised herself, if she had been conscious of it; for as yet
her thinking was not self-conscious:

'Surely, I am not like that!'

It was of the women she had been thinking, not of the men.  The
glimpse which she had had of her own sex had been an awakening to
her; and the awakening had not been to a pleasant world.  All at once
she seemed to realise that her sex had defects--littlenesses,
meannesses, cowardices, falsenesses.  That their occupations were apt
to be trivial or narrow or selfish; that their desires were earthly,
and their tastes coarse; that what she held to be goodness was apt to
be realised only as fear.  That innocence was but ignorance, or at
least baffled curiosity.  That . . .

A flood of shame swept over her, and instinctively she put her hands
before her burning face.  As usual, she was running all at once into
extremes.

And above all these was borne upon her, and for the first time in her
life, that she was herself a woman!

For a long time she sat quite still.  The train thrilled and roared
on its way.  Crowded stations took and gave their quantum of living
freight; but the young girl sat abstracted, unmoved, seemingly
unconscious.  All the dominance and energy of her nature were at
work.

If, indeed, she was a woman, and had to abide by the exigencies of
her own sex, she would at least not be ruled and limited by woman's
weakness.  She would plan and act and manage things for herself, in
her own way.

Whatever her thoughts might be, she could at least control her acts.
And those acts should be based not on woman's weakness, but on man's
strength!



CHAPTER VII--THE NEED OF KNOWING



When Stephen announced her intention of going with her father to the
Petty Sessions Court, there was consternation amongst the female
population of Normanstand and Norwood.  Such a thing had not been
heard of in the experiences of any of them.  Courts of Justice were
places for men; and the lower courts dealt with a class of cases . .
. It was quite impossible to imagine where any young lady could get
such an idea . . .

Miss Laetitia Rowly recognised that she had a difficult task before
her, for she was by now accustomed to Stephen's quiet method of
having her own way.

She made a careful toilet before driving over to Normanstand.  Her
wearing her best bonnet was a circumstance not unattended with dread
for some one.  Behold her then, sailing into the great drawing-room
at Normanstand with her mind so firmly fixed on the task before her
as to be oblivious of minor considerations.  She was so fond of
Stephen, and admired so truly her many beauties and fine qualities,
that she was secure and without flaw in her purpose.  Stephen was in
danger, and though she doubted if she would be able to effect any
change, she was determined that at least she should not go into
danger with her eyes unopened.

Stephen entered hastily and ran to her.  She loved her great-aunt;
really and truly loved her.  And indeed it would have been strange if
she had not, for from the earliest hour which she could recollect she
had received from her nothing but the truest, fondest affection.
Moreover she deeply respected the old lady, her truth, her
resolution, her kindliness, her genuine common-sense ability.
Stephen always felt safe with her aunt.  In the presence of others
she might now and again have a qualm or a doubt; but not with her.
There was an abiding calm in her love, answering love realised and
respected.  Her long and intimate knowledge of Laetitia made her
aware of her moods.  She could read the signs of them.  She knew well
the meaning of the bonnet which actually seemed to quiver as though
it had a sentience of its own.  She knew well the cause of her aunt's
perturbation; the pain which must be caused to her was perhaps the
point of most resistance in herself--she having made up her mind to
her new experience.  All she could do would be to try to reconcile
her by the assurance of good intention; by reason, and by sweetness
of manner.  When she had kissed her and sat beside her, holding her
hand after her pretty way, she, seeing the elder woman somewhat at a
loss, opened the subject herself:

'You look troubled, auntie!  I hope it is nothing serious?'

'It is, my dear!  Very serious!  Everything is serious to me which
touches you.'

'Me, Auntie!'  Hypocrisy is a fine art.

'Yes! yes, Stephen.  Oh! my dear child, what is this I hear about
your going to Petty Sessions with your father?'

'Oh, that!  Why, Auntie dear, you must not let that trouble you.  It
is all right.  That is necessary!'

'Necessary!' the old lady's figure grew rigid and her voice was loud
and high.  'Necessary for a young lady to go to a court house.  To
hear low people speaking of low crimes.  To listen to cases of the
most shocking kind; cases of low immorality; cases of a kind, of a
nature of a--a--class that you are not supposed to know anything
about.  Really, Stephen! .  .  . '  She was drawing away her hand in
indignation.  But Stephen held it tight, as she said very sweetly:

'That is just it, Auntie.  I am so ignorant that I feel I should know
more of the lives of those very people!'  Miss Laetitia interrupted:

'Ignorant!  Of course you are ignorant.  That is what you ought to
be.  Isn't it what we have all been devoting ourselves to effect ever
since you were born?  Read your third chapter of Genesis and remember
what came of eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge.'

'I think the Tree of Knowledge must have been an orange tree.'  The
old lady looked up, her interest aroused:

'Why?'

'Because ever since Eden other brides have worn its blossom!'  Her
tone was demure.  Miss Rowly looked sharply at her, but her sharpness
softened off into a smile.

'H'm!' she said, and was silent.  Stephen seized the opportunity to
put her own case:

'Auntie dear, you must forgive me!  You really must, for my heart is
set on this.  I assure you I am not doing it merely to please myself.
I have thought over the whole matter.  Father has always wished me to
be in a position--a position of knowledge and experience--to manage
Normanstand if I should ever succeed him.  From the earliest time I
can remember he has always kept this before me, and though of course
I did not at first understand what it meant, I have seemed in the
last few years to know better.  Accordingly I learned all sorts of
things under his care, and sometimes even without his help.  I have
studied the estate map, and I have been over the estate books and
read some of the leases and all such matters which they deal with in
the estate office.  This only told me the bones of the thing.  I
wanted to know more of our people; and so I made a point of going now
and again to each house that we own.  Of seeing the people and
talking with them familiarly; as familiarly as they would let me, and
indeed so far as was possible considering my position.  For, Auntie
dear, I soon began to learn--to learn in a way there was no
mistaking--what my position is.  And so I want to get to know more of
their ordinary lives; the darker as well as the lighter side.  I
would like to do them good.  I can see how my dear daddy has always
been a sort of power to help them, and I would like to carry on his
work; to carry it further if I may.  But I must know.'

Her aunt had been listening with growing interest, and with growing
respect too, for she realised the intense earnestness which lay
behind the girl's words and her immediate purpose.  Her voice and
manner were both softened:

'But, my dear, surely it is not necessary to go into the Court to
know these things.  The results of each case become known.'

'That is just it, Auntie,' she answered quickly.  'The magistrates
have to hear the two sides of the case before even they can make up
their minds.  I want to hear both sides, too!  If people are guilty,
I want to know the cause of their guilt.  If they are innocent, I
want to know what the circumstances can be which make innocence look
like guilt.  In my own daily life I may be in the way of just such
judgments; and surely it is only right that judgment should be just!'

Again she paused; there rose before her mind that conversation in the
churchyard when Harold had said that it was difficult for women to be
just.

Miss Rowly reflected too.  She was becoming convinced that in
principle the girl was right.  But the details were repugnant as ever
to her; concentrating her mind on the point where she felt the ground
firm under her, she made her objection:

'But, Stephen dear, there are so many cases that are sordid and
painful!'

'The more need to know of sordid things; if sordidness plays so
important a part in the tragedy of their lives!'

'But there are cases which are not within a woman's province.  Cases
that touch sin . . . '

'What kind of sin do you mean?  Surely all wrong-doing is sin!'  The
old lady was embarrassed.  Not by the fact, for she had been for too
many years the mistress of a great household not to know something of
the subject on which she spoke, but that she had to speak of such a
matter to the young girl whom she so loved.

'The sin, my dear, of . . . of woman's wrong-doing . . . as woman . .
. of motherhood, without marriage!'  All Stephen's nature seemed to
rise in revolt.

'Why, Auntie,' she spoke out at once, 'you yourself show the want of
the very experience I look for!'

'How? what?' asked the old lady amazed and bristling.  Stephen took
her hand and held it affectionately as she spoke:

'You speak of a woman's wrong-doing, when surely it is a man's as
well.  There does not seem to be blame for him who is the more
guilty.  Only for poor women! . . . And, Auntie dear, it is such poor
women that I should like to help . . . Not when it is too late, but
before!  But how can I help unless I know?  Good girls cannot tell
me, and good women won't!  You yourself, Auntie, didn't want to speak
on the subject; even to me!'

'But, my dear child, these are not things for unmarried women.  I
never speak of them myself except with matrons.'  Stephen's answer
flashed out like a sword; and cut like one:

'And yet you are unmarried!  Oh, Auntie dear, I did not and I do not
mean to be offensive, or to hurt you in any way.  I know, dear, your
goodness and your kindness to all.  But you limit yourself to one
side!'  The elder lady interrupted:

'How do you mean? one side! which side?'

'The punishment side.  I want to know the cause of that which brings
the punishment.  There surely is some cross road in a girl's life
where the ways part.  I want to stand there if I can, with warning in
one hand and help in the other.  Oh! Auntie, Auntie, can't you see
that my heart is in this . . . These are our people; Daddy says they
are to be my people; and I want to know their lives right through; to
understand their wants, and their temptations, and their weakness.
Bad and good, whatever it be, I must know it all; or I shall be
working in the dark, and may injure or crush where I had looked to
help and raise.'

As she spoke she looked glorified.  The afternoon autumn sun shone
full through the great window and lighted her up till she looked like
a spirit.  Lighted her white diaphanous dress till it seemed to take
shape as an ethereal robe; lighted her red hair till it looked like a
celestial crown; lighted her great dark eyes till their black beauty
became swept in the tide of glory.

The heart of the old woman who loved her best heaved, and her bosom
swelled with pride.  Instinctively she spoke:

'Oh, you noble, beautiful creature!  Of course you are right, and
your way is God's way!'  With tears that rained down her furrowed
cheeks, she put her arms round the girl and kissed her fondly.  Still
holding her in her arms she gave her the gentle counsel which was the
aftermath of her moment of inspiration.

'But Stephen dear, do be careful!  Knowledge is a two-edged sword,
and it is apt to side with pride.  Remember what was the last
temptation of the serpent to Eve:  ""Your eyes shall be opened, and ye
shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.""'

'I shall be very careful,' she said gravely; and then added as if by
an afterthought, 'of course you understand that my motive is the
acquisition of knowledge?'

'Yes?' the answer was given interrogatively.

'Don't you think, dear, that Eve's object was not so much the
acquisition of knowledge as the gratification of curiosity.'

'That may be,' said the elder lady in a doubtful tone; 'but my dear,
who is to enlighten us as to which is which?  We are apt in such
matters to deceive ourselves.  The more we know, the better are we
able to deceive others; and the better we are able to deceive others
the better we are able to deceive ourselves.  As I tell you, dear,
knowledge is two-edged and needs extra carefulness in its use!'

'True!' said Stephen reflectively.  Long after her aunt had gone she
sat thinking.


Once again did Miss Rowly try to restrain Stephen from a project.
This was when a little later she wished to go for a few days to the
University Mission House in the East end of London.  Ever since her
visit to Oxford she had kept up a correspondence with her mother's
old friend.  It was this lady's habit to spend a part of vacation in
the Mission; and Stephen had had much correspondence with her
regarding the work.  At last she wrote that if she might, she would
like to come and see for herself.  The answer was a cordial
invitation, armed with which she asked her father to allow her to go.
He at once assented.  He had been watching keenly the development of
her character, and had seen with pride and satisfaction that as time
went on she seemed to acquire greater resolution, larger self-
dependence.  She was becoming more and more of his ideal.  Without
losing any of her womanhood, she was beginning to look at things more
from a man's point of view than is usually done by, or possible to,
women.

When she returned at the end of a week she was full of new gravity.
After a while this so far changed that her old lighter moods began to
have their place, but it seemed that she never lost, and that she
never would lose, the effect of that week of bitter experience
amongst the 'submerged tenth.'

The effect of the mental working was shown by a remark made by Harold
when home on his next college vacation.  He had been entering with
her on a discussion of an episode on the estate:

'Stephen, you are learning to be just!'

At the moment she was chagrined by the remark, though she accepted it
in silence; but later, when she had thought the matter over, she took
from it infinite pleasure.  This was indeed to share man's ideas and
to think with the workings of man's mind.  It encouraged her to
further and larger ideas, and to a greater toleration than she had
hitherto dreamed of.

Of all those who loved her, none seemed to understand so fully as
Laetitia Rowly the change in her mental attitude, or rather the
development of it.  Now and again she tried to deflect or modify
certain coming forces, so that the educational process in which she
had always had a part would continue in the right direction.  But she
generally found that the girl had been over the ground so thoroughly
that she was able to defend her position.  Once, when she had
ventured to remonstrate with her regarding her attitude of woman's
equality with man, she felt as if Stephen's barque was indeed
entering on dangerous seas.  The occasion had arisen thus:  Stephen
had been what her aunt had stigmatised as 'laying down the law' with
regard to the position a married woman, and Miss Rowly, seeing a good
argumentative opening, remarked:

'But what if a woman does not get the opportunity of being married?'
Stephen looked at her a moment before saying with conviction:

'It is a woman's fault if she does not get the opportunity!'  The old
lady smiled as she answered:

'Her fault?  My dear, what if no man asks her?'  This seemed to her
own mind a poser.

'Still her own fault!  Why doesn't she ask him?'  Her aunt's lorgnon
was dropped in horrified amazement.

Stephen went on impassively.

'Certainly!  Why shouldn't she?  Marriage is a union.  As it is in
the eye of the law a civil contract, either party to it should be at
liberty to originate the matter.  If a woman is not free to think of
a man in all ways, how is she to judge of the suitability of their
union?  And if she is free in theory, why not free to undertake if
necessary the initiative in a matter so momentous to herself?'  The
old lady actually groaned and wrung her hands; she was horrified at
such sentiments.  They were daring enough to think; but to put them
in words! . . .

'Oh, my dear, my dear!' she moaned, 'be careful what you say.  Some
one might hear you who would not understand, as I do, that you are
talking theory.'  Stephen's habit of thought stood to her here.  She
saw that her aunt was distressed, and as she did not wish to pain her
unduly, was willing to divert the immediate channel of her fear.  She
took the hand which lay in her lap and held it firmly whilst she
smiled in the loving old eyes.

'Of course, Auntie dear, it is theory.  But still it is a theory
which I hold very strongly!' . . . Here a thought struck her and she
said suddenly:

'Did you ever . . . How many proposals did you have, Auntie?'  The
old lady smiled; her thoughts were already diverted.

'Several, my dear!  It is so long ago that I don't remember!'

'Oh yes, you do, Auntie!  No woman ever forgets that, no matter what
else she may or may not remember!  Tell me, won't you?'  The old lady
blushed slightly as she answered:

'There is no need to specify, my dear.  Let it be at this, that there
were more than you could count on your right hand!'

'And why did you refuse them?'  The tone was wheedling, and the elder
woman loved to hear it.  Wheedling is the courtship, by the young of
the old.

'Because, my dear, I didn't love them.'

'But tell me, Auntie, was there never any one that you did love?'

'Ah! my dear, that is a different matter.  That is the real tragedy
of a woman's life.'  In flooding reminiscent thought she forgot her
remonstrating; her voice became full of natural pathos:

'To love; and be helpless!  To wait, and wait, and wait; with your
heart all aflame!  To hope, and hope; till time seems to have passed
away, and all the world to stand still on your hopeless misery!  To
know that a word might open up Heaven; and yet to have to remain
mute!  To keep back the glances that could enlighten; to modulate the
tones that might betray!  To see all you hoped for passing away . . .
to another! . . . '

Stephen bent over and kissed her, then standing up said:

'I understand!  Isn't it wrong, Auntie, that there should be such
tragedies?  Should not that glance be given?  Why should that tone be
checked?  Why should one be mute when a single word might, would,
avert the tragedy?  Is it not possible, Auntie, that there is
something wrong in our social system when such things can happen; and
can happen so often?'

She looked remorseless as well as irresistible in the pride of her
youthful strength as with eyes that blazed, not flashing as in
passion but with a steady light that seemed to burn, she continued:

'Some day women must learn their own strength, as well as they have
learned their own weakness.  They are taught this latter from their
cradles up; but no one ever seems to teach them wherein their power
lies.  They have to learn this for themselves; and the process and
the result of the self-teaching are not good.  In the University
Settlement I learned much that made my heart ache; but out of it
there seemed some lesson for good.'  She paused; and her aunt,
wishing to keep the subject towards higher things, asked:

'And that lesson, Stephen dear?'  The blazing eyes turned to her so
that she was stirred by them as the answer came:

'It is bad women who seem to know men best, and to be able to
influence them most.  They can make men come and go at will.  They
can turn and twist and mould them as they choose.  And THEY never
hesitate to speak their own wishes; to ask for what they want.  There
are no tragedies, of the negative kind, in THEIR lives.  Their
tragedies have come and gone already; and their power remains.  Why
should good women leave power to such as they?  Why should good
women's lives be wrecked for a convention?  Why in the blind
following of some society fetish should life lose its charm, its
possibilities?  Why should love eat its heart out, in vain?  The time
will come when women will not be afraid to speak to men, as they
should speak, as free and equal.  Surely if a woman is to be the
equal and lifelong companion of a man, the closest to him--nay, the
only one really close to him:  the mother of his children--she should
be free at the very outset to show her inclination to him just as he
would to her.  Don't be frightened, Auntie dear; your eyes are
paining me! . . . There! perhaps I said too much.  But after all it
is only theory.  Take for your comfort, Auntie dear, that I am free
an heart-whole.  You need not fear for me; I can see what your dear
eyes tell me.  Yes!  I am very young; perhaps too young to think such
things.  But I have thought of them.  Thought them all over in every
way and phase I can imagine.'

She stopped suddenly; bending over, she took the old lady in her arms
and kissed her fondly several times, holding her tight.  Then, as
suddenly releasing her, she ran away before she could say a word.



CHAPTER VIII--THE T-CART



When Harold took his degree, Stephen's father took her to Cambridge.
She enjoyed the trip very much; indeed, it seemed under conditions
that were absolutely happy.

When they had returned to Normanstand, the Squire took an early
opportunity of bringing Harold alone into his study.  He spoke to him
with what in a very young man would have seemed diffidence:

'I have been thinking, Harold, that the time has come when you should
be altogether your own master.  I am more than pleased, my boy, with
the way you have gone through college; it is, I am sure, just as your
dear father would have wished it, and as it would have pleased him
best.'  He paused, and Harold said in a low voice:

'I tried hard, sir, to do what I thought he would like; and what you
would.'  The Squire went on more cheerfully:

'I know that, my boy!  I know that well.  And I can tell you that it
is not the least of the pleasures we have all had in your success,
how you have justified yourself.  You have won many honours in the
schools, and you have kept the reputation as an athlete which your
father was so proud of.  Well, I suppose in the natural order of
things you would go into a profession; and of course if you so desire
you can do that.  But if you can see your way to it I would rather
that you stayed here.  My house is your home as long as I live; but I
don't wish you to feel in any way dependent.  I want you to stay here
if you will; but to do it just because you wish to.  To this end I
have made over to you the estate at Camp which was my father's gift
to me when I came of age.  It is not a very large one; but it will
give you a nice position of your own, and a comfortable income.  And
with it goes my blessing, my dear boy.  Take it as a gift from your
father and myself!'

Harold was much moved, not only by the act itself but by the gracious
way of doing it.  There were tears in his eyes as he wrung the
Squire's hand; his voice thrilled with feeling as he said:

'Your many goodnesses to my father's son, sir, will, I hope, be
justified by his love and loyalty.  If I don't say much it is because
I do not feel quite master of myself.  I shall try to show in time,
as I cannot say it all at once, all that I feel.'

Harold continued to live at Normanstand.  The house at Camp was in
reality a charming cottage.  A couple of servants were installed, and
now and again he stayed there for a few days as he wished to get
accustomed to the place.  In a couple of months every one accepted
the order of things; and life at Normanstand went on much as it had
done before Harold had gone to college.  There was a man in the house
now instead of a boy:  that was all.  Stephen too was beginning to be
a young woman, but the relative positions were the same as they had
been.  Her growth did not seem to make an ostensible difference to
any one.  The one who might have noticed it most, Mrs. Jarrold, had
died during the last year of Harold's life at college.

When the day came for the quarterly meeting of the magistrates of the
county of Norcester, Squire Rowly arranged as usual to drive Squire
Norman.  This had been their habit for good many years.  The two men
usually liked to talk over the meeting as they returned home
together.  It was a beautiful morning for a drive, and when Rowly
came flying up the avenue in his T-cart with three magnificent bays,
Stephen ran out on the top of the steps to see him draw up.  Rowly
was a fine whip, and his horses felt it.  Squire Norman was ready,
and, after a kiss from Stephen, climbed into the high cart.  The men
raised their hats and waved good-bye.  A word from Rowly; with a
bound the horses were off.  Stephen stood looking at them delighted;
all was so sunny, so bright, so happy.  The world was so full of life
and happiness to-day that it seemed as if it would never end; that
nothing except good could befall.

Harold, later on that morning, was to go into Norcester also; so
Stephen with a lonely day before her set herself to take up loose-
ends of all sorts of little personal matters.  They would all meet at
dinner as Rowly was to stop the night at Normanstand.

Harold left the club in good time to ride home to dinner.  As he
passed the County Hotel he stopped to ask if Squire Norman had left;
and was told that he had started only a short time before with Squire
Rowly in his T-cart.  He rode on fast, thinking that perhaps he might
overtake them and ride on with them.  But the bays knew their work,
and did it.  They kept their start; it was only at the top of the
North hill, five miles out of Norcester, that he saw them in the
distance, flying along the level road.  He knew he would not now
overtake them, and so rode on somewhat more leisurely.

The Norcester highroad, when it has passed the village of Brackling,
turns away to the right behind the great clump of oaks.  From this
the road twists to the left again, making a double curve, and then
runs to Norling Parva in a clear stretch of some miles before
reaching the sharp turn down the hill which is marked 'Dangerous to
Cyclists.'  From the latter village branches the by-road over the
hill which is the short cut to Normanstand.

When Harold turned the corner under the shadow of the oaks he saw a
belated road-mender, surrounded by some gaping peasants, pointing
excitedly in the distance.  The man, who of course knew him, called
to him to stop.

'What is it?' he asked, reining up.

'It be Squire Rowly's bays which have run away with him.  Three on
'em, all in a row and comin' like the wind.  Squire he had his reins
all right, but they 'osses didn't seem to mind 'un.  They was fair
mad and bolted.  The leader he had got frightened at the heap o'
stones theer, an' the others took scare from him.'

Without a word Harold shook his reins and touched the horse with his
whip.  The animal seemed to understand and sprang forward, covering
the ground at a terrific pace.  Harold was not given to alarms, but
here might be serious danger.  Three spirited horses in a light cart
made for pace, all bolting in fright, might end any moment in
calamity.  Never in his life did he ride faster than on the road to
Norling Parva.  Far ahead of him he could see at the turn, now and
again, a figure running.  Something had happened.  His heart grew
cold:  he knew as well as though he had seen it, the high cart
swaying on one wheel round the corner as the maddened horses tore on
their way; the one jerk too much, and the momentary reaction in the
crash! . . .

With beating heart and eyes aflame in his white face he dashed on.

It was all too true.  By the side of the roadway on the inner curve
lay the cart on its side with broken shafts.  The horses were
prancing and stamping about along the roadway not recovered from
their fright.  Each was held by several men.

And on the grass two figures were still lying where they had been
thrown out.  Rowly, who had of course been on the off-side, had been
thrown furthest.  His head had struck the milestone that stood back
on the waste ground before the ditch.  There was no need for any one
to tell that his neck had been broken.  The way his head lay on one
side, and the twisted, inert limbs, all told their story plainly
enough.

Squire Norman lay on his back stretched out.  Some one had raised him
to a sitting posture and then lowered him again, straightening his
limbs.  He did not therefore look so dreadful as Rowly, but there
were signs of coming death in the stertorous breathing, the ooze of
blood from nostrils and ears as well as mouth.  Harold knelt down by
him at once and examined him.  Those who were round all knew him and
stood back.  He felt the ribs and limbs; so far as he could ascertain
by touch no bone was broken.

Just then the local doctor, for whom some one had run, arrived in his
gig.  He, too, knelt beside the injured man, a quick glance having
satisfied him that there was only one patient requiring his care.
Harold stood up and waited.  The doctor looked up, shaking his head.
Harold could hardly suppress the groan which was rising in his
throat.  He asked:

'Is it immediate?  Should his daughter be brought here?'

'How long would it take her to arrive?'

'Perhaps half an hour; she would not lose an instant.'

'Then you had better send for her.'

'I shall go at once!' answered Harold, turning to jump on his horse,
which was held on the road.

'No, no!' said the doctor, 'send some one else.  You had better stay
here yourself.  He may become conscious just before the end; and he
may want to say something!'  It seemed to Harold that a great bell
was sounding in his ears.--'Before the end!  Good God!  Poor
Stephen!' . . . But this was no time for sorrow, or for thinking of
it.  That would come later.  All that was possible must be done; and
to do it required a cool head.  He called to one of the lads he knew
could ride and said to him:

'Get on my horse and ride as fast as you can to Normanstand.  Send at
once to Miss Norman and tell her that she is wanted instantly.  Tell
her that there has been an accident; that her father is alive, but
that she must come at once without a moment's delay.  She had better
ride my horse back as it will save time.  She will understand from
that the importance of time.  Quick!'

The lad sprang to the saddle, and was off in a flash.  Whilst Harold
was speaking, the doctor had told the men, who, accustomed to hunting
accidents, had taken a gate from its hinges and held it in readiness,
to bring it closer.  Then under his direction the Squire was placed
on the gate.  The nearest house was only about a hundred yards away;
and thither they bore him.  He was lifted on a bed, and then the
doctor made fuller examination.  When he stood up he looked very
grave and said to Harold:

'I greatly fear she cannot arrive in time.  That bleeding from the
ears means rupture of the brain.  It is relieving the pressure,
however, and he may recover consciousness before he dies.  You had
better be close to him.  There is at present nothing that can be
done.  If he becomes conscious at all it will be suddenly.  He will
relapse and probably die as quickly.'

All at once Norman opened his eyes, and seeing him said quietly, as
he looked around:

'What place is this, Harold?'

'Martin's--James Martin's, sir.  You were brought here after the
accident.'

'Yes, I remember!  Am I badly hurt?  I can feel nothing!'

'I fear so, sir!  I have sent for Stephen.'

'Sent for Stephen!  Am I about to die?'  His voice, though feeble,
was grave and even.

'Alas! sir, I fear so!'  He sank on his knees as he spoke and took
him, his second father, in his arms.

'Is it close?'

'Yes.'

'Then listen to me!  If I don't see Stephen, give her my love and
blessing!  Say that with my last breath I prayed God to keep her and
make her happy!  You will tell her this?'

'I will!  I will!'  He could hardly speak for the emotion which was
choking him.  Then the voice went on, but slower and weaker:

'And Harold, my dear boy, you will look after her, will you not?
Guard her and cherish her, as if you were indeed my son and she your
sister!'

'I will.  So help me God!'  There was a pause of a few seconds which
seemed an interminable time.  Then in a feebler voice Squire Norman
spoke again:

'And Harold--bend down--I must whisper!  If it should be that in time
you and Stephen should find that there is another affection between
you, remember that I sanction it--with my dying breath.  But give her
time!  I trust that to you!  She is young, and the world is all
before her.  Let her choose . . . and be loyal to her if it is
another!  It may be a hard task, but I trust you, Harold.  God bless
you, my other son!'  He rose slightly and listened.  Harold's heart
leaped.  The swift hoof-strokes of a galloping horse were heard . . .
The father spoke joyously:

'There she is!  That is my brave girl!  God grant that she may be in
time.  I know what it will mean to her hereafter!'

The horse stopped suddenly.

A quick patter of feet along the passage and then Stephen half
dressed with a peignoir thrown over her, swept into the room.  With
the soft agility of a leopard she threw herself on her knees beside
her father and put her arms round him.  The dying man motioned to
Harold to raise him.  When this had been done he laid his hand
tenderly on his daughter's head, saying:

'Let now, O Lord, Thy servant depart in peace!  God bless and keep
you, my dear child!  You have been all your life a joy and a delight
to me!  I shall tell your mother when I meet her all that you have
been to me!  Harold, be good to her!  Good-bye--Stephen! . . .
Margaret! . . . '

His head fell over, and Harold, laying him gently down, knelt beside
Stephen.  He put his arm round her; and she, turning to him, laid her
hand on his breast and sobbed as though her heart would break.


The bodies of the two squires were brought to Normanstand.  Rowly had
long ago said that if he died unmarried he would like to lie beside
his half-sister, and that it was fitting that, as Stephen would be
the new Squire of Norwood, her dust should in time lie by his.  When
the terrible news of her nephew's and of Norman's death came to
Norwood, Miss Laetitia hurried off to Normanstand as fast as the
horses could bring her.

Her coming was an inexpressible comfort to Stephen.  After the first
overwhelming burst of grief she had settled into an acute despair.
Of course she had been helped by the fact that Harold had been with
her, and she was grateful for that too.  But it did not live in her
memory of gratitude in the same way.  Of course Harold was with her
in trouble!  He had always been; would always be.

But the comfort which Aunt Laetitia could give was of a more positive
kind.

From that hour Miss Rowly stayed at Normanstand.  Stephen wanted her;
and she wanted to be with Stephen.

After the funeral Harold, with an instinctive delicacy of feeling,
had gone to live in his own house; but he came to Normanstand every
day.  Stephen had so long been accustomed to consulting him about
everything that there was no perceptible change in their relations.
Even necessary business to be done did not come as a new thing.

And so things went on outwardly at Normanstand very much as they had
done before the coming of the tragedy.  But for a long time Stephen
had occasional bursts of grief which to witness was positive anguish
to those who loved her.

Then her duty towards her neighbours became a sort of passion.  She
did not spare herself by day or by night.  With swift intuition she
grasped the needs of any ill case which came before her, and with
swift movement she took the remedy in hand.

Her aunt saw and approved.  Stephen, she felt, was in this way truly
fulfilling her duty as a woman.  The old lady began to secretly hope,
and almost to believe, that she had laid aside those theories whose
carrying into action she so dreaded.

But theories do not die so easily.  It is from theory that practice
takes its real strength, as well as its direction.  And did the older
woman whose life had been bound under more orderly restraint but
know, Stephen was following out her theories, remorselessly and to
the end.



CHAPTER IX--IN THE SPRING



The months since her father's death spread into the second year
before Stephen began to realise the loneliness of her life.  She had
no companion now but her aunt; and though the old lady adored her,
and she returned her love in full, the mere years between them made
impossible the companionship that youth craves.  Miss Rowly's life
was in the past.  Stephen's was in the future.  And loneliness is a
feeling which comes unbidden to a heart.

Stephen felt her loneliness all round.  In old days Harold was always
within hail, and companionship of equal age and understanding was
available.  But now his very reticence in her own interest, and by
her father's wishes, made for her pain.  Harold had put his strongest
restraint on himself, and in his own way suffered a sort of silent
martyrdom.  He loved Stephen with every fibre of his being.  Day by
day he came toward her with eager step; day by day he left her with a
pang that made his heart ache and seemed to turn the brightness of
the day to gloom.  Night by night he tossed for hours thinking,
thinking, wondering if the time would ever come when her kisses would
be his . . . But the tortures and terrors of the night had their
effect on his days.  It seemed as if the mere act of thinking, of
longing, gave him ever renewed self-control, so that he was able in
his bearing to carry out the task he had undertaken:  to give Stephen
time to choose a mate for herself.  Herein lay his weakness--a
weakness coming from his want of knowledge of the world of women.
Had he ever had a love affair, be it never so mild a one, he would
have known that love requires a positive expression.  It is not
sufficient to sigh, and wish, and hope, and long, all to oneself.
Stephen felt instinctively that his guarded speech and manner were
due to the coldness--or rather the trusting abated worship--of the
brotherhood to which she had been always accustomed.  At the time
when new forces were manifesting and expanding themselves within her;
when her growing instincts, cultivated by the senses and the passions
of young nature, made her aware of other forces, new and old,
expanding themselves outside her; at the time when the heart of a
girl is eager for new impressions and new expansions, and the calls
of sex are working within her all unconsciously, Harold, to whom her
heart would probably have been the first to turn, made himself in his
effort to best show his love, a quantite negligeable.

Thus Stephen, whilst feeling that the vague desires of budding
womanhood were trembling within her, had neither thought nor
knowledge of their character or their ultimate tendency.  She would
have been shocked, horrified, had that logical process, which she
applied so freely to less personal matters, been used upon her own
intimate nature.  In her case logic would of course act within a
certain range; and as logic is a conscious intellectual process, she
became aware that her objective was man.  Man--in the abstract.
'Man,' not 'a man.'  Beyond that, she could not go.  It is not too
much to say that she did not ever, even in her most errant thought,
apply her reasoning, or even dream of its following out either the
duties, the responsibilities, or the consequences of having a
husband.  She had a vague longing for younger companionship, and of
the kind naturally most interesting to her.  There thought stopped.

One only of her male acquaintances did not at this time appear.
Leonard Everard, who had some time ago finished his course at
college, was living partly in London and partly on the Continent.
His very absence made him of added interest to his old play-fellow.
The image of his grace and comeliness, of his dominance and masculine
force, early impressed on her mind, began to compare favourably with
the actualities of her other friends; those of them at least who were
within the circle of her personal interest.  'Absence makes the heart
grow fonder.'  In Stephen's mind had been but a very mustard-seed of
fondness.  But new lights were breaking for her; and all of them, in
greater or lesser degree, shone in turn on the memory of the pretty
self-willed dominant boy, who now grew larger and more masculine in
stature under the instance of each successive light.  Stephen knew
the others fairly well through and through.  The usual mixture of
good and evil, of strength and weakness, of purpose and vacillation,
was quite within the scope of her own feeling and of her observation.
But this man was something of a problem to her; and, as such, had a
prominence in her thoughts quite beyond his own worthiness.

In movement of some form is life; and even ideas grow when the pulses
beat and thought quickens.  Stephen had long had in her mind the idea
of sexual equality.  For a long time, in deference to her aunt's
feelings, she had not spoken of it; for the old lady winced in
general under any suggestion of a breach of convention.  But though
her outward expression being thus curbed had helped to suppress or
minimise the opportunities of inward thought, the idea had never left
her.  Now, when sex was, consciously or unconsciously, a dominating
factor in her thoughts, the dormant idea woke to new life.  She had
held that if men and women were equal the woman should have equal
rights and opportunities as the man.  It had been, she believed, an
absurd conventional rule that such a thing as a proposal of marriage
should be entirely the prerogative of man.

And then came to her, as it ever does to woman, opportunity.
Opportunity, the cruelest, most remorseless, most unsparing, subtlest
foe that womanhood has.  Here was an opportunity for her to test her
own theory; to prove to herself, and others, that she was right.
They--'they' being the impersonal opponents of, or unbelievers in,
her theory--would see that a woman could propose as well as a man;
and that the result would be good.

It is a part of self-satisfaction, and perhaps not the least
dangerous part of it, that it has an increasing or multiplying power
of its own.  The desire to do increases the power to do; and desire
and power united find new ways for the exercise of strength.  Up to
now Stephen's inclination towards Leonard had been vague, nebulous;
but now that theory showed a way to its utilisation it forthwith
began to become, first definite, then concrete, then substantial.
When once the idea had become a possibility, the mere passing of time
did the rest.

Her aunt saw--and misunderstood.  The lesson of her own youth had not
been applied; not even of those long hours and days and weeks at
which she hinted when she had spoken of the tragedy of life which by
inference was her own tragedy:  'to love and to be helpless.  To
wait, and wait, and wait, with your heart all aflame!'

Stephen recognised her aunt's concern for her health in time to
protect herself from the curiosity of her loving-kindness.  Her youth
and readiness and adaptability, and that power of play-acting which
we all have within us and of which she had her share, stood to her.
With but little effort, based on a seeming acquiescence in her aunt's
views, she succeeded in convincing the old lady that her incipient
feverish cold had already reached its crisis and was passing away.
But she had gained certain knowledge in the playing of her little
part.  All this self-protective instinct was new; for good or ill she
had advanced one more step in not only the knowledge but the power of
duplicity which is so necessary in the conventional life of a woman.

Oh! did we but see!  Could we but see!  Here was a woman, dowered in
her youth with all the goods and graces in the power of the gods to
bestow, who fought against convention; and who yet found in
convention the strongest as well as the readiest weapon of defence.

For nearly two weeks Stephen's resolution was held motionless,
neither advancing nor receding; it was veritably the slack water of
her resolution.  She was afraid to go on.  Not afraid in sense of
fear as it is usually understood, but with the opposition of virginal
instincts; those instincts which are natural, but whose uses as well
as whose powers are unknown to us.



CHAPTER X--THE RESOLVE



The next few days saw Stephen abnormally restless.  She had fairly
well made up her mind to test her theory of equality of the sexes by
asking Leonard Everard to marry her; but her difficulty was as to the
doing it.  She knew well that it would not do to depend on a chance
meeting for an opportunity.  After all, the matter was too serious to
allow of the possibility of levity.  There were times when she
thought she would write to him and make her proffer of affection in
this way; but on every occasion when such thought recurred it was
forthwith instantly abandoned.  During the last few days, however,
she became more reconciled to even this method of procedure.  The
fever of growth was unabated.  At last came an evening which she had
all to herself.  Miss Laetitia was going over to Norwood to look
after matters there, and would remain the night.  Stephen saw in her
absence an opportunity for thought and action, and said that, having
a headache, she would remain at home.  Her aunt offered to postpone
her visit.  But she would not hear of it; and so she had the evening
to herself.

After dinner in her boudoir she set herself to the composition of a
letter to Leonard which would convey at least something of her
feelings and wishes towards him.  In the depths of her heart, which
now and again beat furiously, she had a secret hope that when once
the idea was broached Leonard would do the rest.  And as she thought
of that 'rest' a languorous dreaminess came upon her.  She thought
how he would come to her full of love, of yearning passion; how she
would try to keep towards him, at first, an independent front which
would preserve her secret anxiety until the time should come when she
might yield herself to his arms and tell him all.  For hours she
wrote letter after letter, destroying them as quickly as she wrote,
as she found that she had but swayed pendulum fashion between
overtness and coldness.  Some of the letters were so chilly in tone
that she felt they would defeat their own object.  Others were so
frankly warm in the expression of--regard she called it, that with
burning blushes she destroyed them at once at the candle before her.

At last she made up her mind.  Just as she had done when a baby she
realised that the opposing forces were too strong for her; she gave
in gracefully.  It would not do to deal directly in a letter with the
matter in hand.  She would write to Leonard merely asking him to see
her.  Then, when they were together without fear of interruption, she
would tell him her views.

She got as far as 'Dear Mr. Leonard,' when she stood up, saying to
herself:

'I shall not be in a hurry.  I must sleep on it before I write!'  She
took up the novel she had been reading in the afternoon, and read on
at it steadily till her bedtime.

That night she did not sleep.  It was not that she was agitated.
Indeed, she was more at ease than she had been for days; she had
after much anxious thought made up her mind to a definite course of
action.  Therefore her sleeplessness was not painful.  It was rather
that she did not want to sleep, than that she could not.  She lay
still, thinking, thinking; dreaming such dreams as are the occasions
of sanctified privacy to her age and sex.

In the morning she was no worse for her vigil.  When at luncheon-time
Aunt Laetitia had returned she went into all the little matters of
which she had to report.  It was after tea-time when she found
herself alone, and with leisure to attend to what was, she felt,
directly her own affair.  During the night she had made up her mind
exactly what to say to Leonard; and as her specific resolution bore
the test of daylight she was satisfied.  The opening words had in
their inception caused her some concern; but after hours of thought
she had come to the conclusion that to address, under the
circumstance, the recipient of the letter as 'Dear Mr. Everard' would
hardly do.  The only possible justification of her unconventional act
was that there existed already a friendship, an intimacy of years,
since childhood; that there were already between them knowledge and
understanding of each other; that what she was doing, and about to
do, was but a further step in a series of events long ago undertaken.

She thought it better to send by post rather than messenger, as the
latter did away with all privacy with regard to the act.

The letter was as follows:


'DEAR LEONARD,--Would it be convenient for you to meet me to-morrow,
Tuesday, at half-past twelve o'clock on the top of Caester Hill?  I
want to speak about a matter that may have some interest to you, and
it will be more private there than in the house.  Also it will be
cooler in the shade on the hilltop. -

Yours sincerely, STEPHEN NORMAN.'


Having posted the letter she went about the usual routine of her life
at Normanstand, and no occasion of suspicion or remark regarding her
came to her aunt.

In her room that night when she had sent away her maid, she sat down
to think, and all the misgivings of the day came back.  One by one
they were conquered by one protective argument:

'I am free to do as I like.  I am my own mistress; and I am doing
nothing that is wrong.  Even if it is unconventional, what of that?
God knows there are enough conventions in the world that are wrong,
hopelessly, unalterably wrong.  After all, who are the people who are
most bound by convention?  Those who call themselves ""smart!""  If
Convention is the god of the smart set, then it is about time that
honest people chose another!'


Leonard received the letter at breakfast-time.  He did not give it
any special attention, as he had other letters at the same time, some
of which were, if less pleasant, of more immediate importance.  He
had of late been bombarded with dunning letters from tradesmen; for
during his University life, and ever since, he had run into debt.
The moderate allowance his father made him he had treated as cash for
incidental expenses, but everything else had been on credit.  Indeed
he was beginning to get seriously alarmed about the future, for his
father, who had paid his debts once, and at a time when they were by
comparison inconsiderable, had said that he would not under any
circumstances pay others.  He was not sorry, therefore, for an
opportunity of getting away for a few hours from home; from himself--
from anxieties, possibilities.  The morning was a sweltering one, and
he grumbled to himself as he set out on his journey through the
woods.


Stephen rose fresh and in good spirits, despite her sleepless night.
When youth and strength are to the fore, a night's sleep is not of
much account, for the system once braced up is not allowed to
slacken.  It was a notable sign of her strong nature that she was not
even impatient, but waited with calm fixity the hour at which she had
asked Leonard Everard to meet her.  It is true that as the time grew
closer her nerve was less marked.  And just before it she was a girl-
-and nothing more; with all girl's difffideence, a girl's self-
distrust, a girl's abnegation, a girl's plasticity.

In the more purely personal aspect of her enterprise Stephen's effort
was more conscious.  It is hardly possible for a pretty woman to seek
in her study of perfection the aid of her mirror and to be
unconscious of her aims.  There must certainly be at least one
dominant purpose:  the achievement of success.  Stephen did not
attempt to deny her own beauty; on the contrary she gave it the
fullest scope.  There was a certain triumph in her glance as she took
her last look in her mirror; a gratification of her wish to show
herself in the best way possible.  It was a very charming picture
which the mirror reflected.

It may be that there is a companionship in a mirror, especially to a
woman; that the reflection of oneself is an emboldening presence, a
personality which is better than the actuality of an unvalued
stranger.  Certainly, when Stephen closed the door and stood in the
wainscoted passage, which was only dimly lit by the high window at
either end, her courage seemed at once to ooze away.

Probably for the first time in her life, as she left the shade of the
long passage and came out on the staircase flooded with the light of
the noonday sun, Stephen felt that she was a girl--'girl' standing as
some sort of synonym for weakness, pretended or actual.  Fear, in
whatever form or degree it may come, is a vital quality and must
move.  It cannot stand at a fixed point; if it be not sent backward
it must progress.  Stephen felt this, and, though her whole nature
was repugnant to the task, forced herself to the effort of
repression.  It would, she felt, have been to her a delicious
pleasure to have abandoned all effort; to have sunk in the lassitude
of self-surrender.

The woman in her was working; her sex had found her out!

She turned and looked around her, as though conscious of being
watched.  Then, seeing that she was alone, she went her way with
settled purpose; with flashing eyes and glowing cheeks--and a beating
heart.  A heart all woman's since it throbbed the most with
apprehension when the enemy, Man, was the objective of her most
resolute attack.  She knew that she must keep moving; that she must
not stop or pause; or her whole resolution must collapse.  And so she
hurried on, fearful lest a chance meeting with any one might imperil
her purpose.

On she went through the faint moss-green paths; through meadows rich
with flowering grasses and the many reds of the summer wild-flowers.
And so up through the path cut in the natural dipping of the rock
that rose over Caester Hill and formed a strong base for the clump of
great trees that made a landmark for many a mile around.  During the
first part of her journey between the house and the hilltop, she
tried to hold her purpose at arm's length; it would be sufficient to
face its terrors when the time had come.  In the meantime the matter
was of such overwhelming importance that nothing else could take its
place; all she could do was to suspend the active part of the
thinking faculties and leave the mind only receptive.

But when she had passed through the thin belt of stunted oak and
beech which hedged in the last of the lush meadows, and caught sight
of the clump of trees on the hilltop, she unconsciously braced
herself as a young regiment loses its tremors when the sight of the
enemy breaks upon it.  No longer her eyes fell earthward; they were
raised, and raised proudly.  Stephen Norman was fixed in her
intention.  Like the woman of old, her feet were on the ploughshares
and she would not hesitate.

As she drew near the appointed place her pace grew slower and slower;
the woman in her was unconsciously manifesting itself.  She would not
be first in her tryst with a man.  Unconsciousness, however, is not a
working quality which can be relied upon for staying power; the
approach to the trysting-place brought once more home to her the
strange nature of her enterprise.  She had made up her mind to it;
there was no use in deceiving herself.  What she had undertaken to do
was much more unconventional than being first at a meeting.  It was
foolish and weak to delay.  The last thought braced her up; and it
was with a hurried gait, which alone would have betrayed her to an
intelligent observer, that she entered the grove.



CHAPTER XI--THE MEETING



Had Stephen been better acquainted with men and women, she would have
been more satisfied with herself for being the first at the tryst.
The conventional idea, in the minds of most women and of all men, is
that a woman should never be the first.  But real women, those in
whom the heart beats strong, and whose blood can leap, know better.
These are the commanders of men.  In them sex calls to sex, all
unconsciously at first; and men answer to their call, as they to
men's.

Two opposite feelings strove for dominance as Stephen found herself
on the hilltop, alone.  One a feeling natural enough to any one, and
especially to a girl, of relief that a dreaded hour had been
postponed; the other of chagrin that she was the first.

After a few moments, however, one of the two militant thoughts became
dominant:  the feeling of chagrin.  With a pang she thought if she
had been a man and summoned for such a purpose, how she would have
hurried to the trysting-place; how the flying of her feet would have
vied with the quick rapturous beating of her heart!  With a little
sigh and a blush, she remembered that Leonard did not know the
purpose of the meeting; that he was a friend almost brought up with
her since boy and girl times; that he had often been summoned in
similar terms and for the most trivial of social purposes.

For nearly half an hour Stephen sat on the rustic seat under the
shadow of the great oak, looking, half unconscious of its beauty and
yet influenced by it, over the wide landscape stretched at her feet.

In spite of her disregard of conventions, she was no fool; the
instinct of wisdom was strong within her, so strong that in many ways
it ruled her conscious efforts.  Had any one told her that her
preparations for this interview were made deliberately with some of
the astuteness that dominated the Devil when he took Jesus to the top
of a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the earth at
His feet, she would have, and with truth, denied it with indignation.
Nevertheless it was a fact that she had, in all unconsciousness,
chosen for the meeting a spot which would evidence to a man,
consciously or unconsciously, the desirability for his own sake of
acquiescence in her views and wishes.  For all this spreading
landscape was her possession, which her husband would share.  As far
as the eye could reach was within the estate which she had inherited
from her father and her uncle.

The half-hour passed in waiting had in one way its advantages to the
girl:  though she was still as high strung as ever, she acquired a
larger measure of control over herself.  The nervous tension,
however, was so complete physically that all her faculties were
acutely awake; very early she became conscious of a distant footstep.

To Stephen's straining ears the footsteps seemed wondrous slow, and
more wondrous regular; she felt instinctively that she would have
liked to have listened to a more hurried succession of less evenly-
marked sounds.  But notwithstanding these thoughts, and the qualms
which came in their turn, the sound of the coming feet brought great
joy.  For, after all, they were coming; and coming just in time to
prevent the sense of disappointment at their delay gaining firm
foothold.  It was only when the coming was assured that she felt how
strong had been the undercurrent of her apprehension lest they should
not come at all.

Very sweet and tender and beautiful Stephen looked at this moment.
The strong lines of her face were softened by the dark fire in her
eyes and the feeling which glowed in the deep blushes which mantled
her cheeks.  The proudness of her bearing was no less marked than
ever, but in the willowy sway of her body there was a yielding of
mere sorry pride.  In all the many moods which the gods allow to good
women there is none so dear or so alluring, consciously as well as
instinctively, to true men as this self-surrender.  As Leonard drew
near, Stephen sank softly into a seat, doing so with a guilty feeling
of acting a part.  When he actually came into the grove he found her
seemingly lost in a reverie as she gazed out over the wide expanse in
front of her.  He was hot after his walk, and with something very
like petulance threw himself into a cane armchair, exclaiming as he
did so with the easy insolence of old familiarity:

'What a girl you are, Stephen! dragging a fellow all the way up here.
Couldn't you have fixed it down below somewhere if you wanted to see
me?'

Strangely enough, as it seemed to her, Stephen did not dislike his
tone of mastery.  There was something in it which satisfied her.  The
unconscious recognition of his manhood, as opposed to her womanhood,
soothed her in a peaceful way.  It was easy to yield to a dominant
man.  She was never more womanly than when she answered him softly:

'It was rather unfair; but I thought you would not mind coming so
far.  It is so cool and delightful here; and we can talk without
being disturbed.'  Leonard was lying back in his chair fanning
himself with his wide-brimmed straw hat, with outstretched legs wide
apart and resting on the back of his heels.  He replied with grudging
condescension:

'Yes, it's cool enough after the hot tramp over the fields and
through the wood.  It's not so good as the house, though, in one way:
a man can't get a drink here.  I say, Stephen, it wouldn't be half
bad if there were a shanty put up here like those at the Grands
Mulets or on the Matterhorn.  There could be a tap laid on where a
fellow could quench his thirst on a day like this!'

Before Stephen's eyes floated a momentary vision of a romantic chalet
with wide verandah and big windows looking over the landscape; a
great wide stone hearth; quaint furniture made from the gnarled
branches of trees; skins on the floor; and the walls adorned with
antlers, great horns, and various trophies of the chase.  And amongst
them Leonard, in a picturesque suit, lolling back just as at present
and smiling with a loving look in his eyes as she handed him a great
blue-and-white Munich beer mug topped with cool foam.  There was a
soft mystery in her voice as she answered:

'Perhaps, Leonard, there will some day be such a place here!'  He
seemed to grumble as he replied:

'I wish it was here now.  Some day seems a long way off!'

This seemed a good opening for Stephen; for the fear of the situation
was again beginning to assail her, and she felt that if she did not
enter on her task at once, its difficulty might overwhelm her.  She
felt angry with herself that there was a change in her voice as she
said:

'Some day may mean--can mean everything.  Things needn't be a longer
way off than we choose ourselves, sometimes!'

'I say, that's a good one!  Do you mean to say that because I am some
day to own Brindehow I can do as I like with it at once, whilst the
governor's all there, and a better life than I am any day?  Unless
you want me to shoot the old man by accident when we go out on the
First.'  He laughed a short, unmeaning masculine laugh which jarred
somewhat on her.  She did not, however, mean to be diverted from her
main purpose, so she went on quickly:

'You know quite well, Leonard, that I don't mean anything of the
kind.  But there was something I wanted to say to you, and I wished
that we should be alone.  Can you not guess what it is?'

'No, I'll be hanged if I can!' was his response, lazily given.

Despite her resolution she turned her head; she could not meet his
eyes.  It cut her with a sharp pain to notice when she turned again
that he was not looking at her.  He continued fanning himself with
his hat as he gazed out at the view.  She felt that the critical
moment of her life had come, that it was now or never as to her
fulfilling her settled intention.  So with a rush she went on her
way:

'Leonard, you and I have been friends a long time.  You know my views
on some points, and that I think a woman should be as free to act as
a man!'  She paused; words and ideas did not seem to flow with the
readiness she expected.  Leonard's arrogant assurance completed the
dragging her back to earth which her own self-consciousness began:

'Drive on, old girl!  I know you're a crank from Crankville on some
subjects.  Let us have it for all you're worth.  I'm on the grass and
listening.'

Stephen paused.  'A crank from Crankville!'--this after her nights of
sleepless anxiety; after the making of the resolution which had cost
her so much, and which was now actually in process of realisation.
Was it all worth so much? why not abandon it now? . . . Abandon it!
Abandon a resolution!  All the obstinacy of her nature--she classed
it herself as firmness--rose in revolt.  She shook her head angrily,
pulled herself together, and went on:

'That may be! though it's not what I call myself, or what I am
usually called, so far as I know.  At any rate my convictions are
honest, and I am sure you will respect them as such, even if you do
not share them.'  She did not see the ready response in his face
which she expected, and so hurried on:

'It has always seemed to me that a--when a woman has to speak to a
man she should do so as frankly as she would like him to speak to
her, and as freely.  Leonard, I--I,' as she halted, a sudden idea,
winged with possibilities of rescuing procrastination came to her.
She went on more easily:

'I know you are in trouble about money matters.  Why not let me help
you?'  He sat up and looked at her and said genially:

'Well, Stephen, you are a good old sort!  No mistake about it.  Do
you mean to say you would help me to pay my debts, when the governor
has refused to do so any more?'

'It would be a great pleasure to me, Leonard, to do anything for your
good or your pleasure.'

There was a long pause; they both sat looking down at the ground.
The woman's heart beat loud; she feared that the man must hear it.
She was consumed with anxiety, and with a desolating wish to be
relieved from the strain of saying more.  Surely, surely Leonard
could not be so blind as not to see the state of things! . . . He
would surely seize the occasion; throw aside his diffidence and
relieve her! . . . His words made a momentary music in her ears as he
spoke:

'And is this what you asked me to come here for?'

The words filled her with a great shame.  She felt herself a dilemma.
It had been no part of her purpose to allude his debts.  Viewed in
the light of what was to follow, it would seem to him that she was
trying to foreclose his affection.   That could not be allowed to
pass; the error must be rectified.  And yet! . . . And yet this very
error must be cleared up before she could make her full wish
apparent.  She seemed to find herself compelled by inexorable
circumstances into an unlooked-for bluntness.  In any case she must
face the situation.  Her pluck did not fail her; it was with a very
noble and graceful simplicity that she turned to her companion and
said:

'Leonard, I did not quite mean that.  It would be a pleasure to me to
be of that or any other service to you, if I might be so happy!  But
I never meant to allude to your debts.   Oh! Leonard, can't you
understand!  If you were my husband--or--or going to be, all such
little troubles would fall away from you.  But I would not for the
world have you think . . . '

Her very voice failed her.  She could not speak what was in her mind;
she turned away, hiding in her hands her face which fairly seemed to
burn.  This, she thought, was the time for a true lover's
opportunity!  Oh, if she had been a man, and a woman had so appealed,
how he would have sprung to her side and taken her in his arms, and
in a wild rapture of declared affection have swept away all the pain
of her shame!

But she remained alone.  There was no springing to her side; no
rapture of declared affection; no obliteration of her shame.  She had
to bear it all alone.  There, in the open; under the eyes that she
would fain have seen any other phase of her distress.  Her heart beat
loud and fast; she waited to gain her self-control.

Leonard Everard had his faults, plenty of them, and he was in truth
composed of an amalgam of far baser metals than Stephen thought; but
he had been born of gentle blood and reared amongst gentlefolk.  He
did not quite understand the cause or the amount of his companion's
concern; but he could not but recognise her distress.  He realised
that it had followed hard upon her most generous intention towards
himself.  He could not, therefore, do less than try to comfort her,
and he began his task in a conventional way, but with a blundering
awkwardness which was all manlike.  He took her hand and held it in
his; this much at any rate he had learned in sitting on stairs or in
conservatories after extra dances.  He said as tenderly as he could,
but with an impatient gesture unseen by her:

'Forgive me, Stephen!  I suppose I have said or done something which
I shouldn't.  But I don't know what it is; upon my honour I don't.
Anyhow, I am truly sorry for it.  Cheer up, old girl!  I'm not your
husband, you know; so you needn't be distressed.'

Stephen took her courage a deux mains.  If Leonard would not speak
she must.  It was manifestly impossible that the matter could be left
in its present state.

'Leonard,' she said softly and solemnly, 'might not that some day
be?'

Leonard, in addition to being an egotist and the very incarnation of
selfishness, was a prig of the first water.  He had been reared
altogether in convention.  Home life and Eton and Christchurch had
taught him many things, wise as well as foolish; but had tended to
fix his conviction that affairs of the heart should proceed on
adamantine lines of conventional decorum.  It never even occurred to
him that a lady could so far step from the confines of convention as
to take the initiative in a matter of affection.  In his blind
ignorance he blundered brutally.  He struck better than he knew, as,
meaning only to pass safely by an awkward conversational corner, he
replied:

'No jolly fear of that!  You're too much of a boss for me!'  The
words and the levity with which they were spoken struck the girl as
with a whip.  She turned for an instant as pale as ashes; then the
red blood rushed from her heart, and face and neck were dyed crimson.
It was not a blush, it was a suffusion.  In his ignorance Leonard
thought it was the former, and went on with what he considered his
teasing.

'Oh yes!  You know you always want to engineer a chap your own way
and make him do just as you wish.  The man who has the happiness of
marrying you, Stephen, will have a hard row to hoe!'  His 'chaff'
with its utter want of refinement seemed to her, in her high-strung
earnest condition, nothing short of brutal, and for a few seconds
produced a feeling of repellence.  But it is in the nature of things
that opposition of any kind arouses the fighting instinct of a
naturally dominant nature.  She lost sight of her femininity in the
pursuit of her purpose; and as this was to win the man to her way of
thinking, she took the logical course of answering his argument.  If
Leonard Everard had purposely set himself to stimulate her efforts in
this direction he could hardly have chosen a better way.  It came
somewhat as a surprise to Stephen, when she heard her own words:

'I would make a good wife, Leonard!  A husband whom I loved and
honoured would, I think, not be unhappy!'  The sound of her own voice
speaking these words, though the tone was low and tender and more
self-suppressing by far than was her wont, seemed to peal like
thunder in her own ears.  Her last bolt seemed to have sped.  The
blood rushed to her head, and she had to hold on to the arms of the
rustic chair or she would have fallen forward.

The time seemed long before Leonard spoke again; every second seemed
an age.  She seemed to have grown tired of waiting for the sound of
his voice; it was with a kind of surprise that she heard him say:

'You limit yourself wisely, Stephen!'

'How do you mean?' she asked, making a great effort to speak.

'You would promise to love and honour; but there isn't anything about
obeying.'

As he spoke Leonard stretched himself again luxuriously, and laughed
with the intellectual arrogance of a man who is satisfied with a
joke, however inferior, of his own manufacture.  Stephen looked at
him with a long look which began in anger--that anger which comes
from an unwonted sense of impotence, and ends in tolerance, the
intermediate step being admiration.  It is the primeval curse that a
woman's choice is to her husband; and it is an important part of the
teaching of a British gentlewoman, knit in the very fibres of her
being by the remorseless etiquette of a thousand years, that she be
true to him.  The man who has in his person the necessary powers or
graces to evoke admiration in his wife, even for a passing moment,
has a stronghold unconquerable as a rule by all the deadliest arts of
mankind.

Leonard Everard was certainly good to look upon as he lolled at his
ease on that summer morning.  Tall, straight, supple; a typical
British gentleman of the educated class, with all parts of the body
properly developed and held in some kind of suitable poise.

As Stephen looked, the anxiety and chagrin which tormented her seemed
to pass.  She realised that here was a nature different from her own,
and which should be dealt with in a way unsuitable to herself; and
the conviction seemed to make the action which it necessitated more
easy as well as more natural to her.  Perhaps for the first time in
her life Stephen understood that it may be necessary to apply to
individuals a standard of criticism unsuitable to self-judgment.  Her
recognition might have been summed up in the thought which ran
through her mind:

'One must be a little lenient with a man one loves!'

Stephen, when once she had allowed the spirit of toleration to work
within her, felt immediately its calming influence.  It was with
brighter thoughts and better humour that she went on with her task.
A task only, it seemed now; a means to an end which she desired.

'Leonard, tell me seriously, why do you think I gave you the trouble
of coming out here?'

'Upon my soul, Stephen, I don't know.'

'You don't seem to care either, lolling like that when I am serious!'
The words were acid, but the tone was soft and friendly, familiar and
genuine, putting quite a meaning of its own on them.  Leonard looked
at her indolently:

'I like to loll.'

'But can't you even guess, or try to guess, what I ask you?'

'I can't guess.  The day's too hot, and that shanty with the drinks
is not built yet.'

'Or may never be!'  Again he looked at her sleepily.

'Never be!  Why not?'

'Because, Leonard, it may depend on you.'

'All right then.  Drive on!  Hurry up the architect and the jerry-
builder!'

A quick blush leaped to Stephen's cheeks.  The words were full of
meaning, though the tone lacked something; but the news was too good.
She could not accept it at once; she decided to herself to wait a
short time.  Ere many seconds had passed she rejoiced that she had
done so as he went on:

'I hope you'll give me a say before that husband of yours comes
along.  He might be a blue-ribbonite; and it wouldn't do to start
such a shanty for rot-gut!'

Again a cold wave swept over her.  The absolute difference of feeling
between the man and herself; his levity against her earnestness, his
callous blindness to her purpose, even the commonness of his words
chilled her.  For a few seconds she wavered again in her intention;
but once again his comeliness and her own obstinacy joined hands and
took her back to her path.  With chagrin she felt that her words
almost stuck in her throat, as summoning up all her resolution she
went on:

'It would be for you I would have it built, Leonard!'  The man sat up
quickly.

'For me?' he asked in a sort of wonderment.

'Yes, Leonard, for you and me!'  She turned away; her blushes so
overcame her that she could not look at him.  When she faced round
again he was standing up, his back towards her.

She stood up also.  He was silent for a while; so long that the
silence became intolerable, and she spoke:

'Leonard, I am waiting!'  He turned round and said slowly, the
absence of all emotion from his face chilling her till her face
blanched:

'I don't think I would worry about it!'

Stephen Norman was plucky, and when she was face to face with any
difficulty she was all herself.  Leonard did not look pleasant; his
face was hard and there was just a suspicion of anger.  Strangely
enough, this last made the next step easier to the girl; she said
slowly:

'All right!  I think I understand!'

He turned from her and stood looking out on the distant prospect.
Then she felt that the blow which she had all along secretly feared
had fallen on her.  But her pride as well as her obstinacy now
rebelled.  She would not accept a silent answer.  There must be no
doubt left to torture her afterwards.  She would take care that there
was no mistake.  Schooling herself to her task, and pressing one hand
for a moment to her side as though to repress the beating of her
heart, she came behind him and touched him tenderly on the arm.

'Leonard,' she said softly, 'are you sure there is no mistake?  Do
you not see that I am asking you,' she intended to say 'to be my
husband,' but she could not utter the words, they seemed to stick in
her mouth, so she finished the sentence:  'that I be your wife?'

The moment the words were spoken--the bare, hard, naked, shameless
words--the revulsion came.  As a lightning flash shows up the
blackness of the night the appalling truth of what she had done was
forced upon her.  The blood rushed to her head till cheeks and
shoulders and neck seemed to burn.  Covering her face with her hands
she sank back on the seat crying silently bitter tears that seemed to
scald her eyes and her cheeks as they ran.

Leonard was angry.  When it began to dawn upon him what was the
purpose of Stephen's speech, he had been shocked.  Young men are so
easily shocked by breaches of convention made by women they respect!
And his pride was hurt.  Why should he have been placed in such a
ridiculous position!  He did not love Stephen in that way; and she
should have known it.  He liked her and all that sort of thing; but
what right had she to assume that he loved her?  All the weakness of
his moral nature came out in his petulance.  It was boyish that his
eyes filled with tears.  He knew it, and that made him more angry
than ever.  Stephen might well have been at a loss to understand his
anger, as, with manifest intention to wound, he answered her:

'What a girl you are, Stephen.  You are always doing something or
other to put a chap in the wrong and make him ridiculous.  I thought
you were joking--not a good joke either!  Upon my soul, I don't know
what I've done that you should fix on me!  I wish to goodness--'

If Stephen had suffered the red terror before, she suffered the white
terror now.  It was not injured pride, it was not humiliation, it was
not fear; it was something vague and terrible that lay far deeper
than any of these.  Under ordinary circumstances she would have liked
to have spoken out her mind and given back as good as she got; and
even as the thoughts whirled through her brain they came in a torrent
of vague vituperative eloquence.  But now her tongue was tied.
Instinctively she knew that she had put it out of her power to
revenge, or even to defend herself.  She was tied to the stake, and
must suffer without effort and in silence.

Most humiliating of all was the thought that she must propitiate the
man who had so wounded her.  All love for him had in the instant
passed from her; or rather she realised fully the blank, bare truth
that she had never really loved him at all.  Had she really loved
him, even a blow at his hands would have been acceptable; but now . .
.

She shook the feelings and thoughts from her as a bird does the water
from its wings; and, with the courage and strength and adaptability
of her nature, addressed herself to the hard task which faced her in
the immediate present.  With eloquent, womanly gesture she arrested
the torrent of Leonard's indignation; and, as he paused in surprised
obedience, she said:

'That will do, Leonard!  It is not necessary to say any more; and I
am sure you will see, later on, that at least there was no cause for
your indignation!  I have done an unconventional thing, I know; and I
dare say I shall have to pay for it in humiliating bitterness of
thought later on!  But please remember we are all alone!  This is a
secret between us; no one else need ever know or suspect it!'

She rose as she concluded.  The quiet dignity of her speech and
bearing brought back Leonard in some way to his sense of duty as a
gentleman.  He began, in a sheepish way, to make an apology:

'I'm sure I beg your pardon, Stephen.'  But again she held the
warning hand:

'There is no need for pardon; the fault, if there were any, was mine
alone.  It was I, remember, who asked you to come here and who
introduced and conducted this melancholy business.  I have asked you
several things, Leonard, and one more I will add--'tis only one:
that you will forget!'

As she moved away, her dismissal of the subject was that of an
empress to a serf.  Leonard would have liked to answer her; to have
given vent to his indignation that, even when he had refused her
offer, she should have the power to treat him if he was the one
refused, and to make him feel small and ridiculous in his own eyes.
But somehow he felt constrained to silence; her simple dignity
outclassed him.

There was another factor too, in his forming his conclusion of
silence.  He had never seen Stephen look so well, or so attractive.
He had never respected her so much as when her playfulness had turned
to majestic gravity.  All the boy and girl strife of the years that
had gone seemed to have passed away.  The girl whom he had played
with, and bullied, and treated as frankly as though she had been a
boy, had in an instant become a woman--and such a woman as demanded
respect and admiration even from such a man.



CHAPTER XII--ON THE ROAD HOME



When Leonard Everard parted from Stephen he did so with a feeling of
dissatisfaction:  firstly, with Stephen; secondly, with things in
general; thirdly, with himself.  The first was definite, concrete,
and immediate; he could give himself chapter and verse for all the
girl's misdoing.  Everything she had said or done had touched some
nerve painfully, or had offended his feelings; and to a man of his
temperament his feelings are very sacred things, to himself.

'Why had she put him in such a ridiculous position?  That was the
worst of women.  They were always wanting him to do something he
didn't want to do, or crying . . . there was that girl at Oxford.'

Here he turned his head slowly, and looked round in a furtive way,
which was getting almost a habit with him.  'A fellow should go away
so that he wouldn't have to swear lies.  Women were always wanting
money; or worse:  to be married!  Confound women; they all seemed to
want him to marry them!  There was the Oxford girl, and then the
Spaniard, and now Stephen!'  This put his thoughts in a new channel.
He wanted money himself.  Why, Stephen had spoken of it herself; had
offered to pay his debts.  Gad! it was a good idea that every one
round the countryside seemed to know his affairs.  What a flat he had
been not to accept her offer then and there before matters had gone
further.  Stephen had lots of money, more than any girl could want.
But she didn't give him time to get the thing fixed . . . If he had
only known beforehand what she wanted he could have come prepared . .
. that was the way with women!  Always thinking of themselves!  And
now?  Of course she wouldn't stump up after his refusing her.  What
would his father say if he came to hear of it?  And he must speak to
him soon, for these chaps were threatening to County Court him if he
didn't pay.  Those harpies in Vere Street were quite nasty . . . '
He wondered if he could work Stephen for a loan.

He walked on through the woodland path, his pace slower than before.
'How pretty she had looked!'  Here he touched his little moustache.
'Gad!  Stephen was a fine girl anyhow!  If it wasn't for all that red
hair . . . I like 'em dark better! . . . And her being such an
infernal boss!'. . . Then he said unconsciously aloud:

'If I was her husband I'd keep her to rights!'

Poor Stephen!

'So that's what the governor meant by telling me that fortune was to
be had, and had easily, if a man wasn't a blind fool.  The governor
is a starchy old party.  He wouldn't speak out straight and say,
""Here's Stephen Norman, the richest girl you are ever likely to meet;
why don't you make up to her and marry her?""  But that would be
encouraging his son to be a fortune-hunter!  Rot! . . . And now, just
because she didn't tell me what she wanted to speak about, or the
governor didn't give me a hint so that I might be prepared, I have
gone and thrown away the chance.  After all it mightn't be so bad.
Stephen is a fine girl! . . . But she mustn't ever look at me as she
did when I spoke about her not obeying.  I mean to be master in my
own house anyhow!

'A man mustn't be tied down too tight, even if he is married.  And if
there's plenty of loose cash about it isn't hard to cover up your
tracks . . . I think I'd better think this thing over calmly and be
ready when Stephen comes at me again.  That's the way with women.
When a woman like Stephen fixes her cold grey on a man she does not
mean to go asleep over it.  I daresay my best plan will be to sit
tight, and let her work herself up a bit.  There's nothing like a
little wholesome neglect for bringing a girl to her bearings!' . . .

For a while he walked on in satisfied self-complacency.

'Confound her! why couldn't she have let me know that she was fond of
me in some decent way, without all that formal theatrical proposing?
It's a deuced annoying thing in the long run the way the women get
fond of me.  Though it's nice enough in some ways while it lasts!' he
added, as if in unwilling recognition of fact.  As the path debouched
on the highroad he said to himself half aloud:

'Well, she's a mighty fine girl, anyhow!  And if she is red I've had
about enough of the black! . . . That Spanish girl is beginning to
kick too!  I wish I had never come across . . . '

'Shut up, you fool!' he said to himself as he walked on.

When he got home he found a letter from his father.  He took it to
his room before breaking the seal.  It was at least concise and to
the point:


'The enclosed has been sent to me.  You will have to deal with it
yourself.  You know my opinion and also my intention.   The items
which I have marked have been incurred since I spoke to you last
about your debts.  I shall not pay another farthing for you.  So take
your own course!

'JASPER EVERARD.'

The enclosed was a jeweller's bill, the length and the total of which
lengthened his face and drew from him a low whistle.   He held it in
his hand for a long time, standing quite still and silent.  Then
drawing a deep breath he said aloud:

'That settles it!  The halter is on me!  It's no use squealing.  If
it's to be a red head on my pillow! . . . All right!  I must only
make the best of it.  Anyhow I'll have a good time to-day, even if it
must be the last!'

That day Harold was in Norcester on business.  It was late when he
went to the club to dine.  Whilst waiting for dinner he met Leonard
Everard, flushed and somewhat at uncertain in his speech.  It was
something of a shock to Harold to see him in such a state.

Leonard was, however, an old friend, and man is as a rule faithful to
friends in this form of distress.  So in his kindly feeling Harold
offered to drive him home, for he knew that he could thus keep him
out of further harm.  Leonard thanked him in uncertain speech, and
said he would be ready.  In the meantime he would go and play
billiards with the marker whilst Harold was having his dinner.

At ten o'clock Harold's dogcart was ready and he went to look for
Leonard, who had not since come near him.  He found him half asleep
in the smoking-room, much drunker than he had been earlier in the
evening.

The drive was fairly long, so Harold made up his mind for a prolonged
term of uneasiness and anxiety.  The cool night-air, whose effect was
increased by the rapid motion, soon increased Leonard's somnolence
and for a while he slept soundly, his companion watching carefully
lest he should sway over and fall out of the trap.  He even held him
up as they swung round sharp corners.

After a time he woke up, and woke in a nasty temper.  He began to
find fault in an incoherent way with everything.  Harold said little,
just enough to prevent any cause for further grievance.  Then Leonard
changed and became affectionate.  This mood was a greater bore than
the other, but Harold managed to bear it with stolid indifference.
Leonard was this by time making promises to do things for him, that
as he was what he called a 'goo' fell',' he might count on his help
and support in the future.  As Harold knew him to be a wastrel, over
head and ears in debt and with only the succession to a small estate,
he did not take much heed to his maunderings.  At last the drunken
man said something which startled him so much that he instinctively
drew himself together with such suddenness as to frighten the horse
and almost make him rear up straight.

'Woa!  Woa!  Steady, boy.  Gently!' he said, quieting him.  Then
turning to his companion said in a voice hollow with emotion and
vibrant with suppressed passion:

'What was it you said?'

Leonard, half awake, and not half of that half master of himself,
answered:

'I said I will make you agent of Normanstand when I marry Stephen.'

Harold grew cold.  To hear of any one marrying Stephen was to him
like plunging him in a glacier stream; but to hear her name so
lightly spoken, and by such a man, was a bewildering shock which
within a second set his blood on fire.

'What do you mean?' he thundered.  'You marry Ste . . . Miss Norman!
You're not worthy to untie her shoe!  You indeed!  She wouldn't look
on the same side of the street with a drunken brute like you!  How
dare you speak of her in such a way!'

'Brute!' said Leonard angrily, his vanity reaching inward to heart
and brain through all the numbing obstacle of his drunken flesh.
'Who's brute?  Brute yourself!  Tell you goin' to marry Stephen, 'cos
Stephen wants it.  Stephen loves me.  Loves me with all her red head!
Wha're you doin'!  Wha!!'

His words merged in a lessening gurgle, for Harold had now got him by
the throat.

'Take care what you say about that lady! damn you!' he said, putting
his face close the other's with eyes that blazed.  'Don't you dare to
mention her name in such a way, or you will regret it longer than you
can think.  Loves you, you swine!'

The struggle and the fierce grip on his throat sobered Leonard
somewhat.  Momentarily sobbed him to that point when he could be
coherent and vindictive, though not to the point where he could think
ahead.  Caution, wisdom, discretion, taste, were not for him at such
a moment.  Guarding his throat with both hands in an instinctive and
spasmodic manner he answered the challenge:

'Who are you calling swine?  I tell you she loves me.  She ought to
know.  Didn't she tell me so this very day!'  Harold drew back his
arm to strike him in the face, his anger too great for words.  But
the other, seeing the motion and in the sobering recognition of
danger, spoke hastily:

'Keep your hair on!  You know so jolly much more than I do.  I tell
you that she told me this and a lot more this morning when she asked
me to marry her.'

Harold's heart grew cold as ice.  There is something in the sound of
a voice speaking truthfully which a true man can recognise.  Through
all Leonard's half-drunken utterings came such a ring of truth; and
Harold recognised it.  He felt that his voice was weak and hollow as
he spoke, thinking it necessary to give at first a sort of official
denial to such a monstrous statement:

'Liar!'

'I'm no liar!' answered Leonard.  He would like to have struck him in
answer to such a word had he felt equal to it.  'She asked me to
marry her to-day on the hill above the house, where I went to meet
her by appointment.  Here!  I'll prove it to you.  Read this!'
Whilst he was speaking he had opened the greatcoat and was fumbling
in the breast-pocket of his coat.  He produced a letter which he
handed to Harold, who took it with trembling hand.  By this time the
reins had fallen slack and the horse was walking quietly.  There was
moonlight, but not enough to read by.  Harold bent over and lifted
the driving-lamp next to him and turned it so that he could read the
envelope.  He could hardly keep either lamp or paper still, his hand
trembled so when he saw that the direction was in Stephen's
handwriting.  He was handing it back when Leonard said again:

'Open it!  Read it!  You must do so; I tell you, you must!  You
called me a liar, and now must read the proof that I am not.  If you
don't I shall have to ask Stephen to make you!'  Before Harold's mind
flashed a rapid thought of what the girl might suffer in being asked
to take part in such a quarrel.  He could not himself even act to the
best advantage unless he knew the truth . . . he took the letter from
the envelope and held it before the lamp, the paper fluttering as
though in a breeze from the trembling of his hand.  Leonard looked
on, the dull glare of his eyes brightening with malignant pleasure as
he beheld the other's concern.  He owed him a grudge, and by God he
would pay it.  Had he not been struck--throttled--called a liar! . .
.

As he read the words Harold's face cleared.  'Why, you infernal young
scoundrel!' he said angrily, 'that letter is nothing but a simple
note from a young girl to an old friend--playmate asking him to come
to see her about some trivial thing.  And you construe it into a
proposal of marriage.  You hound!'  He held the letter whilst he
spoke, heedless of the outstretched hand of the other waiting to take
it back.  There was a dangerous glitter in Leonard's eyes.  He knew
his man and he knew the truth of what he had himself said, and he
felt, with all the strength of his base soul, how best he could
torture him.  In the very strength of Harold's anger, in the
poignancy of his concern, in the relief to his soul expressed in his
eyes and his voice, his antagonist realised the jealousy of one who
honours--and loves.  Second by second Leonard grew more sober, and
more and better able to carry his own idea into act.

'Give me my letter!' he began.

'Wait!' said Harold as he put the lamp back into its socket.  'That
will do presently.  Take back what you said just now!'

'What?  Take back what?'

'That base lie; that Miss Norman asked you to marry her.'

Leonard felt that in a physical struggle for the possession of the
letter he would be outmatched; but his passion grew colder and more
malignant, and in a voice that cut like the hiss of a snake he spoke
slowly and deliberately.  He was all sober now; the drunkenness of
brain and blood was lost, for the time, in the strength of his cold
passion.

'It is true.  By God it is true; every word of it!  That letter,
which you want to steal, is only a proof that I went to meet her on
Caester Hill by her own appointment.  When I got there, she was
waiting for me.  She began to talk about a chalet there, and at first
I didn't know what she meant--'

There was such conviction, such a triumphant truth in his voice, that
Harold was convinced.

'Stop!' he thundered; 'stop, don't tell me anything.  I don't want to
hear.  I don't want to know.'  He covered his face with his hands and
groaned.  It was not as though the speaker were a stranger, in which
case he would have been by now well on in his death by strangulation;
he had known Leonard all his life, and he was a friend of Stephen's.
And he was speaking truth.

The baleful glitter of Leonard's eyes grew brighter still.  He was as
a serpent when he goes to strike.  In this wise he struck.

'I shall not stop.  I shall go on and tell you all I choose.  You
have called me liar--twice.  You have also called me other names.
Now you shall hear the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth.  And if you won't listen to me some one else will.'  Harold
groaned again; Leonard's eyes brightened still more, and the evil
smile on his face grew broader as he began more and more to feel his
power.  He went on to speak with a cold deliberate malignancy, but
instinctively so sticking to absolute truth that he could trust
himself to hurt most.  The other listened, cold at heart and
physically; his veins and arteries seemed stagnant.

'I won't tell you anything of her pretty embarrassments; how her
voice fell as she pleaded; how she blushed and stammered.  Why, even
I, who am used to women and their pretty ways and their passions and
their flushings and their stormy upbraidings, didn't quite know for a
while what she was driving at.  So at last she spoke out pretty
plainly, and told me what a fond wife she'd make me if I would only
take her!'  Harold said nothing; he only rocked a little as one in
pain, and his hands fell.  The other went on:

'That is what happened this morning on Caester Hill under the trees
where I met Stephen Norman by her own appointment; honestly what
happened.  If you don't believe me now you can ask Stephen.  My
Stephen!' he added in a final burst of venom as in a gleam of
moonlight through a rift in the shadowy wood he saw the ghastly
pallor of Harold's face.  Then he added abruptly as he held out his
hand:

'Now give me my letter!'

In the last few seconds Harold had been thinking.  And as he had been
thinking for the good, the safety, of Stephen, his thoughts flew
swift and true.  This man's very tone, the openness of his malignity,
the underlying scorn when he spoke of her whom others worshipped,
showed him the danger--the terrible immediate danger in which she
stood from such a man.  With the instinct of a mind working as truly
for the woman he loved as the needle does to the Pole he spoke
quietly, throwing a sneer into the tone so as to exasperate his
companion--it was brain against brain now, and for Stephen's sake:

'And of course you accepted.  You naturally would!'  The other fell
into the trap.  He could not help giving an extra dig to his opponent
by proving him once more in the wrong.

'Oh no, I didn't!  Stephen is a fine girl; but she wants taking down
a bit.  She's too high and mighty just at present, and wants to boss
a chap too much.  I mean to be master in my own house; and she's got
to begin as she will have to go on.  I'll let her wait a bit:  and
then I'll yield by degrees to her lovemaking.  She's a fine girl, for
all her red head; and she won't be so bad after all!'

Harold listened, chilled into still and silent amazement.  To hear
Stephen spoken of in such a way appalled him.  She of all women! . .
. Leonard never knew how near sudden death he was, as he lay back in
his seat, his eyes getting dull again and his chin sinking.  The
drunkenness which had been arrested by his passion was reasserting
itself.  Harold saw his state in time and arrested his own movement
to take him by the throat and dash him to the ground.  Even as he
looked at him in scornful hate, the cart gave a lurch and Leonard
fell forward.  Instinctively Harold swept an arm round him and held
him up.  As he did so the unconsciousness of arrested sleep came;
Leonard's chin sank on his breast and he breathed stertorously.

As he drove on, Harold's thoughts circled in a tumult.  Vague ideas
of extreme measures which he ought to take flashed up and paled away.
Intention revolved upon itself till its weak side was exposed, and,
it was abandoned.  He could not doubt the essential truth of
Leonard's statement regarding the proposal of marriage.  He did not
understand this nor did he try to.  His own love for the girl and the
bitter awaking to its futility made him so hopeless that in his own
desolation all the mystery of her doing and the cause of it was
merged and lost.

His only aim and purpose now was her safety.  One thing at least he
could do:  by fair means or foul stop Leonard's mouth, so that others
need not know her shame!  He groaned aloud as the thought came to
him.  Beyond this first step he could do nothing, think of nothing as
yet.  And he could not take this first step till Leonard had so far
sobered that he could understand.

And so waiting for that time to come, he drove on through the silent
night.



CHAPTER XIII--HAROLD'S RESOLVE



As they went on their way Harold noticed that Leonard's breathing
became more regular, as in honest sleep.  He therefore drove slowly
so that the other might be sane again before they should arrive at
the gate of his father's place; he had something of importance to say
before they should part.

Seeing him sleeping so peacefully, Harold passed a strap round him to
prevent him falling from his seat.  Then he could let his thoughts
run more freely.  Her safety was his immediate concern; again and
again he thought over what he should say to Leonard to ensure his
silence.

Whilst he was pondering with set brows, he was startled by Leonard's
voice at his side:

'Is that you, Harold?  I must have been asleep!'  Harold remained
silent, amazed at the change.  Leonard went on, quite awake and
coherent:

'By George!  I must have been pretty well cut.  I don't remember a
thing after coming down the stairs of the club and you and the hall-
porter helping me up here.  I say, old chap, you have strapped me up
all safe and tight.  It was good of you to take charge of me.  I hope
I haven't been a beastly nuisance!'  Harold answered grimly:

'It wasn't exactly what I should have called it!'  Then, after
looking keenly at his companion, he said:  'Are you quite awake and
sober now?'

'Quite.'  The answer came defiantly; there was something in his
questioner's tone which was militant and aggressive.  Before speaking
further Harold pulled up the horse.  They were now crossing bare
moorland, where anything within a mile could have easily been seen.
They were quite alone, and would be undisturbed.  Then he turned to
his companion.

'You talked a good deal in your drunken sleep--if sleep it was.  You
appeared to be awake!'  Leonard answered:

'I don't remember anything of it.  What did I say?'

'I am going to tell you.  You said something so strange and so wrong
that you must answer for it.  But first I must know its truth.'

'Must!  You are pretty dictatorial,' said Leonard angrily.  'Must
answer for it!  What do you mean?'

'Were you on Caester Hill to-day?'

'What's that to you?'  There was no mistaking the defiant,
quarrelsome intent.

'Answer me! were you?'  Harold's voice was strong and calm.

'What if I was?  It is none of your affair.  Did I say anything in
what you have politely called my drunken sleep?'

'You did.'

'What did I say?'

'I shall tell you in time.  But I must know the truth as I proceed.
There is some one else concerned in this, and I must know as I go on.
You can easily judge by what I say if I am right.'

'Then ask away and be damned to you!'  Harold's calm voice seemed to
quell the other's turbulence as he went on:

'Were you on Caester Hill this morning?'

'I was.'

'Did you meet Miss--a lady there?'

'What . . . I did!'

'Was it by appointment?'  Some sort of idea or half-recollection
seemed to come to Leonard; he fumbled half consciously in his breast-
pocket.  Then he broke out angrily:

'You have taken my letter!'

'I know the answer to that question,' said Harold slowly.  'You
showed me the letter yourself, and insisted on my reading it.'
Leonard's heart began to quail.  He seemed to have an instinctive
dread of what was coming.  Harold went on calmly and remorselessly:

'Did a proposal of marriage pass between you?'

'Yes!'  The answer was defiantly given; Leonard began to feel that
his back was against the wall.

'Who made it?'  The answer was a sudden attempt at a blow, but Harold
struck down his hand in time and held it.  Leonard, though a fairly
strong man, was powerless in that iron grasp.

'You must answer!  It is necessary that I know the truth.'

'Why must you?  What have you to do with it?  You are not my keeper!
Nor Stephen's; though I dare say you would like to be!'  The insult
cooled Harold's rising passion, even whilst it wrung his heart.

'I have to do with it because I choose.  You may find the answer if
you wish in your last insult!  Now, clearly understand me, Leonard
Everard.  You know me of old; and you know that what I say I shall
do.  One way or another, your life or mine may hang on your answers
to me--if necessary!'  Leonard felt himself pulled up.  He knew well
the strength and purpose of the man.  With a light laugh, which he
felt to be, as it was, hollow, he answered:

'Well, schoolmaster, as you are asking questions, I suppose I may as
well answer them.  Go on!  Next!'  Harold went on in the same calm,
cold voice:

'Who made the proposal of marriage?'

'She did.'

'Did . . . Was it made at once and directly, or after some
preliminary suggestion?'

'After a bit.  I didn't quite understand at first what she was
driving at.'  There was a long pause.  With an effort Harold went on:

'Did you accept?'  Leonard hesitated.  With a really wicked scowl he
eyed his big, powerfully-built companion, who still had his hand as
in a vice.  Then seeing no resource, he answered:

'I did not!  That does not mean that I won't, though!' he added
defiantly.  To his surprise Harold suddenly released his hand.  There
was a grimness in his tone as he said:

'That will do!  I know now that you have spoken the truth, sober as
well as drunk.  You need say no more.  I know the rest.  Most men--
even brutes like you, if there are any--would have been ashamed even
to think the things you said, said openly to me, you hound.  You
vile, traitorous, mean-souled hound!'

'What did I say?'

'I know what you said; and I shall not forget it.'  He went on, his
voice deepening into a stern judicial utterance, as though he were
pronouncing a sentence of death:

'Leonard Everard, you have treated vilely a lady whom I love and
honour more than I love my own soul.  You have insulted her to her
face and behind her back.  You have made such disloyal reference to
her and to her mad act in so trusting you, and have so shown your
intention of causing, intentionally or unintentionally, woe to her,
that I tell you here and now that you hold henceforth your life in
your hand.  If you ever mention to a living soul what you have told
me twice to-night, even though you should be then her husband; if you
should cause her harm though she should then be your wife; if you
should cause her dishonour in public or in private, I shall kill you.
So help me God!'

Not a word more did he say; but, taking up the reins, drove on in
silence till they arrived at the gate of Brindehow, where he signed
to him to alight.

He drove off in silence.

When he arrived at his own house he sent the servant to bed, and then
went to his study, where he locked himself in.  Then, and then only,
did he permit his thoughts to have full range.  For the first time
since the blow had fallen he looked straight in the face the change
in his own life.  He had loved Stephen so long and so honestly that
it seemed to him now as if that love had been the very foundation of
his life.  He could not remember a time when he had not loved her;
away back to the time when he, a big boy, took her, a little girl,
under his care, and devoted himself to her.  He had grown into the
belief that so strong and so consistent an affection, though he had
never spoken it or even hinted at it or inferred it, had become a
part of her life as well as of his own.  And this was the end of that
dreaming!  Not only did she not care for him, but found herself with
a heart so empty that she needs must propose marriage to another man!
There was surely something, more than at present he knew of or could
understand, behind such an act done by her.  Why should she ask
Everard to marry her?  Why should she ask any man?  Women didn't do
such things! . . . Here he paused.  'Women didn't do such things.'
All at once there came back to him fragments of discussions--in which
Stephen had had a part, in which matters of convention had been dealt
with.  Out of these dim and shattered memories came a comfort to his
heart, though his brain could not as yet grasp the reason of it.  He
knew that Stephen had held an unconventional idea as to the equality
of the sexes.  Was it possible that she was indeed testing one of her
theories?

The idea stirred him so that he could not remain quiet.  He stood up,
and walked the room.  Somehow he felt light beginning to dawn, though
he could not tell its source, or guess at the final measure of its
fulness.  The fact of Stephen having done such a thing was hard to
bear; but it was harder to think that she should have done such a
thing without a motive; or worse:  with love of Leonard as a motive!
He shuddered as he paused.  She could not love such a man.  It was
monstrous!  And yet she had done this thing . . . 'Oh, if she had had
any one to advise her, to restrain her!  But she had no mother!  No
mother!  Poor Stephen!'

The pity of it, not for himself but for the woman he loved, overcame
him.  Sitting down heavily before his desk, he put his face on his
hands, and his great shoulders shook.

Long, long after the violence of his emotion had passed, he sat there
motionless, thinking with all the power and sincerity he knew;
thinking for Stephen's good.

When a strong man thinks unselfishly some good may come out of it.
He may blunder; but the conclusion of his reasoning must be in the
main right.  So it was with Harold.  He knew that he was ignorant of
women, and of woman's nature, as distinguished from man's.  The only
woman he had ever known well was Stephen; and she in her youth and in
her ignorance of the world and herself was hardly sufficient to
supply to him data for his present needs.  To a clean-minded man of
his age a woman is something divine.  It is only when in later life
disappointment and experience have hammered bitter truth into his
brain, that he begins to realise that woman is not angelic but human.
When he knows more, and finds that she is like himself, human and
limited but with qualities of purity and sincerity and endurance
which put his own to shame, he realises how much better a helpmate
she is for man than could be the vague, unreal creations of his
dreams.  And then he can thank God for His goodness that when He
might have given us Angels He did give us women!

Of one thing, despite the seeming of facts, he was sure:  Stephen did
not love Leonard.  Every fibre of his being revolted at the thought.
She of so high a nature; he of so low.  She so noble; he so mean.
Bah! the belief was impossible.

Impossible!  Herein was the manifestation of his ignorance; anything
is possible where love is concerned!  It was characteristic of the
man that in his mind he had abandoned, for the present at all events,
his own pain.  He still loved Stephen with all the strength of his
nature, but for him the selfish side ceased to exist.  He was trying
to serve Stephen; and every other thought had to give way.  He had
been satisfied that in a manner she loved him in some way and in some
degree; and he had hoped that in the fulness of time the childish
love would ripen, so that in the end would come a mutual affection
which was of the very essence of Heaven.  He believed still that she
loved him in some way; but the future that was based on hope had now
been wiped out with a sudden and unsparing hand.  She had actually
proposed marriage to another man.  If the idea of a marriage with him
had ever crossed her mind she could have had no doubt of her feeling
toward another.  . . . And yet?  And yet he could not believe that
she loved Leonard; not even if all trains of reasoning should end by
leading to that point.  One thing he had at present to accept, that
whatever might be the measure of affection Stephen might have for
him, it was not love as he understood it.  He resolutely turned his
back on the thought of his own side of the matter, and tried to find
some justification of Stephen's act.

'Seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened to ye' has
perhaps a general as well as a special significance.  It is by
patient tireless seeking that many a precious thing has been found.
It was after many a long cycle of thought that the seeking and the
knocking had effectual result.  Harold came to believe, vaguely at
first but more definitely as the evidence nucleated, that Stephen's
act was due to some mad girlish wish to test her own theory; to prove
to herself the correctness of her own reasoning, the fixity of her
own purpose.  He did not go on analysing further; for as he walked
the room with a portion of the weight taken from his heart he noticed
that the sky was beginning to quicken.  The day would soon be upon
him, and there was work to be done.  Instinctively he knew that there
was trouble in store for Stephen, and he felt that in such an hour he
should be near her.  All her life she had been accustomed to him.  In
her sorrows to confide in him, to tell him her troubles so that they
might dwindle and pass away; to enhance her pleasures by making him a
sharer in them.

Harold was inspirited by the coming of the new day.  There was work
to be done, and the work must be based on thought.  His thoughts must
take a practical turn; what was he to do that would help Stephen?
Here there dawned on him for the first time the understanding of a
certain humiliation which she had suffered; she had been refused!
She who had stepped so far out of the path of maidenly reserve in
which she had always walked as to propose marriage to a man, had been
refused!  He did not, could not, know to the full the measure of such
humiliation to a woman; but he could guess at any rate a part.  And
that guessing made him grind his teeth in impotent rage.

But out of that rage came an inspiration.  If Stephen had been
humiliated by the refusal of one man, might not this be minimised if
she in turn might refuse another?  Harold knew so well the sincerity
of his own love and the depth of his own devotion that he was
satisfied that he could not err in giving the girl the opportunity of
refusing him.  It would be some sort of balm to her wounded spirit to
know that Leonard's views were not shared by all men.  That there
were others who would deem it a joy to serve as her slaves.  When she
had refused him she would perhaps feel easier in her mind.  Of course
if she did not refuse him . . . Ah! well, then would the gates of
Heaven open . . . But that would never be.  The past could not be
blotted out!  All he could do would be to serve her.  He would go
early.  Such a man as Leonard Everard might make some new
complication, and the present was quite bad enough.

It was a poor enough thing for him, he thought at length.  She might
trample on him; but it was for her sake.  And to him what did it
matter?  The worst had come.  All was over now!



CHAPTER XIV--THE BEECH GROVE



On the morning following the proposal Stephen strolled out into a
beech grove, some little distance from the house, which from
childhood had been a favourite haunt of hers.  It was not in the
immediate road to anywhere, and so there was no occasion for any of
the household or the garden to go through it or near it.  She did not
put on a hat, but took only a sunshade, which she used in passing
over the lawn.  The grove was on the side of the house away from her
own room and the breakfast-room.  When she had reached its shade she
felt that at last she was alone.

The grove was a privileged place.  Long ago a great number of young
beeches had been planted so thickly that as they grew they shot up
straight and branchless in their struggle for the light.  Not till
they had reached a considerable altitude had they been thinned; and
then the thinning had been so effected that, as the high branches
began to shoot out in the freer space, they met in time and
interlaced so closely that they made in many places a perfect screen
of leafy shade.  Here and there were rifts or openings through which
the light passed; under such places the grass was fine and green, or
the wild hyacinths in due season tinged the earth with blue.  Through
the grove some wide alleys had been left:  great broad walks where
the soft grass grew short and fine, and to whose edges came a
drooping of branches and an upspringing of undergrowth of laurel and
rhododendron.  At the far ends of these walks were little pavilions
of marble built in the classic style which ruled for garden use two
hundred years ago.  At the near ends some of them were close to the
broad stretch of water from whose edges ran back the great sloping
banks of emerald sward dotted here and there with great forest trees.
The grove was protected by a ha-ha, so that it was never invaded from
without, and the servants of the house, both the domestics and the
gardeners and grooms, had been always forbidden to enter it.  Thus by
long usage it had become a place of quiet and solitude for the
members of the family.

To this soothing spot had come Stephen in her pain.  The long spell
of self-restraint during that morning had almost driven her to
frenzy, and she sought solitude as an anodyne to her tortured soul.
The long anguish of a third sleepless night, following on a day of
humiliation and terror, had destroyed for a time the natural
resilience of a healthy nature.  She had been for so long in the
prison of her own purpose with Fear as warder; the fetters of
conventional life had so galled her that here in the accustomed
solitude of this place, in which from childhood she had been used to
move and think freely, she felt as does a captive who has escaped
from an irksome durance.  As Stephen had all along been free of
movement and speech, no such opportunities of freedom called to her.
The pent-up passion in her, however, found its own relief.  Her voice
was silent, and she moved with slow steps, halting often between the
green tree-trunks in the cool shade; but her thoughts ran free, and
passion found a vent.  No stranger seeing the tall, queenly girl
moving slowly through the trees could have imagined the fierce
passion which blazed within her, unless he had been close enough to
see her eyes.  The habit of physical restraint to which all her life
she had been accustomed, and which was intensified by the experience
of the past thirty-six hours, still ruled her, even here.  Gradually
the habit of security began to prevail, and the shackles to melt
away.  Here had she come in all her childish troubles.  Here had she
fought with herself, and conquered herself.  Here the spirits of the
place were with her and not against her.  Here memory in its second
degree, habit, gave her the full sense of spiritual freedom.

As she walked to and fro the raging of her spirit changed its
objective:  from restraint to its final causes; and chief amongst
them the pride which had been so grievously hurt.  How she loathed
the day that had passed, and how more than all she hated herself for
her part in it; her mad, foolish, idiotic, self-importance which gave
her the idea of such an act and urged her to the bitter end of its
carrying out; her mulish obstinacy in persisting when every fibre of
her being had revolted at the doing, and when deep in her inmost soul
was a deterring sense of its futility.  How could she have stooped to
have done such a thing:  to ask a man . . . oh! the shame of it, the
shame of it all!  How could she have been so blind as to think that
such a man was worthy! . . .

In the midst of her whirlwind of passion came a solitary gleam of
relief:  she knew with certainty that she did not love Leonard; that
she had never loved him.  The coldness of disdain to him, the fear of
his future acts which was based on disbelief of the existence of that
finer nature with which she had credited him, all proved to her
convincingly that he could never really have been within the charmed
circle of her inner life.  Did she but know it, there was an even
stronger evidence of her indifference to him in the ready manner in
which her thoughts flew past him in their circling sweep.  For a
moment she saw him as the centre of a host of besetting fears; but
her own sense of superior power nullified the force of the vision.
She was able to cope with him and his doings, were there such need.
And so her mind flew back to the personal side of her trouble:  her
blindness, her folly, her shame.

In truth she was doing good work for herself.  Her mind was working
truly and to a beneficent end.  One by one she was overcoming the
false issues of her passion and drifting to an end in which she would
see herself face to face and would place so truly the blame for what
had been as to make it a warning and ennobling lesson of her life.
She moved more quickly, passing to and fro as does a panther in its
cage when the desire of forest freedom is heavy upon it.

That which makes the irony of life will perhaps never be understood
in its casual aspect by the finite mind of man.  The 'why' and
'wherefore' and the 'how' of it is only to be understood by that All-
wise intelligence which can scan the future as well as the present,
and see the far far-reaching ramifications of those schemes of final
development to which the manifestation of completed character tend.

To any mortal it would seem a pity that to Stephen in her solitude,
when her passion was working itself out to an end which might be
good, should come an interruption which would throw it back upon
itself in such a way as to multiply its malignant force.  But again
it is a part of the Great Plan that instruments whose use man's
finite mind could never predicate should be employed:  the seeming
good to evil, the seeming evil to good.

As she swept to and fro, her raging spirit compelling to violent
movement, Stephen's eyes were arrested by the figure of a man coming
through the aisles of the grove.  At such a time any interruption of
her passion was a cause for heightening anger; but the presence of a
person was as a draught to a full-fed furnace.  Most of all, in her
present condition of mind, the presence of a man--for the thought of
a man lay behind all her trouble, was as a tornado striking a burning
forest.  The blood of her tortured heart seemed to leap to her brain
and to suffuse her eyes.  She 'saw blood'!

It mattered not that the man whom she saw she knew and trusted.
Indeed, this but added fuel to the flame.  In the presence of a
stranger some of her habitual self-restraint would doubtless have
come back to her.  But now the necessity for such was foregone;
Harold was her alter ego, and in his presence was safety.  He was, in
this aspect, but a higher and more intelligent rendering of the trees
around her.  In another aspect he was an opportune victim, something
to strike at.  When the anger of a poison snake opens its gland, and
the fang is charged with venom, it must strike at something.  It does
not pause or consider what it may be; it strikes, though it may be at
stone or iron.  So Stephen waited till her victim was within distance
to strike.  Her black eyes, fierce with passion and blood-rimmed as a
cobra's, glittered as he passed among the tree-trunks towards her,
eager with his errand of devotion.

Harold was a man of strong purpose.  Had he not been, he would never
have come on his present errand.  Never, perhaps, had any suitor set
forth on his quest with a heavier heart.  All his life, since his
very boyhood, had been centred round the girl whom to-day he had come
to serve.  All his thought had been for her:  and to-day all he could
expect was a gentle denial of all his hopes, so that his future life
would be at best a blank.

But he would be serving Stephen!  His pain might be to her good;
ought to be, to a certain extent, to her mental ease.  Her wounded
pride would find some solace . . . As he came closer the feeling that
he had to play a part, veritably to act one, came stronger and
stronger upon him, and filled him with bitter doubt as to his power.
Still he went on boldly.  It had been a part of his plan to seem to
come eagerly, as a lover should come; and so he came.  When he got
close to Stephen, all the witchery of her presence came upon him as
of old.  After all, he loved her with his whole soul; and the chance
had come to tell her so.  Even under the distressing conditions of
his suit, the effort had its charm.

Stephen schooled herself to her usual attitude with him; and that,
too, since the effort was based on truth came with a certain ease to
her.  At the present time, in her present frame of mind, nothing in
the wide world could give her pleasure; the ease which came, if it
did not change her purpose, increased her power.  Their usual
salutation, begun when she was a little baby, was 'Good morning,
Stephen!'  'Good morning, Harold!'  It had become so much a custom
that now it came mechanically on her part.  The tender reference to
childhood's days, though it touched her companion to the quick, did
not appeal to her since she had no special thought of it.  Had such a
thought come to her it might have softened her even to tears, for
Harold had been always deep in her heart.  As might have been
expected from her character and condition of mind, she was the first
to begin:

'I suppose you want to see me about something special, Harold, you
have come so early.'

'Yes, Stephen.  Very special!'

'Were you at the house?' she asked in a voice whose quietness might
have conveyed a warning.  She was so suspicious now that she
suspected even Harold of--of what she did not know.  He answered in
all simplicity:

'No.  I came straight here.'

'How did you know I should be here?'  Her voice was now not only
quiet but sweet.  Without thinking, Harold blundered on.  His
intention was so single-minded, and his ignorance of woman so
complete, that he did not recognise even elementary truths:

'I knew you always came here long ago when you were a child when you
were in--'  Here it suddenly flashed upon him that if he seemed to
expect that she was in trouble as he had purposed saying, he would
give away his knowledge of what had happened and so destroy the work
to which he had set himself.  So he finished the sentence in a lame
and impotent manner, which, however, saved complete annihilation as
it was verbally accurate:  'in short frocks.'  Stephen needed to know
little more.  Her quick intelligence grasped the fact that there was
some purpose afoot which she did not know or understand.  She
surmised, of course, that it was some way in connection with her mad
act, and she grew cooler in her brain as well as colder in her heart
as she prepared to learn more.  Stephen had changed from girl to
woman in the last twenty-four hours; and all the woman in her was now
awake.  After a moment's pause she said with a winning smile:

'Why, Harold, I've been in long frocks for years.  Why should I come
here on this special day on that account?'  Even as she was speaking
she felt that it would be well to abandon this ground of inquiry.  It
had clearly told her all it could.  She would learn more by some
other means.  So she went on in a playful way, as a cat--not a
kitten--does when it has got a mouse:

'That reason won't work, Harold.  It's quite rusty in the joints.
But never mind it!  Tell me why you have come so early?'  This seemed
to Harold to be a heaven-sent opening; he rushed in at once:

'Because, Stephen, I wanted to ask you to be my wife!  Oh! Stephen,
don't you know that I love you?  Ever since you were a little girl!
When you were a little girl and I a big boy I loved you.  I have
loved you ever since with all my heart, and soul, and strength.
Without you the world is a blank to me!  For you and your happiness I
would do anything--anything!'

This was no acting.  When once the barrier of beginning had been
broken, his soul seemed to pour itself out.  The man was vibrant
through all his nature; and the woman's very soul realised its truth.
For an instant a flame of gladness swept through her; and for the
time it lasted put all other thought aside.

But suspicion is a hard metal which does not easily yield to fire.
It can come to white heat easily enough, but its melting-point is
high indeed.  When the flame had leaped it had spent its force; the
reaction came quick.  Stephen's heart seemed to turn to ice, all the
heat and life rushing to her brain.  Her thoughts flashed with
convincing quickness; there was no time for doubting amid their rush.
Her life was for good or ill at the crossing of the ways.  She had
trusted Harold thoroughly.  The habit of her whole life from her
babyhood up had been to so look to him as comrade and protector and
sympathetic friend.  She was so absolutely sure of his earnest
devotion that this new experience of a riper feeling would have been
a joy to her, if it should be that his act was all spontaneous and
done in ignorance of her shame.  'Shame' was the generic word which
now summarised to herself her thought of her conduct in proposing to
Leonard.  But of this she must be certain.  She could not, dare not,
go farther till this was settled.  With the same craving for
certainty with which she convinced herself that Leonard understood
her overtures, and with the same dogged courage with which she
pressed the matter on him, she now went on to satisfy her mind.

'What did you do yesterday?'

'I was at Norcester all day.  I went early.  By the way, here is the
ribbon you wanted; I think it's exactly the same as the pattern.'  As
he spoke he took a tissue-piper parcel from his pocket and handed it
to her.

'Thanks!' she said.  'Did you meet any friends there?'

'Not many.'  He answered guardedly; he had a secret to keep.

'Where did you dine?'

'At the club!'  He began to be uneasy at this questioning; but he did
not see any way to avoid answering without creating some suspicion.

'Did you see any one you knew at the club?'  Her voice as she spoke
was a little harder, a little more strained.  Harold noticed the
change, rather by instinct than reason.  He felt that there was
danger in it, and paused.  The pause seemed to suddenly create a new
fury in the breast of Stephen.  She felt that Harold was playing with
her.  Harold!  If she could not trust him, where then was she to look
for trust in the world?  If he was not frank with her, what then
meant his early coming; his seeking her in the grove; his proposal of
marriage, which seemed so sudden and so inopportune?  He must have
seen Leonard, and by some means have become acquainted with her
secret of shame . . . His motive?

Here her mind halted.  She knew as well as if it had been trumpeted
from the skies that Harold knew all.  But she must be certain . . .
Certain!

She was standing erect, her hands held down by her sides and clenched
together till the knuckles were white; all her body strung high--like
an over-pitched violin.  Now she raised her right hand and flung it
downward with a passionate jerk.

'Answer me!' she cried imperiously.  'Answer me!  Why are you playing
with me?  Did you see Leonard Everard last night?  Answer me, I say.
Harold An Wolf, you do not lie!  Answer me!'

As she spoke Harold grew cold.  From the question he now knew that
Stephen had guessed his secret.  The fat was in the fire with a
vengeance.  He did not know what to do, and still remained silent.
She did not give him time to think, but spoke again, this time more
coldly.  The white terror had replaced the red:

'Are you not going to answer me a simple question, Harold?  To be
silent now is to wrong me!  I have a right to know!'

In his trouble, for he felt that say what he would he could only give
her new pain, he said humbly:

'Don't ask me, Stephen!  Won't you understand that I want to do what
is best for you?  Won't you trust me?'  Her answer came harshly.  A
more experienced man than Harold, one who knew women better, would
have seen how overwrought she was, and would have made pity the pivot
of his future bearing and acts and words while the interview lasted;
pity, and pity only.  But to Harold the high ideal was ever the same.
The Stephen whom he loved was no subject for pity, but for devotion
only.  He knew the nobility of her nature and must trust it to the
end.  When her silence and her blazing eyes denied his request, he
answered her query in a low voice:

'I did!'  Even whilst he spoke he was thankful for one thing, he had
not been pledged in any way to confidence.  Leonard had forced the
knowledge on him; and though he would have preferred a million times
over to be silent, he was still free to speak.  Stephen's next
question came more coldly still:

'Did he tell you of his meeting with me?'

'He did.'

'Did he tell you all?'  It was torture to him to answer; but he was
at the stake and must bear it.

'I think so!  If it was true.'

'What did he tell you?  Stay!  I shall ask you the facts myself; the
broad facts.  We need not go into details . . . '

'Oh, Stephen!'  She silenced his pleading with an imperious hand.

'If I can go into this matter, surely you can.  If I can bear the
shame of telling, you can at least bear that of listening.  Remember
that knowing--knowing what you know, or at least what you have heard-
-you could come here and propose marriaage  to me!'  This she said with
a cold, cutting sarcasm which sounded like the rasping of a roughly-
sharpened knife through raw flesh.  Harold groaned in spirit; he felt
a weakness which began at his heart to steal through him.  It took
all his manhood to bear himself erect.  He dreaded what was coming,
as of old the once-tortured victim dreaded the coming torment of the
rack.



CHAPTER XV--THE END OF THE MEETING



Stephen went on in her calm, cold voice:

'Did he tell you that I had asked him to marry me?'  Despite herself,
as she spoke the words a red tide dyed her face.  It was not a flush;
it was not a blush; it was a sort of flood which swept through her,
leaving her in a few seconds whiter than before.  Harold saw and
understood.  He could not speak; he lowered his head silently.  Her
eyes glittered more coldly.  The madness that every human being may
have once was upon her.  Such a madness is destructive, and here was
something more vulnerable than herself.

'Did he tell you how I pressed him?'  There was no red tide this
time, nor ever again whilst the interview lasted.  To bow in
affirmation was insufficient; with an effort he answered:

'I understood so.'  She answered with an icy sarcasm:

'You understood so!  Oh, I don't doubt he embellished the record with
some of his own pleasantries.  But you understood it; and that is
sufficient.'  After a pause she went on:

'Did he tell you that he had refused me?'

'Yes!'  Harold knew now that he was under the torture, and that there
was no refusing.  She went on, with a light laugh, which wrung his
heart even more than her pain had done . . . Stephen to laugh like
that!

'And I have no doubt that he embellished that too, with some of his
fine masculine witticisms.  I understood myself that he was offended
at my asking him.  I understood it quite well; he told me so!'  Then
with feminine intuition she went on:

'I dare say that before he was done he said something kindly of the
poor little thing that loved him; that loved him so much, and that
she had to break down all the bounds of modesty and decorum that had
made the women of her house honoured for a thousand years!  And you
listened to him whilst he spoke!  Oh-h-h!' she quivered with her
white-hot anger, as the fierce heat in the heart of a furnace
quivers.  But her voice was cold again as she went on:

'But who could help loving him?  Girls always did.  It was such a
beastly nuisance!  You ""understood"" all that, I dare say; though
perhaps he did not put it in such plain words!'  Then the scorn,
which up to now had been imprisoned, turned on him; and he felt as
though some hose of deathly chill was being played upon him.

'And yet you, knowing that only yesterday, he had refused me--refused
my pressing request that he should marry me, come to me hot-foot in
the early morning and ask me to be your wife.  I thought such things
did not take place; that men were more honourable, or more
considerate, or more merciful!  Or at least I used to think so; till
yesterday.  No! till to-day.  Yesterday's doings were my own doings,
and I had to bear the penalty of them myself.  I had come here to
fight out by myself the battle of my shame . . . '

Here Harold interrupted her.  He could not bear to hear Stephen use
such a word in connection with herself.

'No!  You must not say ""shame.""  There is no shame to you, Stephen.
There can be none, and no one must say it in my presence!'  In her
secret heart of hearts she admired him for his words; she felt them
at the moment sink into her memory, and knew that she would never
forget the mastery of his face and bearing.  But the blindness of
rage was upon her, and it is of the essence of this white-hot anger
that it preys not on what is basest in us, but on what is best.  That
Harold felt deeply was her opportunity to wound him more deeply than
before.

'Even here in the solitude which I had chosen as the battleground of
my shame you had need to come unasked, unthought of, when even a
lesser mind than yours, for you are no fool, would have thought to
leave me alone.  My shame was my own, I tell you; and I was learning
to take my punishment.  My punishment!  Poor creatures that we are,
we think our punishment will be what we would like best:  to suffer
in silence, and not to have spread abroad our shame!'  How she harped
on that word, though she knew that every time she uttered it, it cut
to the heart of the man who loved her.  'And yet you come right on
top of my torture to torture me still more and illimitably.  You
come, you who alone had the power to intrude yourself on my grief and
sorrow; power given you by my father's kindness.  You come to me
without warning, considerately telling me that you knew I would be
here because I had always come here when I had been in trouble.  No--
I do you an injustice.  ""In trouble"" was not what you said, but that
I had come when I had been in short frocks.  Short frocks!  And you
came to tell me that you loved me.  You thought, I suppose, that as I
had refused one man, I would jump at the next that came along.  I
wanted a man.  God! God! what have I done that such an affront should
come upon me?  And come, too, from a hand that should have protected
me if only in gratitude for my father's kindness!'  She was eyeing
him keenly, with eyes that in her unflinching anger took in
everything with the accuracy of sun-painting.  She wanted to wound;
and she succeeded.

But Harold had nerves and muscles of steel; and when the call came to
them they answered.  Though the pain of death was upon him he did not
flinch.  He stood before her like a rock, in all his great manhood;
but a rock on whose summit the waves had cast the wealth of their
foam, for his face was as white as snow.  She saw and understood; but
in the madness upon her she went on trying new places and new ways to
wound:

'You thought, I suppose, that this poor, neglected, despised,
rejected woman, who wanted so much to marry that she couldn't wait
for a man to ask her, would hand herself over to the first chance
comer who threw his handkerchief to her; would hand over herself--and
her fortune!'

'Oh, Stephen!  How can you say such things, think such things?'  The
protest broke from him with a groan.  His pain seemed to inflame her
still further; to gratify her hate, and to stimulate her mad passion:

'Why did I ever see you at all?  Why did my father treat you as a
son; that when you had grown and got strong on his kindness you could
thus insult his daughter in the darkest hour of her pain and her
shame!'  She almost choked with passion.  There was now nothing in
the whole world that she could trust.  In the pause he spoke:

'Stephen, I never meant you harm.  Oh, don't speak such wild words.
They will come back to you with sorrow afterwards!  I only meant to
do you good.  I wanted . . . '  Her anger broke out afresh:

'There; you speak it yourself!  You only wanted to do me good.  I was
so bad that any kind of a husband . . . Oh, get out of my sight!  I
wish to God I had never seen you!  I hope to God I may never see you
again!  Go!  Go!  Go!'

This was the end!  To Harold's honest mind such words would have been
impossible had not thoughts of truth lain behind them.  That Stephen-
-his Stephen, whose image in his mind sshutt out every other woman in
the world, past, present, and future--should say such things to any
one, that she should think such things, was to him a deadly blow.
But that she should say them to him! . . . Utterance, even the
utterance which speaks in the inmost soul, failed him.  He had in
some way that he knew not hurt--wounded--killed Stephen; for the
finer part was gone from the Stephen that he had known and worshipped
so long.  She wished him gone; she wished she had never seen him; she
hoped to God never to see him again.  Life for him was over and done!
There could be no more happiness in the world; no more wish to work,
to live! . . .

He bowed gravely; and without a word turned and walked away.

Stephen saw him go, his tall form moving amongst the tree trunks till
finally it was lost in their massing.  She was so filled with the
tumult of her passion that she looked, unmoved.  Even the sense of
his going did not change her mood.  She raged to and fro amongst the
trees, her movements getting quicker and quicker as her excitement
began to change from mental to physical; till the fury began to
exhaust itself.  All at once she stopped, as though arrested by a
physical barrier; and with a moan sank down in a helpless heap on the
cool moss.


Harold went from the grove as one seems to move in a dream.  Little
things and big were mixed up in his mind.  He took note, as he went
towards the town by the byroads, of everything around him in his
usual way, for he had always been one of those who notice
unconsciously, or rather unintentionally.  Long afterwards he could
shut his eyes and recall every step of the way from the spot where he
had turned from Stephen to the railway station outside Norcester.
And on many and many such a time when he opened them again the
eyelids were wet.  He wanted to get away quickly, silently,
unobserved.  With the instinct of habitual thought his mind turned
London-ward.  He met but few persons, and those only cottiers.  He
saluted them in his usual cheery way, but did not stop to speak with
any.  He was about to take a single ticket to London when it struck
him that this might look odd, so he asked for a return.  Then, his
mind being once more directed towards concealment of purpose, he sent
a telegram to his housekeeper telling her that he was called away to
London on business.  It was only when he was far on his journey that
he gave thought to ways and means, and took stock of his possessions.
Before he took out his purse and pocket-book he made up his mind that
he would be content with what it was, no matter how little.  He had
left Normanstand and all belonging to it for ever, and was off to
hide himself in whatever part of the world would afford him the best
opportunity.  Life was over!  There was nothing to look forward to;
nothing to look back at!  The present was a living pain whose
lightest element was despair.  As, however, he got further and
further away, his practical mind began to work; he thought over
matters so as to arrange in his mind how best he could dispose of his
affairs, so to cause as little comment as might be, and to save the
possibility of worry or distress of any kind to Stephen.

Even then, in his agony of mind, his heart was with her; it was not
the least among his troubles that he would have to be away from her
when perhaps she would need him most.  And yet whenever he would come
to this point in his endless chain of thought, he would have to stop
for a while, overcome with such pain that his power of thinking was
paralysed.  He would never, could never, be of service to her again.
He had gone out of her life, as she had gone out of his life; though
she never had, nor never could out of his thoughts.  It was all over!
All the years of sweetness, of hope, and trust, and satisfied and
justified faith in each other, had been wiped out by that last
terrible, cruel meeting.  Oh! how could she have said such things to
him!  How could she have thought them!  And there she was now in all
the agony of her unrestrained passion.  Well he knew, from his long
experience of her nature, how she must have suffered to be in such a
state of mind, to have so forgotten all the restraint of her teaching
and her life!  Poor, poor Stephen!  Fatherless now as well as
motherless; and friendless as well as fatherless!  No one to calm her
in the height of her wild abnormal passion!  No one to comfort her
when the fit had passed!  No one to sympathise with her for all that
she had suffered!  No one to help her to build new and better hopes
out of the wreck of her mad ideas!  He would cheerfully have given
his life for her.  Only last night he was prepared to kill, which was
worse than to die, for her sake.  And now to be far away, unable to
help, unable even to know how she fared.  And behind her eternally
the shadow of that worthless man who had spurned her love and flouted
her to a chance comer in his drunken delirium.  It was too bitter to
bear.  How could God lightly lay such a burden on his shoulders who
had all his life tried to walk in sobriety and chastity and in all
worthy and manly ways!  It was unfair!  It was unfair!  If he could
do anything for her?  Anything!  Anything! . . . And so the unending
whirl of thoughts went on!

The smoke of London was dim on the horizon when he began to get back
to practical matters.  When the train drew up at Euston he stepped
from it as one to whom death would be a joyous relief!

He went to a quiet hotel, and from there transacted by letter such
business matters as were necessary to save pain and trouble to
others.  As for himself, he made up his mind that he would go to
Alaska, which he took to be one of the best places in the as yet
uncivilised world for a man to lose his identity.  As a security at
the start he changed his name; and as John Robinson, which was not a
name to attract public attention, he shipped as a passenger on the
Scoriac from London to New York.

The Scoriac was one of the great cargo boats which take a certain
number of passengers.  The few necessaries which he took with him
were chosen with an eye to utility in that frozen land which he
sought.  For the rest, he knew nothing, nor did he care how or
whither he went.  His vague purpose was to cross the American
Continent to San Francisco, and there to take passage for the high
latitudes north of the Yukon River.


When Stephen began to regain consciousness her first sensation was
one of numbness.  She was cold in the back, and her feet did not seem
to exist; but her head was hot and pulsating as though her brain were
a living thing.  Then her half-open eyes began to take in her
surroundings.  For another long spell she began to wonder why all
around her was green.  Then came the inevitable process of reason.
Trees!  It is a wood!  How did I come here? why am I lying on the
ground?

All at once wakened memory opened on her its flood-gates, and
overwhelmed her with pain.  With her hands pressed to her throbbing
temples and her burning face close to the ground, she began to recall
what she could of the immediate past.  It all seemed like a terrible
dream.  By degrees her intelligence came back to its normal strength,
and all at once, as does one suddenly wakened from sleep to the
knowledge of danger, she sat up.

Somehow the sense of time elapsed made Stephen look at her watch.  It
was half-past twelve.  As she had come into the grove immediately
after breakfast, and as Harold had almost immediately joined her, and
as the interview between them had been but short, she must have lain
on the ground for more than three hours.  She rose at once, trembling
in every limb.  A new fear began to assail her; that she had been
missed at home, and that some one might have come to look for her.
Up to now she had not been able to feel the full measure of pain
regarding what had passed, but which would, she knew, come to her in
the end.  It was too vague as yet; she could not realise that it had
really been.  But the fear of discovery was immediate, and must be
guarded against without delay.  As well as she could, she tidied
herself and began to walk slowly back to the house, hoping to gain
her own room unnoticed.  That her general intelligence was awake was
shown by the fact that before she left the grove she remembered that
she had forgotten her sunshade.  She went back and searched till she
had found it.

Gaining her room without meeting any one, she at once change her
dress, fearing that some soil or wrinkle might betray her.
Resolutely she put back from her mind all consideration of the past;
there would be time for that later on.  Her nerves were already much
quieter than they had been.  That long faint, or lapse into
insensibility, had for the time taken the place of sleep.  There
would be a price to be paid for it later; but for the present it had
served its purpose.  Now and again she was disturbed by one thought;
she could not quite remember what had occurred after Harold had left,
and just before she became unconscious.  She dared not dwell upon it,
however.  It would doubtless all come back to her when she had
leisure to think the whole matter over as a connected narrative.

When the gong sounded for lunch she went down, with a calm exterior,
to face the dreaded ordeal of another meal.

Luncheon passed off without a hitch.  She and her aunt talked as
usual over all the small affairs of the house and the neighbourhood,
and the calm restraint was in itself soothing.  Even then she could
not help feeling how much convention is to a woman's life.  Had it
not been for these recurring trials of set hours and duties she could
never have passed the last day and night without discovery of her
condition of mind.  That one terrible, hysterical outburst was
perhaps the safety valve.  Had it been spread over the time occupied
in conventional duties its force even then might have betrayed her;
but without the necessity of nerving herself to conventional needs,
she would have infallibly betrayed herself by her negative condition.

After lunch she went to her own boudoir where, when she had shut the
inner door, no one was allowed to disturb her without some special
need in the house or on the arrival of visitors.  This 'sporting oak'
was the sign of 'not at home' which she had learned in her glimpse of
college life.  Here in the solitude of safety, she began to go over
the past, resolutely and systematically.

She had already been so often over the memory of the previous
humiliating and unhappy day that she need not revert to it at
present.  Since then had she not quarrelled with Harold, whom she had
all her life so trusted that her quarrel with him seemed to shake the
very foundations of her existence?  As yet she had not remembered
perfectly all that had gone on under the shadow of the beech grove.
She dared not face it all at once, even as yet.  Time must elapse
before she should dare to cry; to think of her loss of Harold was to
risk breaking down altogether.  Already she felt weak.  The strain of
the last forty-eight hours was too much for her physical strength.
She began to feel, as she lay back in her cushioned chair, that a
swoon is no worthy substitute for sleep.  Indeed it had seemed to
make the need for sleep even more imperative.

It was all too humiliating!  She wanted to think over what had been;
to recall it as far as possible so as to fix it in her mind, whilst
it was still fresh.  Later on, some action might have to be based on
her recollection.  And yet . . . How could she think when she was so
tired . . . tired . . .

Nature came to the poor girl's relief at last, and she fell into a
heavy sleep . . .

It was like coming out of the grave to be dragged back to waking life
out of such a sleep, and so soon after it had begun.  But the voice
seemed to reach to her inner consciousness in some compelling way.
For a second she could not understand; but as she rose from the
cushions the maid's message repeated, brought her wide awake and
alert in an instant:

'Mr. Everard, young Mr. Everard, to see you, miss!'



CHAPTER XVI--A PRIVATE CONVERSATION



The name braced Stephen at once.  Here was danger, an enemy to be
encountered; all the fighting blood of generations leaped to the
occasion.  The short spell of sleep had helped to restore her.  There
remained still quite enough of mental and nervous excitement to make
her think quickly; the words were hardly out of the maid's mouth
before her resolution was taken.  It would never do to let Leonard
Everard see she was diffident about meeting him; she would go down at
once.  But she would take the precaution of having her aunt present;
at any rate, till she should have seen how the land lay.  Her being
just waked from sleep would be an excuse for asking her aunt to see
the visitor till she came down.  So she said to the maid:

'I have been asleep.  I must have got tired walking in the wood in
the heat.  Ask Auntie to kindly see Mr. Everard in the blue drawing-
room till I come down.  I must tidy my hair; but I will be down in a
few minutes.'

'Shall I send Marjorie to you, miss?'

'No!  Don't mind; I can do what I want myself.  Hurry down to Miss
Rowly!'

How she regarded Leonard Everard now was shown in her instinctive
classing him amongst her enemies.

When she entered the room she seemed all aglow.  She wanted not only
to overcome but to punish; and all the woman in her had risen to the
effort.  Never in her life had Stephen Norman looked more radiantly
beautiful, more adorable, more desirable.  Even Leonard Everard felt
his pulses quicken as he saw that glowing mass of beauty standing out
against the cold background of old French tapestry.  All the physical
side of him leaped in answer to the call of her beauty; and even his
cold heart and his self-engrossed brain followed with slower gait.
He had been sitting opposite Miss Rowly in one of the windows,
twirling his hat in nervous suspense.  He jumped up, and, as she came
towards him, went forward rapidly to greet her.  No one could mistake
the admiration in his eyes.  Ever since he had made up his mind to
marry her she had assumed a new aspect in his thoughts.  But now her
presence swept away all false imaginings; from the moment that her
loveliness dawned upon him something like love began to grow within
his breast.  Stephen saw the look and it strengthened her.  He had so
grievously wounded her pride the previous day that her victory on
this was a compensation which set her more at her old poise.

Her greeting was all sweetness:  she was charmed to see him.  How was
his father, and what was the news?  Miss Rowly looked on with smiling
visage.  She too had seen the look of admiration in his eyes, and it
pleased her.  Old ladies, especially when they are maiden ladies,
always like to see admiration in the eyes of young men when they are
turned in the direction of any girl dear to them.

They talked for some time, keeping all the while, by Stephen's clever
generalship, to the small-talk of the neighbourhood and the minor
events of social importance.  As the time wore on she could see that
Leonard was growing impatient, and evidently wanted to see her alone.
She ignored, however, all his little private signalling, and
presently ordered tea to be brought.  This took some little time;
when it had been brought and served and drunk, Leonard was in a
smothered fume of impatience.  She was glad to see that as yet her
aunt had noticed nothing, and she still hoped that she would be able
to so prolong matters, that she would escape without a private
interview.  She did not know the cause of Leonard's impatience:  that
he must see her before the day passed.  She too was an egoist, in her
own way; in the flush of belief of his subjugation she did not think
of attributing to him any other motive than his desire for herself.
As she had made up her mind on the final issue she did not want to be
troubled by a new 'scene.'

But, after all, Leonard was a man; and man's ways are more direct
than woman's.  Seeing that he could not achieve his object in any
other way, he said out suddenly, thinking, and rightly, that she
would not wish to force an issue in the presence of her aunt:

'By the way, Miss Norman,' he had always called her 'Miss Norman' in
her aunt's presence:  'I want to have two minutes with you before I
go.  On a matter of business,' he added, noticing Miss Rowly's
surprised look.  The old lady was old-fashioned even for her age; in
her time no young man would have asked to see a young lady alone on
business.  Except on one kind of business; and with regard to that
kind of business gentlemen had to obtain first the confidence and
permission of guardians.  Leonard saw the difficulty and said
quickly:

'It is on the matter you wrote to me about!'

Stephen was prepared for a nasty shock, but hardly for so nasty a one
as this.  There was an indelicacy about it which went far beyond the
bounds of thoughtless conventionality.  That such an appeal should be
made to her, and in such a way, savoured of danger.  Her woman's
intuition gave her the guard, and at once she spoke, smilingly and
gently as one recalling a matter in which the concern is not her own:

'Of course!  It was selfish of me not to have thought of it, and to
have kept you so long waiting.  The fact is, Auntie, that Leonard--I
like to call him Leonard, since we were children together, and he is
so young; though perhaps it would be more decorous nowadays to say
""Mr. Everard""--has consulted me about his debts.  You know, Auntie
dear, that young men will be young men in such matters; or perhaps
you do not, since the only person who ever worried you has been
myself.  But I stayed at Oxford and I know something of young men's
ways; and as I am necessarily more or less of a man of business, he
values my help.  Don't you, Leonard?'  The challenge was so direct,
and the position he was in so daringly put, that he had to acquiesce.
Miss Rowly, who had looked on with a frown of displeasure, said
coldly:

'I know you are your own mistress, my dear.  But surely it would be
better if Mr. Everard would consult with his solicitor or his
father's agent, or some of his gentlemen friends, rather than with a
young lady whose relations with him, after all, are only those of a
neighbour on visiting terms.  For my own part, I should have thought
that Mr. Everard's best course would have been to consult his own
father!  But the things that gentlemen, as well as ladies do, have
been sadly changed since my time!'  Then, rising in formal dignity,
she bowed gravely to the visitor before leaving the room.

But the position of being left alone in the room with Leonard did not
at all suit Stephen's plans.  Rising quickly she said to her aunt:

'Don't stir, Auntie.  I dare say you are right in what you say; but I
promised Mr. Everard to go into the matter.  And as I have brought
the awkwardness on myself, I suppose I must bear it.  If Mr. Everard
wants to see me alone, and I suppose he is diffident in speaking on
such a matter before you--he didn't play with you, you know!--we can
go out on the lawn.  We shan't be long!'  Before Leonard could
recover his wits she had headed him out on the lawn.

Her strategy was again thoroughly good.  The spot she chose, though
beyond earshot, was quite in the open and commanded by all the
windows in that side of the house.  A person speaking there might say
what he liked, but his actions must be discreet.

On the lawn Stephen tripped ahead; Leonard followed inwardly raging.
By her clever use of the opening she had put him in a difficulty from
which there was no immediate means of extrication.  He could not
quarrel overtly with Stephen; if he did so, how could he enter on the
pressing matter of his debts?  He dared not openly proclaim his
object in wishing to marry her, for had he done so her aunt might
have interfered, with what success he could not be sure.  In any case
it would cause delay, and delay was what he could not afford.  He
felt that in mentioning his debts at just such a movement he had
given Stephen the chance she had so aptly taken.  He had to be on his
good behaviour, however; and with an apprehension that was new to him
he followed her.

An old Roman marble seat was placed at an angle from the house so
that the one of the two occupants within its curve must almost face
the house, whilst the other gave to it at least a quarter-face.
Stephen seated herself on the near side, leaving to Leonard the
exposed position.  As soon as he was seated, she began:

'Now, Leonard, tell me all about the debts?'  She spoke in tones of
gay friendliness, but behind the mask of her cheerfulness was the
real face of fear.  Down deep in her mind was a conviction that her
letter was a pivotal point of future sorrow.  It was in the meantime
quite apparent to her that Leonard kept it as his last resource; so
her instinct was to keep it to the front and thus minimise its power.

Leonard, though inwardly weakened by qualms of growing doubt, had the
animal instinct that, as he was in opposition, his safety was in
attacking where his opponent most feared.  He felt that there was
some subtle change in his companion; this was never the same Stephen
Norman whom only yesterday he had met upon the hill!  He plunged at
once into his purpose.

'But it wasn't about my debts you asked me to meet you, Stephen.'

'You surprise me, Leonard!  I thought I simply asked you to come to
meet me.  I know the first subject I mentioned when we began to talk,
after your grumbling about coming in the heat, was your money
matters.'  Leonard winced, but went on:

'It was very good of you, Stephen; but really that is not what I came
to speak of to-day.  At first, at all events!' he added with a
sublime naivette, as the subject of his debts and his imperative want
of money rose before him.  Stephen's eyes flashed; she saw more
clearly than ever through his purpose.  Such as admission at the very
outset of the proffer of marriage, which she felt was coming, was
little short of monstrous.  Her companion did not see the look of
mastery on her face; he was looking down at the moment.  A true lover
would have been looking up.

'I wanted to tell you, Stephen, that I have been thinking over what
you said to me in your letter, and what you said in words; and I want
to accept!'  As he was speaking he was looking her straight in the
face.

Stephen answered slowly with a puzzled smile which wrinkled up her
forehead:

'Accept what I said in my letter! why, Leonard, what do you mean?
That letter must have had a lot more in it than I thought.  I seem to
remember that it was simply a line asking you to meet me.  Just let
me look at it; I should like to be sure of what actually is!'  As she
spoke she held out her hand.  Leonard was nonplussed; he did not know
what to say.  Stephen made up her mind to have the letter back.
Leonard was chafing under the position forced upon him, and tried to
divert his companion from her purpose.  He knew well why she had
chosen that exposed position for their interview.  Now, as her
outstretched hand embarrassed him, he made reprisal; he tried to take
it in his in a tender manner.

She instantly drew back her hand and put it behind her in a decided
manner.  She was determined that whatever might happen she would not
let any watcher at the windows, by chance or otherwise, see any sign
of tenderness on her part.  Leonard, thinking that his purpose had
been effected, went on, breathing more freely:

'Your letter wasn't much.  Except of course that it gave me the
opportunity of listening to what you said; to all your sweet words.
To your more than sweet proposal!'

'Yes!  It must have been sweet to have any one, who was in a position
to do so, offer to help you when you knew that you were overwhelmed
with debts!'  The words were brutal.  Stephen felt so; but she had no
alternative.  Leonard had some of the hard side of human nature; but
he had also some of the weak side.  He went on blindly:

'I have been thinking ever since of what you said, and I want to tell
you that I would like to do as you wish!'  As he spoke, his words
seemed even to him to be out of place.  He felt it would be necessary
to throw more fervour into the proceedings.  The sudden outburst
which followed actually amused Stephen, even in her state of fear:

'Oh, Stephen, don't you know that I love you!  You are so beautiful!
I love you!  I love you!  Won't you be my wife?'

This was getting too much to close quarters.  Stephen said in a calm,
business-like way:

'My dear Leonard, one thing at a time!  I came out here, you know, to
speak of your debts; and until that is done, I really won't go into
any other matter.  Of course if you'd rather not . . . '  Leonard
really could not afford this; matters were too pressing with him.  So
he tried to affect a cheery manner; but in his heart was a black
resolve that she should yet pay for this.

'All right! Stephen.  Whatever you wish I will do; you are the queen
of my heart, you know!'

'How much is the total amount?' said Stephen.

This was a change to the prosaic which made sentiment impossible.  He
gave over, for the time.

'Go on!' said Stephen, following up her advantage.  'Don't you even
know how much you owe?'

'The fact is, I don't.  Not exactly.  I shall make up the amount as
well as I can and let you know.  But that's not what I came about to-
day.'  Stephen was going to make an angry gesture of dissent.  She
was not going to have that matter opened up.  She waited, however,
for Leonard was going on after his momentary pause.  She breathed
more freely after his first sentence.  He was unable evidently to
carry on a double train of thought.

'It was about that infernal money-lenders' letter that the Governor
got!'  Stephen got still less anxious.  This open acknowledgment of
his true purpose seemed to clear the air.

'What is the amount?'  Leonard looked quickly at her; the relief of
her mind made her tone seem joyful.

'A monkey!  Five hundred pounds, you know.  But then there's three
hundred for interest that has to be paid also.  It's an awful lot of
money, isn't it?'  The last phrase was added on seeing Stephen's
surprised look.

'Yes!' she answered quietly.  'A great deal of money--to waste!'
They were both silent for a while.  Then she said:

'What does your father say to it?'

'He was in an awful wax.  One of these beastly duns had written to
him about another account and he was in a regular fury.  When I told
him I would pay it within a week, he said very little, which was
suspicious; and then, just when I was going out, he sprung this on
me.  Mean of him! wasn't it?  I need expect no help from him.'  As he
was speaking he took a mass of letters from his pocket and began to
look among them for the money-lenders' letter.

'Why, what a correspondence you have there.  Do you keep all your
letters in your pockets?' said Stephen quietly.

'All I don't tear up or burn.  It wouldn't do to let the Governor
into my secrets.  He might know too much!'

'And are all those letters from duns?'

'Mostly, but I only keep those letters I have to attend to and those
I care for.'

'Show me the bundle!' she said.  Then seeing him hesitate, added:

'You know if I am to help you to get clear you must take me into your
confidence.  I dare say I shall have to see a lot more letters than
these before you are quite clear!'  Her tone was too quiet.  Knowing
already the silent antagonism between them he began to suspect her;
knowing also that her own letter was not amongst them, he used his
wits and handed them over without a word.  She, too, suspected him.
After his tacit refusal to give her the letter, she almost took it
for granted that it was not amongst them.  She gave no evidence of
her feeling, however, but opened and read the letters in due
sequence; all save two, which, being in a female hand, she gave back
without a word.  There was a calmness and an utter absence of
concern, much less of jealousy, about this which disconcerted him.
Throughout her reading Stephen's face showed surprise now and again;
but when she came to the last, which was that of the usurers, it
showed alarm.  Being a woman, a legal threat had certain fears of its
own.

'There must be no delay about this!' she said.

'What am I to do?' he answered, a weight off his mind that the fiscal
matter had been practically entered on.

'I shall see that you get the money!' she said quietly.  'It will be
really a gift, but I prefer it to be as a loan for many reasons.'
Leonard made no comment.   He found so many reasons in his own mind
that he thought it wise to forbear from asking any of hers.  Then she
took the practical matter in hand:

'You must wire to these people at once to say that you will pay the
amount on the day after to-morrow.  If you will come here to-morrow
at four o'clock the money will be ready for you.  You can go up to
town by the evening train and pay off the debt first thing in the
morning.  When you bring the receipt I shall speak to you about the
other debts; but you must make out a full list of them.  We can't
have any half-measure.  I will not go into the matter till I have all
the details before me!'  Then she stood up to go.

As they walked across the lawn, she said:

'By the way, don't forget to bring that letter with you.  I want to
see what I really did say in it!'  Her tone was quiet enough, and the
wording was a request; but Leonard knew as well as if it had been
spoken outright as a threat that if he did not have the letter with
him when he came things were likely to be unpleasant.

The farther he got from Normanstand on his way home the more
discontented Leonard grew.  Whilst he had been in Stephen's presence
she had so dominated him, not only by her personality but by her use
of her knowledge of his own circumstances, that he had not dared to
make protest or opposition; but now he began to feel how much less he
was to receive than he had expected.  He had come prepared to allow
Stephen to fall into his arms, fortune and all.  But now, although he
had practical assurance that the weight of his debts would be taken
from him, he was going away with his tail between his legs.  He had
not even been accepted as a suitor, he who had himself been wooed
only a day before.  His proposal of marriage had not been accepted,
had not even been considered by the woman who had so lately broken
ironclad convention to propose marriage to him.  He had been treated
merely as a scapegrace debtor who had come to ask favours from an old
friend.  He had even been treated like a bad boy; had been told that
he had wasted money; had been ordered, in no doubtful way, to bring
the full schedule of his debts.  And all the time he dared not say
anything lest the thing shouldn't come off at all.  Stephen had such
an infernally masterly way with her!  It didn't matter whether she
was proposing to him, or he was proposing to her, he was made to feel
small all the same.  He would have to put up with it till he had got
rid of the debts!

And then as to the letter.  Why was she so persistent about seeing
it?  Did she want to get it into her hands and then keep it, as
Harold An Wolf had done?  Was it possible that she suspected he would
use it to coerce her; she would call it 'blackmail,' he supposed.
This being the very thing he had intended to do, and had done, he
grew very indignant at the very thought of being accused of it.  It
was, he felt, a very awkward thing that he had lost possession of the
letter.  He might need it if Stephen got nasty.  Then Harold might
give it to her, as he had threatened to do.  He thought he would call
round that evening by Harold's house, and see if he couldn't get back
the letter.  It belonged to him; Harold had no right to keep it.  He
would see him before he and Stephen got putting their heads together.
So, on his way home, he turned his steps at once to Harold's house.

He did not find him in.  The maid who opened the door could give him
no information; all she could say was that Mrs. Dingle the
housekeeper had got a telegram from Master saying that he had been
called suddenly away on business.

This was a new source of concern to Leonard.  He suspected a motive
of some sort; though what that motive could be he could not hazard
the wildest guess.  On his way home he called at the post-office and
sent a telegram to Cavendish and Cecil, the name of the usurers'
firm, in accordance with Stephen's direction.  He signed it:  'Jasper
Everard.'



CHAPTER XVII--A BUSINESS TRANSACTION



When Stephen had sent off her letter to the bank she went out for a
stroll; she knew it would be no use trying to get rest before dinner.
That ordeal, too, had to be gone through.  She found herself
unconsciously going in the direction of the grove; but when she
became aware of it a great revulsion overcame her, and she shuddered.

Slowly she took her way across the hard stretch of finely-kept grass
which lay on the side of the house away from the wood.  The green
sward lay like a sea, dotted with huge trees, singly, or in clumps as
islands.  In its far-stretching stateliness there was something
soothing.  She came back to the sound of the dressing-gong with a
better strength to resist the trial before her.  Well she knew her
aunt would have something to say on the subject of her interference
in Leonard Everard's affairs.

Her fears were justified, for when they had come into the drawing-
room after dinner Miss Rowly began:

'Stephen dear, is it not unwise of you to interfere in Mr. Everard's
affairs?'

'Why unwise, Auntie?'

'Well, my dear, the world is censorious.  And when a young lady, of
your position and your wealth, takes a part in a young man's affairs
tongues are apt to wag.  And also, dear, debts, young men's debts,
are hardly the subjects for a girl's investigation.  Remember, that
we ladies live very different lives from men; from some men, I should
say, for your dear father was the best of men, and I should think
that in all his life there was nothing which he would have wished
concealed.  But, my dear, young men are less restrained in their ways
than we are, than we have to be for our own safety and protection.'
The poor lady was greatly perturbed at having to speak in such a way.
Stephen saw her distress; coming over to her, she sat down and took
her hand.  Stephen had a very tender side to her nature, and she
loved very truly the dear old lady who had taken her mother's place
and had shown her all a mother's love.  Now, in her loneliness and
woe and fear, she clung to her in spirit.  She would have liked to
have clung to her physically; to have laid her head on her bosom, and
have cried her heart out.  The time for tears had not come.  Hourly
she felt more and more the weight that a shameful secret is to carry.
She knew, however, that she could set her aunt's mind at rest on the
present subject; so she said:

'I think you are right, Auntie dear.  It would have been better if I
had asked you first; but I saw that Leonard was in distress, and
wormed the cause of it from him.  When I heard that it was only debt
I offered to help him.  He is an old friend, you know, Auntie.  We
were children together; and as I have much more money than I can ever
want or spend, I thought I might help him.  I am afraid I have let
myself in for a bigger thing than I intended; but as I have promised
I must go on with it.  I dare say, Auntie, that you are afraid that I
may end by getting in love with him, and marrying him.  Don't you,
dear?'  This was said with a hug and a kiss which gave the old lady
delight.  Her instinct told her what was coming.  She nodded her head
in acquiescence.  Stephen went on gravely:

'Put any such fear out of your mind.  I shall never marry him.  I can
never love him.'  She was going to say 'could never love him,' when
she remembered.

'Are you sure, my dear?  The heart is not always under one's own
control.'

'Quite sure, Auntie.  I know Leonard Everard; and though I have
always liked him, I do not respect him.  Why, the very fact of his
coming to me for money would make me reconsider any view I had
formed, had nothing else ever done so.  You may take it, Auntie dear,
that in the way you mean Leonard is nothing to me; can never be
anything to me!'  Here a sudden inspiration took her.  In its light a
serious difficulty passed, and the doing of a thing which had a fear
of its own became easy.  With a conviction in her tone, which in
itself aided her immediate purpose, she said:

'I shall prove it to you.  That is, if you will not mind doing
something which will save me an embarrassment.'

'You know I will do anything, my dearest, which an old woman can do
for a young one!'  Stephen squeezed the mittened hand which she held
as she went on:

'As I said, I have promised to lend him some money.  The first
instalment is to be given him to-morrow; he is to call for it in the
afternoon.  Will you give it to him for me?'

'Gladly, my dear,' said the old lady, much relieved.  Stephen
continued:

'One other thing, Auntie, I want you to do for me:  not to think of
the amount, or to say a word to me about it.  It is a large sum, and
I dare say it will frighten you a little.  But I have made up my mind
to it.  I am learning a great deal out of this, Auntie dear; and I am
quite willing to pay for my knowledge.  After all, money is the
easiest and cheapest way of paying for knowledge!  Don't you agree
with me?'

Miss Rowly gulped down her disappointment.  She felt that she ought
not to say too much, now that Stephen had set aside her graver fears.
She consoled herself with the thought that even a large amount of
money would cause no inconvenience to so wealthy a woman as Stephen.
Beyond this, as she would have the handing over of the money to
Leonard, she would know the amount.  If advisable, she could
remonstrate.  She could if necessary consult, in confidence, with
Harold.  Her relief from her greater fear, and her gladness at this
new proof of her niece's confidence, were manifested in the extra
affection with which she bade her good-night.

Stephen did not dare to breathe freely till she was quite alone; and
as she lay quiet in her bed in the dark she thought before sleep
came.

Her first feeling was one of thankfulness that immediate danger was
swerving from her.  Things were so shaping themselves that she need
not have any fear concerning Leonard.  For his own sake he would have
to keep silent.  If he intended to blackmail her she would have the
protection of her aunt's knowledge of the loan, and of her
participation in it.  The only weapon that remained to him was her
letter; and that she would get from him before furnishing the money
for the payment of his other debts.

These things out of the way, her thoughts turned to the matter of the
greater dread; that of which all along she had feared to think for a
moment:  Harold!

Harold! and her treatment of him!

The first reception of the idea was positive anguish.  From the
moment he had left her till now there had been no time when a
consideration of the matter was possible.  Time pressed, or
circumstances had interfered, or her own personal condition had
forbidden.  Now, when she was alone, the whole awful truth burst on
her like an avalanche.  Stephen felt the issue of her thinking before
the thinking itself was accomplished; and it was with a smothered
groan that she, in the darkness, held up her arms with fingers linked
in desperate concentration of appeal.

Oh, if she could only take back one hour of her life, well she knew
what that hour would be!  Even that shameful time with Leonard on the
hill-top seemed innocuous beside the degrading remembrance of her
conduct to the noble friend of her whole life.

Sadly she turned over in her bed, and with shut eyes put her burning
face on the pillow, to hide, as it were, from herself her abject
depth of shame.

Leonard lounged through the next morning with what patience he could.
At four o'clock he was at the door of Normanstand in his dogcart.
This time he had a groom with him and a suitcase packed for a night's
use, as he was to go on to London after his interview with Stephen.
He had lost sight altogether of the matter of Stephen's letter, or
else he would have been more nervous.

He was taken into the blue drawing-room, where shortly Miss Rowly
joined him.  He had not expected this.  His mental uneasiness
manifested itself in his manner, and his fidgeting was not unobserved
by the astute old lady.  He was disconcerted; 'overwhelmed' would
better have described his feelings when she said:

'Miss Norman is sorry she can't see you to-day as she is making a
visit; but she has given me a message for you, or rather a commission
to discharge.  Perhaps you had better sit down at the table; there
are writing materials there, and I shall want a receipt of some
sort.'

'Stephen did not say anything about a receipt!'  The other smiled
sweetly as she said in a calm way:

'But unfortunately Miss Norman is not here; and so I have to do the
best I can.  I really must have some proof that I have fulfilled my
trust.  You see, Mr. Everard, though it is what lawyers call a
""friendly"" transaction, it is more or less a business act; and I must
protect myself.'

Leonard saw that he must comply, for time pressed.  He sat down at
the table.  Taking up a pen and drawing a sheet of paper towards him,
he said with what command of his voice he could:

'What am I to write?'  The old lady took from her basket a folded
sheet of notepaper, and, putting on her reading-glasses, said as she
smoothed it out:

'I think it would be well to say something like this--""I, Leonard
Everard, of Brindehow, in the Parish of Normanstand, in the County of
Norcester, hereby acknowledge the receipt from Miss Laetitia Rowly of
nine hundred pounds sterling lent to me in accordance with my
request, the same being to clear me of a pressing debt due by me.'

When he had finished writing the receipt Miss Rowly looked it over,
and handing it back to him, said:

'Now sign; and date!'  He did so with suppressed anger.

She folded the document carefully and put it in her pocket.  Then
taking from the little pouch which she wore at her belt a roll of
notes, she counted out on the table nine notes of one hundred pounds
each.  As she put down the last she said:

'Miss Norman asked me to say that a hundred pounds is added to the
sum you specified to her, as doubtless the usurers would, since you
are actually behind the time promised for repayment, require
something extra as a solatium or to avoid legal proceedings already
undertaken.  In fact that they would ""put more salt on your tail.""
The expression, I regret to say, is not mine.'

Leonard folded up the notes, put them into his pocket-book, and
walked away.  He did not feel like adding verbal thanks to the
document already signed.  As he got near the door the thought struck
him; turning back he said:

'May I ask if Stephen said anything about getting the document?'

'I beg your pardon,' she said icily, 'did you speak of any one?'

'Miss Norman, I meant!'  Miss Rowly's answer to this came so smartly
that it left an added sting.  Her arrow was fledged with two feathers
so that it must shoot true:  her distrust of him and his own
impotence.

'Oh no!  Miss Norman knows nothing of this.  She simply asked me to
give you the money.  This is my own doing entirely.  You see, I must
exercise my judgment on my dear niece's behalf.  Of course it may not
be necessary to show her the receipt; but if it should ever be
advisable it is always there.'

He looked at her with anger, not unmixed with admiration, as, bowing
rather lower than necessary, he went out of the door, saying sotto
voce, between his teeth:

'When my turn comes out you go!  Neck and crop!  Quick!  Normanstand
isn't big enough to hold us both!'



CHAPTER XVIII--MORE BUSINESS



When Leonard tendered the eight hundred pounds in payment of his debt
of five hundred, Mr. Cavendish at first refused to take it.  But when
Leonard calmly but firmly refused to pay a single penny beyond the
obligations already incurred, including interest on the full sum for
one day, he acquiesced.  He knew the type of man fully; and knew also
that in all probability it would not be long before he would come to
the Firm again on a borrowing errand.  When such time should come, he
would put an extra clause into his Memorandum of Agreement which
would allow the Firm full power to make whatever extra charge they
might choose in case of the slightest default in making payment.

Leonard's visits to town had not of late been many, and such as he
had had were not accompanied with a plethora of cash.  He now felt
that he had earned a holiday; and it was not till the third morning
that he returned to Brindehow.  His father made no comment on his
absence; his only allusion to the subject was:

'Back all right!  Any news in town?'  There was, however, an unwonted
suavity in his manner which made Leonard a little anxious.  He busied
himself for the balance of the morning in getting together all his
unpaid accounts and making a schedule of them.  The total at first
amazed almost as much as it frightened him.  He feared what Stephen
would say.  She had already commented unfavourably on the one amount
she had seen.  When she was face to face with this she might refuse
to pay altogether.  It would therefore be wise to propitiate her.
What could he do in this direction?  His thoughts naturally turned to
the missing letter.  If he could get possession of it, it would
either serve as a sop or a threat.  In the one case she would be so
glad to have it back that she would not stick at a few pounds; in the
other it would 'bring her to her senses' as he put in his own mind
his intention of blackmail.

He was getting so tightened up in situation that as yet he could only
do as he was told, and keep his temper as well as he could.

Altogether it was in a chastened mood that he made his appearance at
Normanstand later in the afternoon.  He was evidently expected, for
he was shown into the study without a word.  Here Miss Rowly and
Stephen joined him.  Both were very kind in manner.  After the usual
greetings and commonplaces Stephen said in a brisk, businesslike way:

'Have you the papers with you?'  He took the bundle of accounts from
his pocket and handed them to her.  After his previous experience he
would have suggested, had he dared, that he should see Stephen alone;
but he feared the old lady.  He therefore merely said:

'I am afraid you will find the amount very large.  But I have put
down everything!'

So he had; and more than everything.  At the last an idea struck him
that as he was getting so much he might as well have a little more.
He therefore added several good-sized amounts which he called 'debts
of honour.'  This would, he thought, appeal to the feminine mind.
Stephen did not look at the papers at once.  She stood up, holding
them, and said to Miss Rowly:

'Now, if you will talk to Mr. Everard I will go over these documents
quietly by myself.  When I have been through them and understand them
all I shall come back; and we will see what can be done.'  She moved
gracefully out of the room, closing the door behind her.  As is usual
with women, she had more than one motive for her action in going
away.  In the first place, she wished to be alone whilst she went
over the schedule of the debts.  She feared she might get angry; and
in the present state of her mind towards Leonard the expression of
any feeling, even contempt, would not be wise.  Her best protection
from him would be a manifest kindly negation of any special interest.
In the second place, she believed that he would have her letter with
the other papers, and she did not wish her aunt to see it, lest she
should recognise the writing.  In her boudoir, with a beating heart,
she untied the string and looked through the papers.

Her letter was not among them.

For a few seconds she stood stock still, thinking.  Then, with a
sigh, she sat down and began to read the list of debts, turning to
the originals now and again for details.  As she went on, her wonder
and disgust grew; and even a sense of fear came into her thoughts.  A
man who could be so wildly reckless and so selfishly unscrupulous was
to be feared.  She knew his father was a comparatively poor man, who
could not possibly meet such a burden.  If he were thus to his
father, what might he be to her if he got a chance.

The thought of what he might have been to her, had he taken the
chance she had given him, never occurred to her.  This possibility
had already reached the historical stage in her mind.

She made a few pencil notes on the list; and went back to the study.
Her mind was made up.

She was quite businesslike and calm, did not manifest the slightest
disapproval, but seemed to simply accept everything as facts.  She
asked Leonard a few questions on subjects regarding which she had
made notes, such as discounts.  Then she held the paper out to him
and without any preliminary remark said:

'Will you please put the names to these?'

'How do you mean?' he asked, flushing.

'The names of the persons to whom these sums marked ""debt of honour""
are due.'  His reply came quickly, and was a little aggressive; he
thought this might be a good time to make a bluff:

'I do not see that that is necessary.  I can settle them when I have
the money.'  Slowly and without either pause or flurry Stephen
replied, looking him straight in the eyes as she handed him the
papers:

'Of course it is not necessary!  Few things in the world really are!
I only wanted to help you out of your troubles; but if you do not
wish me to . . . !'  Leonard interrupted in alarm:

'No! no!  I only spoke of these items.  You see, being ""debts of
honour"" I ought not to give the names.'  Looking with a keen glance
at her set face he saw she was obdurate; and, recognising his defeat,
said as calmly as he could, for he felt raging:

'All right!  Give me the paper!'  Bending over the table he wrote.
When she took the paper, a look half surprised, half indignant,
passed over her face.  Her watchful aunt saw it, and bending over
looked also at the paper.  Then she too smiled bitterly.

Leonard had printed in the names!  The feminine keenness of both
women had made his intention manifest.  He did not wish for the
possibility of his handwriting being recognised.  His punishment came
quickly.  With a dazzling smile Stephen said to him:

'But, Leonard, you have forgotten to put the addresses!'

'Is that necessary?'

'Of course it is!  Why, you silly, how is the money to be paid if
there are no addresses?'

Leonard felt like a rat in a trap; but he had no alternative.  So
irritated was he, and so anxious to hide his irritation that,
forgetting his own caution, he wrote, not in printing characters but
in his own handwriting, addresses evolved from his own imagination.
Stephen's eyes twinkled as he handed her the paper:  he had given
himself away all round.

Leonard having done all that as yet had been required of him, felt
that he might now ask a further favour, so he said:

'There is one of those bills which I have promised to pay by Monday.'

'Promised?' said Stephen with wide-opened eyes.  She had no idea of
sparing him, she remembered the printed names.  'Why, Leonard, I
thought you said you were unable to pay any of those debts?'

Again he had put himself in a false position.  He could not say that
it was to his father he had made the promise; for he had already told
Stephen that he had been afraid to tell him of his debts.  In his
desperation, for Miss Rowly's remorseless glasses were full on him,
he said:

'I thought I was justified in making the promise after what you said
about the pleasure it would be to help me.  You remember, that day on
the hilltop?'

If he had wished to disconcert her he was mistaken; she had already
thought over and over again of every form of embarrassment her
unhappy action might bring on her at his hands.  She now said sweetly
and calmly, so sweetly and so calmly that he, with knowledge of her
secret, was alarmed:

'But that was not a promise to pay.  If you will remember it was only
an offer, which is a very different thing.  You did not accept it
then!'  She was herself somewhat desperate, or she would not have
sailed so close to the wind.

'Ah, but I accepted later!' he said quickly, feeling in his
satisfaction in an epigrammatic answer a certain measure of victory.
He felt his mistake when she went on calmly:

'Offers like that are not repeated.  They are but phantoms, after
all.  They come at their own choice, when they do come; and they stay
but the measure of a breath or two.  You cannot summon them!'
Leonard fell into the current of the metaphor and answered:

'I don't know that even that is impossible.  There are spells which
call, and recall, even phantoms!'

'Indeed!'  Stephen was anxious to find his purpose.

Leonard felt that he was getting on, that he was again acquiring the
upper hand; so he pushed on the metaphor, more and more satisfied
with himself:

'And it is wonderful how simple some spells, and these the most
powerful, can be.  A remembered phrase, the recollection of a
pleasant meeting, the smell of a forgotten flower, or the sight of a
forgotten letter; any or all of these can, through memory, bring back
the past.  And it is often in the past that the secret of the future
lies!'

Miss Rowly felt that something was going on before her which she
could not understand.  Anything of this man's saying which she could
not fathom must be at least dangerous; so she determined to spoil his
purpose, whatever it might be.

'Dear me!  That is charmingly poetic!  Past and future; memory and
the smell of flowers; meetings and letters!  It is quite philosophy.
Do explain it all, Mr. Everard!'  Leonard was not prepared to go on
under the circumstances.  His own mention of 'letter,' although he
had deliberately used it with the intention of frightening Stephen,
had frightened himself.  It reminded him that he had not brought, had
not got, the letter; and that as yet he was not certain of getting
the money.  Stephen also had noted the word, and determined not to
pass the matter by.  She said gaily:

'If a letter is a spell, I think you have a spell of mine, which is a
spell of my own weaving.  You were to show me the letter in which I
asked you to come to see me.  It was in that, I think you said, that
I mentioned your debts; but I don't remember doing so.  Show it to
me!'

'I have not got it with me!'  This was said with mulish sullenness.

'Why not?'

'I forgot.'

'That is a pity!  It is always a pity to forget things in a business
transaction; as this is.  I think, Auntie, we must wait till we have
all the documents, before we can complete this transaction!'

Leonard was seriously alarmed.  If the matter of the loan were not
gone on with at once the jeweller's bill could not be paid by Monday,
and the result would be another scene with his father.  He turned to
Stephen and said as charmingly as he could, and he was all in earnest
now:

'I'm awfully sorry!  But these debts have been so worrying me that
they put lots of things out of my head.  That bill to be paid on
Monday, when I haven't a feather to fly with, is enough to drive a
fellow off his chump.  The moment I lay my hands on the letter I
shall keep it with me so that I can't forget it again.  Won't you
forgive me for this time?'

'Forgive!' she answered, with a laugh.  'Why it's not worth
forgiveness!  It is not worth a second thought!  All right!  Leonard,
make your mind easy; the bill will be paid on Monday!'  Miss Rowly
said quietly:

'I have to be in London on Monday afternoon; I can pay it for you.'
This was a shock to Leonard; he said impulsively:

'Oh, I say!  Can't I . . . '  His words faded away as the old lady
again raised her lorgnon and gazed at him calmly.  She went on:

'You know, my dear, it won't be even out of my way, as I have to call
at Mr. Malpas's office, and I can go there from the hotel in Regent
Street.'  This was all news to Stephen.  She did not know that her
aunt had intended going to London; and indeed she did not know of any
business with Mr. Malpas, whose firm had been London solicitor to the
Rowlys for several generations.  She had no doubt, however, as to the
old lady's intention.  It was plain to her that she wanted to help.
So she thanked her sweetly.  Leonard could say nothing.  He seemed to
he left completely out of it.  When Stephen rose, as a hint to him
that it was time for him to go, he said humbly, as he left:

'Would it be possible that I should have the receipt before Monday
evening?  I want to show it to my father.'

'Certainly!' said the old lady, answering him.  'I shall be back by
the two o'clock train; and if you happen to be at the railway station
at Norcester when I arrive I can give it to you!'

He went away relieved, but vindictive; determined in his own mind
that when he had received the money for the rest of the debts he
would see Stephen, when the old lady was not present, and have it out
with her.



CHAPTER XIX--A LETTER



On Monday evening after dinner Mr. Everard and his son sat for a
while in silence.  They had not met since morning; and in the
presence of the servants conversation had been scrupulously polite.
Now, though they were both waiting to talk, neither liked to begin.
The older man was outwardly placid, when Leonard, a little flushed
and a little nervous of voice, began:

'Have you had any more bills?'  He had expected none, and thus hoped
to begin by scoring against his father.  It was something of a set-
down when the latter, taking some papers from his breast-pocket,
handed them to him, saying:

'Only these!'  Leonard took them in silence and looked at them.  All
were requests for payment of debts due by his son.

In each case the full bill was enclosed.  He was silent a while; but
his father spoke:

'It would almost seem as if all these people had made up their minds
that you were of no further use to them.'  Then without pausing he
said, but in a sharper voice:

'Have you paid the jewellers?  This is Monday!'  Without speaking
Leonard took leisurely from his pocket folded paper.  This he opened,
and, after deliberately smoothing out the folds, handed it to his
father.  Doubtless something in his manner had already convinced the
latter that the debt was paid.  He took the paper in as leisurely a
way as it had been given, adjusted his spectacles, and read it.
Seeing that his son had scored this time, he covered his chagrin with
an appearance of paternal satisfaction.

'Good!'  For many reasons he was glad the debt was paid He was
himself too poor a man to allow the constant drain his son's debts,
and too careful of his position to be willing have such exposure as
would come with a County Court action against his son.  All the same,
his exasperation continued.  Neither was his quiver yet empty.  He
shot his next arrow:

'I am glad you paid off those usurers!'  Leonard did not like the
definite way he spoke.  Still in silence, he took from his pocket a
second paper, which he handed over unfolded.  Mr. Everard read it,
and returned it politely, with again one word:

'Good!'  For a few minutes there was silence.  The father spoke
again:

'Those other debts, have you paid them?'  With a calm deliberation so
full of tacit rudeness that it made his father flush Leonard
answered:

'Not yet, sir!  But I shall think of them presently.  I don't care to
be bustled by them; and I don't mean to!'  It was apparent that
though he spoke verbally of his creditors, his meaning was with
regard to others also.

'When will they be paid?'  As his son hesitated, he went on:

'I am alluding to those who have written to me.  I take it that as my
estate is not entailed, and as you have no income except from me, the
credit which has been extended to you has been rather on my account
than your own.  Therefore, as the matter touches my own name, I am
entitled to know something of what is going on.'  His manner as well
as his words was so threatening that Leonard was a little afraid.  He
might imperil his inheritance.  He answered quickly:

'Of course, sir, you shall know everything.  After all, you know, my
affairs are your affairs!'

'I know nothing of the sort.  I may of course be annoyed by your
affairs, even dishonoured, in a way, by them.  But I accept no
responsibility whatever.  As you have made your bed, so must you lie
on it!'

'It's all right, sir, I assure you.  All my debts, both those you
know of and some you don't, I shall settle very shortly.'

'How soon?'  The question was sternly put.

'In a few days.  I dare say a week at furthest will see everything
straightened out.'

The elder man stood, saying gravely as he went to the door:

'You will do well to tell me when the last of them is paid.  There is
something which I shall then want to tell you!'  Without waiting for
reply he went to his study.

Leonard went to his room and made a systematic, though unavailing,
search for Stephen's letter; thinking that by some chance he might
have recovered it from Harold and had overlooked it.

The next few days he passed in considerable suspense.  He did not
dare go near Normanstand until he was summoned, as he knew he would
be when he was required.


When Miss Rowly returned from her visit to London she told Stephen
that she had paid the bill at the jeweller's, and had taken the
precaution of getting a receipt, together with a duplicate for Mr.
Everard.  The original was by her own request made out as received
from Miss Laetitia Rowly in settlement of the account of Leonard
Everard, Esq.; the duplicate merely was 'recd. in settlement of the
account of--,' etc.  Stephen's brows bent hit thought as she said:

'Why did you have it done that way, Auntie dear?'  The other answered
quietly:

'I had a reason, my dear; good reason!  Perhaps I shall tell you all
about it some day; in the meantime I want you not to ask me anything
about it.  I have a reason for that too.  Stephen, won't you trust me
in this, blindfold?'  There was something so sweet and loving in the
way she made the request that Stephen was filled with emotion.  She
put her arms round her aunt's neck and hugged her tight.  Then laying
her head on her bosom she said with a sigh:

'Oh, my dear, you can't know how I trust you; or how much your trust
is to me.  You never can know!'

The next day the two women held a long consultation over the schedule
of Leonard's debts.  Neither said a word of disfavour, or even
commented on the magnitude.  The only remark touching on the subject
was made by Miss Rowly:

'We must ask for proper discounts.  Oh, the villainy of those
tradesmen!  I do believe they charge double in the hope of getting
half.  As to jewellers . . . !'  Then she announced her intention of
going up to town again on Thursday, at which visit she would arrange
for the payment of the various debts.  Stephen tried to remonstrate,
but she was obdurate.  She held Stephen's hand in hers and stroked it
lovingly as she kept on repeating:

'Leave it all to me, dear!  Leave it all to me!  Everything shall be
paid as you wish; but leave it to me!'

Stephen acquiesced.  This gentle yielding was new in her; it touched
the elder lady to the quick, even whilst it pained her.  Well she
knew that some trouble must have gone to the smoothing of that
imperious nature.

Stephen's inner life in these last few days was so bitterly sad that
she kept it apart from all the routine of social existence.  Into it
never came now, except as the exciting cause of all the evil, a
thought of Leonard.  The saddening memory was of Harold.  And of him
the sadness was increased and multiplied by a haunting fear.  Since
he had walked out of the grove she had not seen him nor heard from
him.  This was in itself strange; for in all her life, when she was
at home and he too, never a day passed without her seeing him.  She
had heard her aunt say that word had come of his having made a sudden
journey to London, from which he had not yet returned.  She was
afraid to make inquiries.  Partly lest she might hear bad news--this
was her secret fear; partly lest she might bring some attention to
herself in connection with his going.  Of some things in connection
with her conduct to him she was afraid to think at all.  Thought, she
felt, would come in time, and with it new pains and new shames, of
which as yet she dared not think.

One morning came an envelope directed in Harold's hand.  The sight
made her almost faint.  She rejoiced that she had been first down,
and had opened the postbag with her own key.  She took the letter to
her room and shut herself in before opening it.  Within were a few
lines of writing and her own letter to Leonard in its envelope.  Her
head beat so hard that she could scarcely see; but gradually the
writing seemed to grow out of the mist:

'The enclosed should be in your hands.  It is possible that it may
comfort you to know that it is safe.  Whatever may come, God love and
guard you.'

For a moment joy, hot and strong, blazed through her.  The last words
were ringing through her brain.  Then came the cold shock, and the
gloom of fear.  Harold would never have written thus unless he was
going away!  It was a farewell!

For a long time she stood, motionless, holding the letter in her
hand.  Then she said, half aloud:

'Comfort!  Comfort!  There is no more comfort in the world for me!
Never, never again!  Oh, Harold!  Harold!'

She sank on her knees beside her bed, and buried her face in her cold
hands, sobbing in all that saddest and bitterest phase of sorrow
which can be to a woman's heart:  the sorrow that is dry-eyed and
without hope.

Presently the habit of caution which had governed her last days woke
her to action.  She bathed her eyes, smoothed her hair, locked the
letter and its enclosure in the little jewel-safe let into the wall,
and came down to breakfast.

The sense of loss was so strong on her that she forgot herself.
Habit carried her on without will or voluntary effort, and, so
faithfully worked to her good that even the loving eyes of her aunt--
and the eyes of love are keen--had no suspicion that any new event
had come into her life.

Not till she was alone in her room that night did Stephen dare to let
her thoughts run freely.  In the darkness her mind began to work
truly, so truly that she began at the first step of logical process:
to study facts.  And to study them she must question till she found
motive.

Why had Harold sent her the letter?  His own words said that it
should be in her hands.  Then, again, he said it might comfort her to
know the letter was safe.  How could it comfort her?  How did he get
possession of the letter?

There she began to understand; her quick intuition and her old
knowledge of Harold's character and her new knowledge of Leonard's,
helped her to reconstruct causes.  In his interview with her he had
admitted that Leonard had told him much, all.  He would no doubt have
refused to believe him, and Leonard would have shown him, as proof,
her letter asking him to meet her.  He would have seen then, as she
did now, how much the possession of that letter might mean to any
one.

Good God! to 'any one.'  Could it have been so to Harold himself . .
. that he thought to use it as an engine, to force her to meet his
wishes--as Leonard had already tried to do!  The mistrust, founded on
her fear, was not dead yet . . . No! no! no!  Her whole being
resented such a monstrous proposition!  Besides, there was proof.
Thank God! there was proof.  A blackmailer would have stayed close to
her, and would have kept the letter; Harold did neither.  Her
recognition of the truth was shown in her act, when, stretching out
her arms in the darkness, she whispered pleadingly:

'Forgive me, Harold!'

And Harold, far away where the setting sun was lying red on the rim
of the western sea, could not hear her.  But perhaps God did.

As, then, Harold's motive was not of the basest, it must have been of
the noblest.  What would be a man's noblest motive under such
circumstances?  Surely self-sacrifice!

And yet there could be no doubt as to Harold's earnestness when he
had told her that he loved her . . .

Here Stephen covered her face in one moment of rapture.  But the
gloom that followed was darker than the night.  She did not pursue
the thought.  That would come later when she should understand.

And yet, so little do we poor mortals know the verities of things, so
blind are we to things thrust before our eyes, that she understood
more in that moment of ecstasy than in all the reasoning that
preceded and followed it.  But the reasoning went on:

If he really loved, and told her so, wherein was the self-sacrifice?
She had reproached him with coming to her with his suit hotfoot upon
his knowledge of her shameful proffer of herself to another man; of
her refusal by him.  Could he have been so blind as not to have seen,
as she did, the shameful aspect of his impulsive act?  Surely, if he
had thought, he must have seen! . . . And he must have thought; there
had been time for it.  It was at dinner that he had seen Leonard; it
was after breakfast when he had seen her . . . And if he had seen
then . . .

In an instant it all burst upon her; the whole splendid truth.  He
had held back the expression of his long love for her, waiting for
the time when her maturity might enable her to understand truly and
judge wisely; waiting till her grief for the loss of her father had
become a story of the past; waiting for God knows what a man's mind
sees of obstacles when he loves.  But he had spoken it out when it
was to her benefit.  What, then, had been his idea of her benefit?
Was it that he wished to meet the desire that she had manifested to
have some man to--to love? . . . The way she covered her face with
her hands whilst she groaned aloud made her answer to her own query a
perfect negative.

Was it, then, to save her from the evil of marrying Leonard in case
he should repent of his harshness, and later on yield himself to her
wooing?  The fierce movement of her whole body, which almost threw
the clothes from her bed, as the shameful recollection rolled over
her, marked the measure of her self-disdain.

One other alternative there was; but it seemed so remote, so far-
fetched, so noble, so unlike what a woman would do, that she could
only regard it in a shamefaced way.  She put the matter to herself
questioningly, and with a meekness which had its roots deeper than
she knew.  And here out of the depths of her humility came a noble
thought.  A noble thought, which was a noble truth.  Through the
darkness of the night, through the inky gloom of her own soul came
with that thought a ray of truth which, whilst it showed her her own
shrivelled unworthiness, made the man whom she had dishonoured with
insults worse than death stand out in noble relief.  In that instant
she guessed at, and realised, Harold's unselfish nobility of purpose,
the supreme effort of his constant love.  Knowing the humiliation she
must have suffered at Leonard's hands, he had so placed himself that
even her rejection of him might be some solace to her wounded spirit,
her pride.

Here at last was truth!  She knew it in the very marrow of her bones.

This time she did not move.  She thought and thought of that noble
gentleman who had used for her sake even that pent-up passion which,
for her sake also, he had suppressed so long.

In that light, which restored in her eyes and justified so fully the
man whom she had always trusted, her own shame and wrongdoing, and
the perils which surrounded her, were for the time forgotten.

And its glory seemed to rest upon her whilst she slept.



CHAPTER XX--CONFIDENCES



Miss Rowly had received a bulky letter by the morning's post.  She
had not opened it, but had allowed it to rest beside her plate all
breakfast-time.  Then she had taken it away with her to her own
sitting-room.  Stephen did not appear to take any notice of it.  She
knew quite well that it was from some one in London whom her aunt had
asked to pay Leonard's bills.  She also knew that the old lady had
some purpose in her reticence, so she waited.  She was learning to be
patient in these days.  Miss Rowly did say anything about it that
day, or the next, or the next.  The third-morning, she received
another letter which she had read in an enlightening manner.  She
began its perusal with set brow frowning, then she nodded her head
and smiled.  She put the letter back in its envelope and placed it in
the little bag always carried.  But she said nothing.  Stephen
wondered, but waited.

That night, when Stephen's maid had left her, there came a gentle tap
at her door, and an instant after the door opened.  The tap had been
a warning, not a request; it had in a measure prepared Stephen, who
was not surprised to see her Aunt in dressing-gown, though it was
many a long day since she had visited her niece's room at night.  She
closed the door behind her, saying:

'There is something I want to talk to you about, dearest, and I
thought it would be better to do so when there could not be any
possible interruption.  And besides,' here there was a little break
in her voice, 'I could hardly summon up my courage in the daylight.'
She stopped, and the stopping told its own story.  In an instant
Stephen's arm's were round her, all the protective instinct in her
awake, at the distress of the woman she loved.  The old lady took
comfort from the warmth of the embrace, and held her tight whilst she
went on:

'It is about these bills, my dear.  Come and sit down and put a
candle near me.  I want you to read something.'

'Go on, Auntie dear,' she said gravely.  The old lady, after a pause,
spoke with a certain timidity:

'They are all paid; at least all that can be.  Perhaps I had better
read you the letter I have had from my solicitors:

'""Dear Madam,--In accordance with your instructions we have paid all
the accounts mentioned in Schedule A (enclosed).  We have placed for
your convenience three columns:  (1) the original amount of each
account, (2) the amount of discount we were able to arrange, and (3)
the amount paid.  We regret that we have been unable to carry out
your wishes with regard to the items enumerated in Schedule B
(enclosed).  We have, we assure you, done all in our power to find
the gentlemen whose names and addresses are therein given.  These
were marked 'Debt of honour' in the list you handed to us.  Not
having been able to obtain any reply to our letters, we sent one of
our clerks first to the addresses in London, and afterwards to
Oxford.  That clerk, who is well used to such inquiries, could not
find trace of any of the gentlemen, or indeed of their existence.  We
have, therefore, come to the conclusion that, either there must be
some error with regard to (a) names, (b) addresses, or (c) both; or
that no such persons exist.  As it would be very unlikely that such
errors could occur in all the cases, we can only conclude that there
have not been any such persons.  If we may hazard an opinion:  it is
possible that, these debts being what young men call 'debts of
honour,' the debtor, or possibly the creditors, may not have wished
the names mentioned.  In such case fictitious names and addresses may
have been substituted for the real ones.  If you should like any
further inquiry instituted we would suggest that you ascertain the
exact names and addresses from the debtor.  Or should you prefer it
we would see the gentleman on your behalf, on learning from you his
name and address.  We can keep, in the person of either one of the
Firm or a Confidential Clerk as you might prefer, any appointment in
such behalf you may care to make.

'""We have already sent to you the receipted account from each of the
creditors as you directed, viz. 'Received from Miss Laetitia Rowly in
full settlement to date of the account due by Mr. Leonard Everard the
sum of,' etc. etc.  And also, as you further directed, a duplicate
receipt of the sum-total due in each case made out as 'Received in
full settlement to date of account due by,' etc. etc.  The duplicate
receipt was pinned at the back of each account so as to be easily
detachable.

""With regard to finance we have carried out your orders, etc.""'  She
hurried on the reading.  ""These sums, together with the amounts of
nine hundred pounds sterling, and seven hundred pounds sterling
lodged to the account of Miss Stephen Norman in the Norcester branch
of the Bank as repayment of moneys advanced to you as by your written
instructions, have exhausted the sum, etc.""'  She folded up the
letter with the schedules, laying the bundle of accounts on the
table.  Stephen paused; she felt it necessary to collect herself
before speaking.

'Auntie dear, will you let me see that letter?  Oh, my dear, dear
Auntie, don't think I mistrust you that I ask it.  I do because I
love you, and because I want to love you more if it is possible to do
so.'  Miss Rowly handed her the letter.  She rose from the arm of the
chair and stood beside the table as though to get better light from
the candle than she could get from where she had sat.

She read slowly and carefully to the end; then folded up the letter
and handed it to her aunt.  She came back to her seat on the edge of
the chair, and putting her arms round her companion's neck looked her
straight in the eyes.  The elder woman grew embarrassed under the
scrutiny; she coloured up and smiled in a deprecatory way as she
said:

'Don't look at me like that, darling; and don't shake your head so.
It is all right!  I told you I had my reasons, and you said you would
trust me.  I have only done what I thought best!'

'But, Auntie, you have paid away more than half your little fortune.
I know all the figures.  Father and uncle told me everything.  Why
did you do it?  Why did you do it?'  The old woman held out her arms
as she said:

'Come here, dear one, and sit on my knee as you used to when you were
a child, and I will whisper you.'  Stephen sprang from her seat and
almost threw herself into the loving arms.  For a few seconds the
two, clasped tight to each other's heart, rocked gently to and fro.
The elder kissed the younger and was kissed impulsively in return.
Then she stroked the beautiful bright hair with her wrinkled hand,
and said admiringly:

'What lovely hair you have, my dear one!'  Stephen held her closer
and waited.

'Well, my dear, I did it because I love you!'

'I know that, Auntie; you have never done anything else my life!'

'That is true, dear one.  But it is right that I should do this.  Now
you must listen to me, and not speak till I have done.  Keep your
thoughts on my words, so that you may follow my thoughts.  You can do
your own thinking about them afterwards.  And your own talking too; I
shall listen as long as you like!'

'Go on, I'll be good!'

'My dear, it is not right that you should appear to have paid the
debts of a young man who is no relation to you and who will, I know
well, never be any closer to you than he is now.'  She hurried on, as
though fearing an interruption, but Stephen felt that her clasp
tightened.  'We never can tell what will happen as life goes on.
And, as the world is full of scandal, one cannot be too careful not
to give the scandalmongers anything to exercise their wicked spite
upon.  I don't trust that young man! he is a bad one all round, or I
am very much mistaken.  And, my dear, come close to me!  I cannot but
see that you and he have some secret which he is using to distress
you!'  She paused, and her clasp grew closer still as Stephen's head
sank on her breast.  'I know you have done something or said
something foolish of which he has a knowledge.  And I know my dear
one, that whatever it was, and no matter how foolish it may have
been, it was not a wrong thing.  God knows, we are all apt to do
wrong things as well as foolish ones; the best of us.  But such is
not for you!  Your race, your father and mother, your upbringing,
yourself and the truth and purity which are yours would save you from
anything which was in itself wrong.  That I know, my dear, as well as
I know myself!  Ah! better, far better! for the gods did not think it
well to dower me as they have dowered you.  The God of all the gods
has given you the ten talents to guard; and He knows, as I do, that
you will be faithful to your trust.'

There was a solemn ring in her voce as the words were spoken which
went through the young girl's heart.  Love and confidence demanded in
return that she should have at least the relief of certain
acquiescence; there is a possible note of pain in the tensity of
every string!  Stephen lifted her head proudly and honestly, though
her cheeks were scarlet, saying with a consciousness of integrity
which spoke directly soul to soul:

'You are right, dear!  I have done something very foolish; very, very
foolish!  But it was nothing which any one could call wrong.  Do not
ask me what it was.  I need only tell you this:  that it was an
outrage on convention.  It was so foolish, and based on such foolish
misconception; it sprang from such over-weening, arrogant self-
opinion that it deserves the bitter punishment which will come; which
is coming; which is with me now!  It was the cause of something whose
blackness I can't yet realise; but of which I will tell you when I
can speak of it.  But it was not wrong in itself, or in the eyes of
God or man!'  The old woman said not a word.  No word was needed, for
had she not already expressed her belief?  But Stephen felt her
relief in the glad pressure of her finger-tips.  In a voice less
strained and tense Miss Rowly went on:

'What need have I for money, dear?  Here I have all that any woman,
especially at my age, can need.  There is no room even for charity;
you are so good to all your people that my help is hardly required.
And, my dear one, I know--I know,' she emphasised the word as she
stroked the beautiful hair, 'that when I am gone my own poor, the few
that I have looked after all my life, will, not suffer when my
darling thinks of me!'  Stephen fairly climbed upon her as she said,
looking in the brave old eyes:

'So help me God, my darling, they shall never want!'

Silence for a time; and then Miss Rowly's voice again:

'Though it would not do for the world to know that a young maiden
lady had paid the debts of a vicious young man, it makes no matter if
they be paid by an old woman, be the same maid, wife, or widow!  And
really, my dear, I do not see how any money I might have could be
better spent than in keeping harm away from you.'

'There need not be any harm at all, Auntie.'

'Perhaps not, dear!  I hope not with all my heart.  But I fear that
young man.  Just fancy him threatening you, and in your own house; in
my very presence!  Oh! yes, my dear.  He meant to threaten, anyhow!
Though I could not exactly understand what he was driving at, I could
see that he was driving at something.  And after all that you were
doing for him, and had done for him!  I mean, of course, after all
that I had done for him, and was doing for him.  It is mean enough,
surely, for a man to beg, and from a woman; but to threaten
afterwards.  Ach!  But I think, my dear, it is checkmate to him this
time.  All along the line the only proof that is of there being any
friendliness towards him from this house points to me.  And moreover,
my dear, I have a little plan in my head that will tend to show him
up even better, in case he may ever try to annoy us.  Look at me when
next he is here.  I mean to do a little play-acting which will
astonish him, I can tell you, if it doesn't frighten him out of the
house altogether.  But we won't talk of that yet.  You will
understand when you see it!'  Her eyes twinkled and her mouth shut
with a loud snap as she spoke.

After a few minutes of repose, which was like a glimpse of heaven to
Stephen's aching heart, she spoke again:

'There was something else that troubled you more than even this.  You
said you would tell me when you were able to speak of it . . . Why
not speak now?  Oh! my dear, our hearts are close together to-night;
and in all your life, you will never have any one who will listen
with greater sympathy than I will, or deal more tenderly with your
fault, whatever it may have been.  Tell me, dear!  Dear!' she
whispered after a pause, during which she realised the depth of the
girl's emotion by her convulsive struggling to keep herself in check.

All at once the tortured girl seemed to yield herself, and slipped
inertly from her grasp till kneeling down she laid her head in the
motherly lap and sobbed.  Miss Rowly kept stroking her hair in
silence.  Presently the girl looked up, and with a pang the aunt saw
that her eyes were dry.  In her pain she said:

'You sob like that, my child, and yet you are not crying; what is it,
oh! my dear one?  What is it that hurts you so that you cannot cry?'

And then the bitter sobbing broke out again, but still alas! without
tears.  Crouching low, and still enclosing her aunt's waist with her
outstretched arms and hiding her head in her breast; she said:

'Oh! Auntie, I have sent Harold away!'

'What, my dear?  What?' said the old lady astonished.  'Why, I
thought there was no one in the world that you trusted so much as
Harold!'

'It is true.  There was--there is no one except you whom I trust so
much.  But I mistook something he said.  I was in a blind fury at the
time, and I said things that I thought my father's daughter never
could have said.  And she never thought them, even then!  Oh, Auntie,
I drove him away with all the horrible things I could say that would
wound him.  And all because he acted in a way that I see now was the
most noble and knightly in which any man could act.  He that my dear
father had loved, and honoured, and trusted as another son.  He that
was a real son to him, and not a mock sop like me.  I sent him away
with such fierce and bitter pain that his poor face was ashen grey,
and there was woe in his eyes that shall make woe in mine whenever I
shall see them in my mind, waking or sleeping.  He, the truest friend
. . . the most faithful, the most tender, the most strong, the most
unselfish!  Oh! Auntie, Auntie, he just turned and bowed and went
away.  And he couldn't do anything else with the way I spoke to him;
and now I shall never see him again!'

The young girl's eyes ware still dry, but the old woman's were wet.
For a few minutes she kept softly stroking the bowed heat till the
sobbing grew less and less, and then died away; and the girl lay
still, collapsed in the abandonment of dry-eyed grief.

Then she rose, and taking off her dressing-gown, said tenderly:

'Let me stay with you to-night, dear one?  Go to sleep in my arms, as
you did long ago when there was any grief that you could not bear.'

So Stephen lay in those loving arms till her own young breast ceased
heaving, and she breathed softly.  Till dawn she slept on the bosom
of her who loved her so well.



CHAPTER XXI--THE DUTY OF COURTESY



Leonard was getting tired of waiting when he received his summons to
Normanstand.  But despite his impatience he was ill pleased with the
summons, which came in the shape of a polite note from Miss Rowly
asking him to come that afternoon at tea-time.  He had expected to
hear from Stephen.

'Damn that old woman!  You'd think she was working the whole show!'
However, he turned up at a little before five o'clock, spruce and
dapper and well dressed and groomed as usual.  He was shown, as
before, into the blue drawing-room.  Miss Rowly, who sat there, rose
as he entered, and coming across the room, greeted him, as he
thought, effusively.  He actually winced when she called him 'my dear
boy' before the butler.

She ordered tea to be served at once, and when it had been brought
she said to the butler:

'Tell Mannerly to bring me a large thick envelope which is on the
table in my room.  It is marked L.E. on the outside.'  Presently an
elderly maid handed her the envelope and withdrew.  When tea was over
she opened the envelope, and taking from it a number of folios,
looked over them carefully; holding them in her lap, she said
quietly:

'You will find writing materials on the table.  I am all ready now to
hand you over the receipts.'  His eyes glistened.  This was good news
at all events; the debts were paid.  In a rapid flash of thought he
came to the conclusion that if the debts were actually paid he need
not be civil to the old lady.  He felt that he could have been rude
to her if he had actual possession of the receipts.  As it was,
however, he could not yet afford to have any unpleasantness.  There
was still to come that lowering interview with his father; and he
could not look towards it satisfactorily until he had the assurance
of the actual documents that he was safe.  Miss Rowly was, in her own
way, reading his mind in his face.  Her lorgnon seemed to follow his
every expression like a searchlight.  He remembered his former
interview with her, and how he had been bested in it; so he made up
his mind to acquiesce in time.  He went over to the table and sat
down.  Taking a pen he turned to Miss Rowly and said:

'What shall I write?'  She answered calmly:

'Date it, and then say, ""Received from Miss Laetitia Rowly the
receipts for the following amounts from the various firms hereunder
enumerated.""'  She then proceeded to read them, he writing and
repeating as he wrote.  Then she added:

'""The same being the total amount of my debts which she has kindly
paid for me.""'  He paused here; she asked.

'Why don't you go on?'

'I thought it was Stephen--Miss Norman,' he corrected, catching sight
of her lorgnon, 'who was paying them.'

'Good Lord, man,' she answered, 'what does it matter who has paid
them, so long as they are paid?'

'But I didn't ask you to pay them,' he went on obstinately.  There
was a pause, and then the old lady, with a distinctly sarcastic
smile, said:

'It seems to me, young man, that you are rather particular as to how
things are done for you.  If you had begun to be just a little bit as
particular in making the debts as you are in the way of having them
paid, there would be a little less trouble and expense all round.
However, the debts have been paid, and we can't unpay them.  But of
course you can repay me the money if you like.  It amounts in all to
four thousand three hundred and seventeen pounds, twelve shillings
and sixpence, and I have paid every penny of it out of my own pocket.
If you can't pay it yourself, perhaps your father would like to do
so.'

The last shot told; he went on writing:  '""Kindly paid for me,""' she
continued in the same even voice:

'""In remembrance of my mother, of whom she was an acquaintance.""  Now
sign it!'  He did so and handed it to her.  She read it over
carefully, folded it, and put it in her pocket.  She then stood.  He
rose also; and as he moved to the door--he had not offered to shake
hands with her--he said:

'I should like to see, Miss Norman.'

'I am afraid you will have to wait.'

'Why?'

'She is over at Heply Regis.  She went there for Lady Heply's ball,
and will remain for a few days.  Good afternoon!'  The tone in which
the last two words were spoken seemed in his ears like the crow of
the victor after a cock-fight.

As he was going out of the room a thought struck her.  She felt he
deserved some punishment for his personal rudeness to her.  After
all, she had paid half her fortune for him, though not on his
account; and not only had he given no thanks, but had not even
offered the usual courtesy of saying good-bye.  She had intended to
have been silent on the subject, and to have allowed him to discover
it later.  Now she said, as if it was an after-thought:

'By the way, I did not pay those items you put down as ""debts of
honour""; you remember you gave the actual names and addresses.'

'Why not?' the question came from him involuntarily.  The persecuting
lorgnon rose again:

'Because they were all bogus!  Addresses, names, debts, honour!  Good
afternoon!'

He went out flaming; free from debt, money debts; all but one.  And
some other debts--not financial--whose magnitude was exemplified in
the grinding of his teeth.

After breakfast next morning he said to his father:

'By the way, you said you wished to speak to me, sir.'  There was
something in the tone of his voice which called up antagonism.

'Then you have paid your debts?'

'All!'

'Good!  Now there is something which it is necessary I should call
your attention to.  Do you remember the day on which I handed you
that pleasing epistle from Messrs. Cavendish and Cecil?'

'Certainly, sir.'

'Didn't you send a telegram to them?'

'I did.'

'You wrote it yourself?'

'Certainly.'

'I had a courteous letter from the money-lenders, thanking me for my
exertions in securing the settlement of their claim, and saying that
in accordance with the request in my telegram they had held over
proceedings until the day named.  I did not quite remember having
sent any telegram to them, or any letter either.  So, being at a
loss, I went to our excellent postmaster and requested that he would
verify the sending of a telegram to London from me.  He courteously
looked up the file; which was ready for transference to the G.P.O.,
and showed me the form.  It was in your handwriting.'  He paused so
long that Leonard presently said:

'Well!'

'It was signed Jasper Everard.  Jasper Everard! my name; and yet it
was sent by my son, who was christened, if I remember rightly,
Leonard!'  Then he went on, only in a cold acrid manner which made
his son feel as though a February wind was blowing on his back:

'I think there need not have been much trouble in learning to avoid
confusing our names.  They are really dissimilar.  Have you any
explanation to offer of the--the error, let us call it?'  A bright
thought struck Leonard.

'Why, sir,' he said, 'I put it in your name as they had written to
you.  I thought it only courteous.'  The elder man winced; he had not
expected the excuse.  We went on speaking in the same calm way, but
his tone was more acrid than before:

'Good! of course!  It was only courteous of you!  Quite so!  But I
think it will be well in the future to let me look after my own
courtesy; as regards my signature at any rate.  You see, my dear boy,
a signature is queer sort of thing, and judges and juries are apt to
take a poor view of courtesy as over against the conventions
regarding a man, writing his own name.  What I want to tell you is
this, that on seeing that signature I made a new will.  You see, my
estate is not entailed, and therefore I think it only right to see
that in such a final matter justice is done all round.  I therefore
made a certain provision of which I am sure you will approve.
Indeed, since I am assured of the payment of your debts, I feel
justified in my action.  I may say, inter alia, that I congratulate
you on either the extent of your resources or the excellence of your
friendships, or both.  I confess that the amounts brought to my
notice were rather large; more especially in proportion to the value
of the estate which you are some day to inherit.  For you are of
course to inherit some day, my dear boy.  You are my only son, and it
would be hardly--hardly courteous of me not to leave it to you.  But
I have put a clause in my will to the effect that the trustee's are
to pay all debts of your accruing which can be proved against you,
before handing over to you either the estate itself or the remainder
after its sale and the settlement of all claims.  That's all.  Now
run away, my boy; I have some important work to do.'


The day after her return from Heply Regis, Stephen was walking in the
wood when she thought she heard a slight rustling of leaves some way
behind her.  She looked round, expecting to see some one; but the
leafy path was quite clear.  Her suspicion was confirmed; some one
was secretly following her.  A short process of exclusions pointed to
the personality of the some one.  Tramps and poachers were unknown in
Normanstand, and there was no one else whom she could think of who
had any motive in following her in such a way; it must be Leonard
Everard.  She turned and walked rapidly in the opposite direction.
As this would bring her to the house Leonard had to declare his
presence at once or else lose the opportunity of a private interview
which he sought.  When she saw him she said at once and without any
salutation:

'What are you doing there; why are you following me?'

'I wanted to see you alone.  I could not get near you on account of
that infernal old woman.'  Stephen's face grew hard.

'On account of whom?' she asked with dangerous politeness.

'Miss Rowly; your aunt.'

'Don't you think, Mr. Everard,' she said icily, 'that it is at least
an unpardonable rudeness to speak that way, and to me, of the woman I
love best in all the world?'

'Sorry!' he said in the offhand way of younger days, 'I apologise.
Fact is, I was angry that she wouldn't let me see you.'

'Not let you see me!' she said as if amazed.  'What do mean?'

'Why, I haven't been able to see you alone ever since I went to meet
you on Caester Hill.'

'But why should you see me alone?' she asked as if still in
amazement.  'Surely you can say anything you have to say before my
aunt.'  With an unwisdom for which an instant later he blamed himself
he blurted out:

'Why, old girl, you yourself did not think her presence necessary
when you asked me to meet you on the hill.'

'When was that?'  She saw that he was angry and wanted to test him;
to try how far he would venture.  He was getting dangerous; she must
know the measure of what she had to fear.

He fell into the trap at once.  His debts being paid, fear was
removed, and all the hectoring side of the man was aroused.  His
antagonist was a woman; and he had already had in his life so many
unpleasant scenes with women that this was no new experience.  This
woman had, by her own indiscretion, put a whip into his hand; and, if
necessary to secure his own way, by God! he meant to use it!  These
last days had made her a more desirable possession in his eyes.  The
vastness of her estate had taken hold on him, and his father's
remorseless intention with regard to his will would either keep him
with very limited funds, or leave him eventually a pauper if he
forestalled his inheritance.  The desire of her wealth had grown
daily, and it was now the main force in bringing him here to-day.
And to this was now added the personal desire which her presence
evoked.  Stephen, at all times beautiful, had never looked more
lovely.  In the days since she had met him on the hilltop, a time
that to her seemed so long ago, she had grown to be a woman, and
there is some subtle inconceivable charm in completed womanhood.  The
reaction from her terrible fear and depression had come, and her
strong brilliant youth was manifesting itself.  Her step was springy
and her eyes were bright; and the glow of fine health, accentuated by
the militant humour of the present moment, seemed to light up her
beautiful skin.  In herself she was desirable, very desirable;
Leonard felt his pulses quicken and his blood leap as he looked at
her.  Even his prejudice against her red hair had changed to
something like hungry admiration.  Leonard felt for the first moment
since he had known her that she was a woman; and that, with relation
to her, he was a man.

And at the moment all the man in him asserted itself.  It was with
half love, as he saw it, and half self-assertion that he answered her
question:

'The day you asked me to marry you!  Oh! what a fool I was not to
leap at such a chance!  I should have taken you in my arms then and
kissed you till I showed you how much I loved you.  But that will all
come yet; the kissing is still to come!  Oh!  Stephen, don't you see
that I love you?  Won't you tell me that you love me still?
Darling!'  He almost sprang at her, his arms extended to clasp her.

'Stop!'  Her voice rang like a trumpet.  She did not mean to submit
to physical violence, and in the present state of her feeling, an
embrace from him would be a desecration.  He was now odious to her;
she positively loathed him.

Before her uplifted hand and those flashing eyes, he stopped as one
stricken into stone.  In that instant she knew she was safe; and with
a woman's quickness of apprehension and resolve, made up her mind
what course to pursue.  In a calm voice she said quietly:

'Mr. Everard, you have followed me in secret, and without my
permission.  I cannot talk here with you, alone.  I absolutely refuse
to do so; now or at any other time.  If you have anything especial to
say to me you will find me at home at noon to-morrow.  Remember, I do
not ask you to come.  I simply yield to the pressure of your
importunity.  And remember also that I do not authorise you in any
way to resume this conversation.  In fact, I forbid it.  If you come
to my house you must control yourself to my wish!'

Then with a stately bow, whose imperious distance inflamed him more
than ever, and without once looking back she took her way home, all
agitated inwardly and with fast beating heart.



CHAPTER XXII--FIXING THE BOUNDS



Leonard came towards Normanstand next forenoon in considerable mental
disturbance.  In the first place he was seriously in love with
Stephen, and love is in itself a disturbing influence.

Leonard's love was all of the flesh; and as such had power at present
to disturb him, as it would later have power to torture him.  Again,
he was disturbed by the fear of losing Stephen, or rather of not
being able to gain her.  At first, ever since she had left him on the
path from the hilltop till his interview the next day, he had looked
on her possession as an 'option,' to the acceptance of which
circumstances seemed to be compelling him.  But ever since, that
asset seemed to have been dwindling; and now he was almost beginning
to despair.  He was altogether cold at heart, and yet highly strung
with apprehension, as he was shown into the blue drawing-room.

Stephen came in alone, closing the door behind her.  She shook hands
with him, and sat down by a writing-table near the window, pointing
to him to sit on an ottoman a little distance away.  The moment he
sat down he realised that he was at a disadvantage; he was not close
to her, and he could not get closer without manifesting his intention
of so doing.  He wanted to be closer, both for the purpose of his
suit and for his own pleasure; the proximity of Stephen began to
multiply his love for her.  He thought that to-day she looked better
than ever, of a warm radiant beauty which touched his senses with
unattainable desire.  She could not but notice the passion in his
eyes, and instinctively her eyes wandered to a silver gong placed on
the table well within reach.  The more he glowed, the more icily calm
she sat, till the silence between them began to grow oppressive.  She
waited, determined that he should be the first to speak.  Recognising
the helplessness of silence, he began huskily:

'I came here to-day in the hope that you would listen to me.'  Her
answer, given with a conventional smile, was not helpful:

'I am listening.'

'I cannot tell you how sorry I am that I did not accept your offer.
If I had know when I was coming that day that you loved me . . . '
She interrupted him, calm of voice, and with uplifted hand:

'I never said so, did I?  Surely I could not have said such a thing!
I certainly don't remember it?'  Leonard was puzzled.

'You certainly made me think so.  You asked me to marry you, didn't
you?'  Her answer came calmly, though in a low voice:

'I did.'

'Then if you didn't love me, why did you ask me to marry you?'  It
was his nature to be more or less satisfied when he had put any one
opposed to him proportionally in the wrong; and now his exultation at
having put a poser manifested itself in his tone.  This, however,
braced up Stephen to cope with a difficult and painful situation.  It
was with a calm, seemingly genial frankness, that she answered,
smilingly:

'Do you know, that is what has been puzzling me from that moment to
this!'  Her words appeared to almost stupefy Leonard.  This view of
the matter had not occurred to him, and now the puzzle of it made him
angry.

'Do you mean to say,' he asked hotly, 'that you asked a man to marry
you when you didn't even love him?'

'That is exactly what I do mean!  Why I did it is, I assure you, as
much a puzzle to me as it is to you.  I have come to the conclusion
that it must have been from my vanity.  I suppose I wanted to
dominate somebody; and you were the weakest within range!'

'Thank you!'  He was genuinely angry by this time, and, but for a
wholesome fear of the consequences, would have used strong language.

'I don't see that I was the weakest about.'  Somehow this set her on
her guard.  She wanted to know more, so she asked:

'Who else?'

'Harold An Wolf!  You had him on a string already!'  The name came
like a sword through her heart, but the bitter comment braced her to
further caution.  Her voice seemed to her to sound as though far
away:

'Indeed!  And may I ask you how you came to know that?'  Her voice
seemed so cold and sneering to him that he lost his temper still
further.

'Simply because he told me so himself.'  It pleased him to do in ill
turn to Harold.  He did not forget that savage clutch at his throat;
and he never would.  Stephen's senses were all alert.  She saw an
opportunity of learning something, and went on with the same cold
voice:

'And I suppose it was that pleasing confidence which was the cause of
your refusal of my offer of marriage; of which circumstance you have
so thoughtfully and so courteously reminded me.'  This, somehow,
seemed of good import to Leonard.  If he could show her that his
intention to marry her was antecedent to Harold's confidence, she
might still go back to her old affection for him.  He could not
believe that it did not still exist; his experience of other women
showed him that their love outlived their anger, whether the same had
been hot or cold.

'It had nothing in the world to do with it.  He never said a word
about it till he threatened to kill me--the great brute!'  This was
learning something indeed!  She went on in the same voice:

'And may I ask you what was the cause of such sanguinary intention?'

'Because he knew that I was going to marry you!'  As he spoke he felt
that he had betrayed himself; he went on hastily, hoping that it
might escape notice:

'Because he knew that I loved you.  Oh! Stephen, don't you know it
now!  Can't you see that I love you; and that I want you for my
wife!'

'But did he threaten to kill you out of mere jealousy?  Do you still
go in fear of your life?  Will it be necessary to arrest him?'
Leonard was chagrined at her ignoring of his love-suit, and in his
self-engrossment answered sulkily:

'I'm not afraid of him!  And, besides, I believe he has bolted.  I
called at his house yesterday, and his servant said they hadn't heard
a word from him.'  Stephen's heart sank lower and lower.  This was
what she had dreaded.  She said in as steady a voice as she could
muster:

'Bolted!  Has he gone altogether?'

'Oh, he'll come back all right, in time.  He's not going to give up
the jolly good living he has here!'

'But why has he bolted?  When he threatened to kill you did he give
any reason?'  There was too much talk about Harold.  It made him
angry; so he answered in an offhand way:

'Oh, I don't know.  And, moreover, I don't care!'

'And now,' said Stephen, having ascertained what she wanted to know,
'what is it that you want to speak to me about?'

Her words fell on Leonard like a cold douche.  Here had he been
talking about his love for her, and yet she ignored the whole thing,
and asked him what he wanted to talk about.

'What a queer girl you are.  You don't seem to attend to what a
fellow is saying.  Here have I been telling you that I love you, and
asking you to marry me; and yet you don't seem to have even heard
me!'  She answered at once, quite sweetly, and with a smile of
superiority which maddened him:

'But that subject is barred!'

'How do you mean?  Barred!'

'Yes.  I told you yesterday!'

'But, Stephen,' he cried out quickly, all the alarm in him and all
the earnestness of which he was capable uniting to his strengthening,
'can't you understand that I love you, with all my heart?  You are so
beautiful; so beautiful!'  He felt now in reality what he was saying.

The torrent of his words left no opening for her objection; it swept
all merely verbal obstacles before it.  She listened, content in a
measure.  So long as he sat at the distance which she had arranged
before his coming she did not fear any personal violence.  Moreover,
it was a satisfaction to her now to hear him, who had refused her,
pleading in vain.  The more sincere his eloquence, the larger her
satisfaction; she had no pity for him now.

'I know I was a fool, Stephen!  I had my chance that day on the
hilltop; and if I had felt then as I feel now, as I have felt every
moment since, I would not have been so cold.  I would have taken you
in my arms and held you close and kissed you, again, and again, and
again.  Oh, darling!  I love you!  I love you!  I love you!'  He held
out his arms imploringly.  'Won't you love me?  Won't--'

He stopped, paralysed with angry amazement.  She was laughing.

He grew purple in the face; his hands were still outstretched.  The
few seconds seemed like hours.

'Forgive me!' she said in a polite tone, suddenly growing grave.
'But really you looked so funny, sitting there so quietly, and
speaking in such a way, that I couldn't help it.  You really must
forgive me!  But remember, I told you the subject was barred; and as,
knowing that, you went on, you really have no one but yourself to
blame!'  Leonard was furious, but managed to say as he dropped his
arms:

'But I love you!'

'That may be, now,' she went on icily.  'But it is too late.  I do
not love you; and I have never loved you!  Of course, had you
accepted my offer of marriage you should never have known that.  No
matter how great had been my shame and humiliation when I had come to
a sense of what I had done, I should have honourably kept my part of
the tacit compact entered into when I made that terrible mistake.  I
cannot tell you how rejoiced and thankful I am that you took my
mistake in such a way.  Of course, I do not give you any credit for
it; you thought only of yourself, and did that which you liked best!'

'That is a nice sort of thing to tell a man!' he interrupted with
cynical frankness.

'Oh, I do not want to hurt you unnecessarily; but I wish there to be
no possible misconception in the matter.  Now that I have discovered
my error I am not likely to fall into it again; and that you may not
have any error at all, I tell you now again, that I have not loved
you, do not love you, and never will and never can love you.'  Here
an idea struck Leonard and he blurted out:

'But do you not think that something is due to me?'

'How do you mean?'  Her brows were puckered with real wonder this
time.

'For false hopes raised in my mind.  If I did not love you before,
the very act of proposing to me has made me love you; and now I love
you so well that I cannot live without you!'  In his genuine
agitation he was starting up, when the sight of her hand laid upon
the gong arrested him.  She laughed as she said:

'I thought that the privilege of changing one's mind was a female
prerogative!  Besides, I have done already something to make
reparation to you for the wrong of . . . of--I may put it fairly, as
the suggestion is your own--of not having treated you as a woman!'

'Damn!'

'As you observe so gracefully, it is annoying to have one's own silly
words come back at one, boomerang fashion.  I made up my mind to do
something for you; to pay off your debts.'  This so exasperated him
that he said out brutally:

'No thanks to you for that!  As I had to put up with the patronage
and the lecturings, and the eyeglass of that infernal old woman, I
don't intend . . . '

Stephen stood up, her hand upon the gong:

'Mr. Everard, if you do not remember that you are in my drawing-room,
and speaking of my dear and respected aunt, I shall not detain you
longer!'

He sat down at once, saying surlily:

'I beg your pardon.  I forgot.  You make me so wild that--that . . .
'  He chewed the ends of his moustache angrily.  She resumed her
seat, taking her hand from the gong.  Without further pause she
continued:

'Quite right!  It has been Miss Rowly who paid your debts.  At first
I had promised myself the pleasure; but from something in your speech
and manner she thought it better that such an act should not be done
by a woman in my position to a man in yours.  It might, if made
public, have created quite a wrong impression in the minds of many of
our friends.'

There was something like a snort from Leonard.  She ignored it:

'So she paid the money herself out of her own fortune.  And, indeed,
I must say that you do not seem to have treated her with much
gratitude.'

'What did I say or do that put you off doing the thing yourself?'

'I shall answer it frankly:  It was because you manifested, several
times, in a manner there was no mistaking, both by words and deeds,
an intention of levying blackmail on me by using your knowledge of my
ridiculous, unmaidenly act.  No one can despise, or deplore, or
condemn that act more than I do; so that rather than yield a single
point to you, I am, if necessary, ready to face the odium which the
public knowledge of it might produce.  What I had intended to do for
you in the way of compensation for false hopes raised to you by that
act has now been done.  That it was done by my aunt on my behalf, and
not by me, matters to you no more than it did to your creditors, who,
when they received the money, made no complaint of injury to their
feelings on that account.

'Now, when you think the whole matter over in quietness, you will,
knowing that I am ready at any time to face if necessary the
unpleasant publicity, be able to estimate what damage you would do to
yourself by any expose.  It seems to me that you would come out of it
pretty badly all round.  That, however, is not my affair; it entirely
rests with yourself.  I think I know how women would regard it.  I
dare say you best know how men would look at it; and at you!'

Leonard knew already how the only man who knew of it had taken it,
and the knowledge did not reassure him!

'You jade!  You infernal, devilish, cruel, smooth-tongued jade!'  He
stood as bespoke.  She stood too, and stood watching him with her
hand on the gong.  After a pause of a couple of seconds she said
gravely:

'One other thing I should wish to say, and I mean it.  Understand me
clearly, that I mean it!  You must not come again into my grounds
without my special permission.  I shall not allow my liberty to be
taken away, or restricted, by you.  If there be need at any time to
come to the house, come in ceremonious fashion, by the avenues which
are used by others.  You can always speak to me in public, or
socially, in the most friendly manner; as I shall hope to be able to
speak to you.  But you must never transgress the ordinary rules of
decorum.  If you do, I shall have to take, for my own protection,
another course.  I know you now!  I am willing to blot out the past;
but it must be the whole past that is wiped out!'

She stood facing him; and as he looked at her clear-cut aquiline
face, her steady eyes, her resolute mouth, her carriage, masterly in
its self-possessed poise, he saw that there was no further hope for
him.  There was no love and no fear.

'You devil!' he hissed.

She struck the gong; her aunt entered the room.

'Oh, is that you, Auntie?  Mr. Everard has finished his business with
me!'  Then to the servant, who had entered after Miss Rowly:

'Mr. Everard would like his carriage.  By the way,' she added,
turning to him in a friendly way as an afterthought, 'will you not
stay, Mr. Everard, and take lunch with us?  My aunt has been rather
moping lately; I am sure your presence would cheer her up.'

'Yes, do stay, Mr. Everard!' added Miss Rowly placidly.  'It would
make a pleasant hour for us all.'

Leonard, with a great effort, said with conventional politeness:

'Thanks, awfully!  But I promised my father to be home for lunch!'
and he withdrew to the door which the servant held open.

He went out filled with anger and despair, and, sad for him, with a
fierce, overmastering desire--love he called it--for the clever,
proud, imperious beauty who had so outmatched and crushed him.

That beautiful red head, which he had at first so despised, was
henceforth to blaze in his dreams.



CHAPTER XXIII--THE MAN



On the Scoriac Harold An Wolf, now John Robinson, kept aloof from
every one.  He did not make any acquaintances, did not try to.  Some
of those at table with him, being ladies and gentlemen, now and again
made a polite remark; to which he answered with equal politeness.
Being what he was he could not willingly offend any one; and there
was nothing in his manner to repel any kindly overture to
acquaintance.  But this was the full length his acquaintanceship
went; so he gradually felt himself practically alone.  This was just
what he wished; he sat all day silent and alone, or else walked up
and down the great deck that ran from stem to stern, still always
alone.  As there were no second-class or steerage passengers on the
Scoriac, there were no deck restraints, and so there was ample room
for individual solitude.  The travellers, however, were a sociable
lot, and a general feeling of friendliness was abroad.  The first
four days of the journey were ideally fine, and life was a joy.  The
great ship, with bilge keels, was as steady as a rock.

Among the other passengers was an American family consisting of
Andrew Stonehouse, the great ironmaster and contractor, with his wife
and little daughter.

Stonehouse was a remarkable man in his way, a typical product of the
Anglo-Saxon under American conditions.  He had started in young
manhood with nothing but a good education, due in chief to his own
industry and his having taken advantage to the full of such
opportunities as life had afforded to him.  By unremitting work he
had at thirty achieved a great fortune, which had, however; been up
to then entirely invested and involved in his businesses.  With,
however, the colossal plant at his disposal, and by aid of the fine
character he had won for honesty and good work, he was able within
the next ten years to pile up a fortune vast even in a nation where
multi-millionaires are scattered freely.  Then he had married, wisely
and happily.  But no child had come to crown the happiness of the
pair who so loved each other till a good many years had come and
gone.  Then, when the hope of issue had almost passed away, a little
daughter came.  Naturally the child was idolised by her parents, and
thereafter every step taken by either was with an eye to her good.
When the rigour of winter and the heat of summer told on the child in
a way which the more hardy parents had never felt, she was whirled
away to some place with more promising conditions of health and
happiness.  When the doctors hinted that an ocean voyage and a winter
in Italy would be good, those too were duly undertaken.  And now, the
child being in perfect health, the family was returning before the
weather should get too hot to spend the summer at their chalet
amongst the great pines on the slopes of Mount Ranier.  Like the
others on board, Mr. and Mrs. Stonehouse had proffered travellers'
civilities to the sad, lonely young man.  As to the others, he had
shown thanks for their gracious courtesy; but friendship, as in other
cases, did not advance.  The Stonehouses were not in any way
chagrined; their lives were too happy and too full for them to take
needless offence.  They respected the young man's manifest desire for
privacy; and there, so far as they were concerned, the matter rested.

But this did not suit the child.  Pearl was a sweet little thing, a
real blue-eyed, golden-haired little fairy, full of loving-kindness.
All the mother-instinct in her, and even at six a woman-child can be
a mother--theoretically, went out towards the huge, lonely, sad,
silent young man.  She insisted on friendship with him; insisted
shamelessly, with the natural inclination of innocence which rises
high above shame.  Even the half-hearted protests of the mother, who
loved to see the child happy, did not deter her; after the second
occasion of Pearl's seeking him, as she persisted, Harold could but
remonstrate with the mother in turn; the ease of the gentle lady and
the happiness of her child were more or less at stake.  When Mrs.
Stonehouse would say:

'There, darling!  You must be careful not to annoy the gentleman,'
Pearl would turn a rosy all-commanding face to her and answer:

'But, mother, I want him to play with me.  You must play with me!'
Then, as the mother would look at him, he would say quickly, and with
genuine heartiness too:

'Oh please, madam, do let her play with me!  Come, Pearl, shall you
ride a cock-horse or go to market the way the gentleman rides?'  Then
the child would spring on his knee with a cry of delight, and their
games began.

The presence of the child and her loving ways were unutterably sweet
to Harold; but his pleasure was always followed by a pain that rent
him as he thought of that other little one, now so far away, and of
those times that seemed so long since gone.

But the child never relaxed in her efforts to please; and in the long
hours of the sea voyage the friendship between her and the man grew,
and grew.  He was the biggest and strongest and therefore most lovely
thing on board the ship, and that sufficed her.  As for him, the
child manifestly loved and trusted him, and that was all-in-all to
his weary, desolate heart.

The fifth day out the weather began to change; the waves grew more
and more mountainous as the day wore on and the ship advanced west.
Not even the great bulk and weight of the ship, which ordinarily
drove through the seas without pitch or roll, were proof against
waves so gigantic.  Then the wind grew fiercer and fiercer, coming in
roaring squalls from the south-west.  Most of those on board were
alarmed, for the great waves were dreadful to see, and the sound of
the wind was a trumpet-call to fear.

The sick stayed in their cabins; the rest found an interest if not a
pleasure on deck.  Among the latter were the Stonehouses, who were
old travellers.  Even Pearl had already had more sea-voyages than
fall to most people in their lives.  As for Harold, the storm seemed
to come quite naturally to him and he paced the deck like a ship-
master.

It was fortunate for the passengers that most of them had at this
period of the voyage got their sea legs; otherwise walking on the
slippery deck, that seemed to heave as the rolling of the vessel
threw its slopes up or down, would have been impossible.  Pearl was,
like most children, pretty sure-footed; holding fast to Harold's hand
she managed to move about ceaselessly.  She absolutely refused to go
with any one else.  When her mother said that she had better sit
still she answered:

'But, mother, I am quite safe with The Man!'  'The Man' was the name
she had given Harold, and by which she always now spoke of him.  They
had had a good many turns together, and Harold had, with the
captain's permission, taken her up on the bridge and showed her how
to look out over the 'dodger' without the wind hurting her eyes.
Then came the welcome beef-tea hour, and all who had come on deck
were cheered and warmed with the hot soup.  Pearl went below, and
Harold, in the shelter of the charthouse, together with a good many
others, looked out over the wild sea.

Harold, despite the wild turmoil of winds and seas around him, which
usually lifted his spirits, was sad, feeling lonely and wretched; he
was suffering from the recoil of his little friend's charming
presence.  Pearl came on deck again looking for him.  He did not see
her, and the child, seeing an opening for a new game, avoided both
her father and mother, who also stood in the shelter of the
charthouse, and ran round behind it on the weather side, calling a
loud 'Boo!' to attract Harold's attention as she ran.

A few seconds later the Scoriac put her nose into a coming wave at
just the angle which makes for the full exercise of the opposing
forces.  The great wave seemed to strike the ship on the port quarter
like a giant hammer; and for an instant she stood still, trembling.
Then the top of the wave seemed to leap up and deluge her.  The wind
took the flying water and threw it high in volumes of broken spray,
which swept not only the deck but the rigging as high as the top of
the funnels.  The child saw the mass of water coming, and shrieking
flew round the port side of the charthouse.  But just as she turned
down the open space between it and the funnel the vessel rolled to
starboard.  At the same moment came a puff of wind of greater
violence than ever.  The child, calling out, half in simulated half
in real fear, flew down the slope.  As she did so the gale took her,
and in an instant whirled her, almost touching her mother, over the
rail into the sea.

Mrs. Stonehouse shrieked and sprang forward as though to follow her
child.  She was held back by the strong arm of her husband.  They
both slipped on the sloping deck and fell together into the scuppers.
There was a chorus of screams from all the women present.  Harold,
with an instinctive understanding of the dangers yet to be
encountered, seized a red tam-o'-shanter from the head of a young
girl who stood near.

Her exclamation of surprise was drowned in the fearful cry 'Man
overboard!' and all rushed down to the rail and saw Harold, as he
emerged from the water, pull the red cap over his head and then swim
desperately towards the child, whose golden hair was spread on the
rising wave.

The instant after Pearl's being swept overboard might be seen the
splendid discipline of a well-ordered ship.  Every man to his post,
and every man with a knowledge of his duty.  The First Officer called
to the Quartermaster at the wheel in a voice which cut through the
gale like a trumpet:

'Hard a port!  Hard!'

The stern of the great ship swung away to port in time to clear the
floating child from the whirling screw, which would have cut her to
pieces in an instant.  Then the Officer after tearing the engine-room
signal to 'Starboard engine full speed astern,' ran for the lifebuoy
hanging at the starboard end of the bridge.  This he hurled far into
the sea.  As it fell the attached rope dragged with it the signal,
which so soon as it reaches water bursts into smoke and flame--signal
by day and night.  This done, and it had all been done in a couple of
seconds, he worked the electric switch of the syren, which screamed
out quickly once, twice, thrice.  This is the dread sound which means
'man overboard,' and draws to his post every man on the ship, waking
or sleeping.

The Captain was now on the bridge and in command, and the First
Officer, freed from his duty there, ran to the emergency boat, swung
out on its davits on the port side.

All this time, though only numbered by seconds, the Scoriac was
turning hard to starboard, making a great figure of eight; for it is
quicker to turn one of these great sea monsters round than to stop
her in mid career.  The aim of her Captain in such cases is to bring
her back to the weather side of the floating buoy before launching
the boat.

On deck the anguish of the child's parents was pitiable.  Close to
the rail, with her husband's arms holding her tight to it, the
distressed mother leaned out; but always moving so that she was at
the nearest point of the ship to her child.  As the ship passed on it
became more difficult to see the heads.  In the greater distance they
seemed to be quite close together.  All at once, just as a great wave
which had hidden them in the farther trough passed on, the mother
screamed out:

'She's sinking! she's sinking!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!' and she fell on
her knees, her horrified eyes, set in a face of ashen grey, looking
out between the rails.

But at the instant all eyes saw the man's figure rise in the water as
he began to dive.  There was a hush which seemed deadly; the
onlookers feared to draw breath.  And then the mother's heart leaped
and her cry rang out again as two heads rose together in the waste of
sea:

'He has her!  He has her!  He has her!  Oh, thank God!  Thank God!'
and for a single instant she hid her face in her hands.

Then when the fierce 'hurrah' of all on board had been hushed in
expectation, the comments broke forth.  Most of the passengers had by
this time got glasses of one kind or another.

'See!  He's putting the cap on the child's head.  He's a cool one
that.  Fancy him thinking of a red cap at such a time!'

'Ay! we could see that cap, when it might be we couldn't see anything
else.'

'Look!' this from an old sailor standing by his boat, 'how he's
raisin' in the water.  He's keeping his body between her an' the
spindrift till the squall has passed.  That would choke them both in
a wind like this if he didn't know how to guard against it.  He's all
right; he is!  The little maid is safe wi' him.'

'Oh, bless you!  Bless you for those words,' said the mother, turning
towards him.  'At this moment the Second Officer, who had run down
from the bridge, touched Mr. Stonehouse on the shoulder.

'The captain asked me to tell you, sir, that you and Mrs. Stonehouse
had better come to him on the bridge.  You'll see better from there.'

They both hurried up, and the mother again peered out with fixed
eyes.  The Captain tried to comfort her; laying his strong hand on
her shoulder, he said:

'There, there!  Take comfort, ma'am.  She is in the hands of God!
All that mortal man can do is being done.  And she is safer with that
gallant young giant than she could be with any other man on the ship.
Look, how he is protecting her!  Why he knows that all that can be
done is being done.  He is waiting for us to get to him, and is
saving himself for it.  Any other man who didn't know so much about
swimming as he does would try to reach the lifebuoy; and would choke
the two of them with the spindrift in the trying.  Mind how he took
the red cap to help us see them.  He's a fine lad that; a gallant
lad!'



CHAPTER XXIV--FROM THE DEEPS



Presently the Captain handed Mrs. Stonehouse a pair of binoculars.
For an instant she looked through them, then handed them back and
continued gazing out to where the two heads appeared--when they did
appear on the crest of the waves like pin-heads.  The Captain said
half to himself and half to the father:

'Mother's eyes!  Mother's eyes!' and the father understood.

As the ship swept back to the rescue, her funnels sending out huge
volumes of smoke which the gale beat down on the sea to leeward, the
excitement grew tenser and tenser.  Men dared hardly breathe; women
wept and clasped their hands convulsively as they prayed.  In the
emergency boat the men sat like statues, their oars upright, ready
for instant use.  The officer stood with the falls in his hand ready
to lower away.

When opposite the lifebuoy, and about a furlong from Harold and
Pearl, the Captain gave the signal 'Stop,' and then a second later:
'Full speed astern.'

'Ready, men!  Steady!'  As the coming wave slipping under the ship
began to rise up her side, the officer freed the falls and the boat
sank softly into the lifting sea.

Instantly the oars struck the water, and as the men bent to them a
cheer rang out.


Harold and Pearl heard, and the man turning his head for a moment saw
that the ship was close at hand, gradually drifting down to the
weather side of them.  He raised the child in his arms, saying:

'Now, Pearl, wave your hand to mother and say, hurrah!'  The child,
fired into fresh hope, waved her tiny hand and cried 'Hurrah!
Hurrah!'  The sound could not reach the mother's ears; but she saw,
and her heart leaped.  She too waved her hand, but she uttered no
sound.  The sweet high voice of the child crept over the water to the
ears of the men in the boat, and seemed to fire their arms with
renewed strength.

A few more strokes brought them close, Harold with a last effort
raised the child in his arms as the boat drove down on them.  The
boatswain leaning over the bow grabbed the child, and with one sweep
of his strong arm took her into the boat.  The bow oarsman caught
Harold by the wrist.  The way of the boat took him for a moment under
water; but the next man; pulling his oar across the boat, stooped
over and caught him by the collar, and clung fast.  A few seconds
more and he was hauled abroad.  A wild cheer from all on the Scoriac
came, sweeping down on the wind.

When once the boat's head had been turned towards the ship, and the
oars had bent again to their work, they came soon within shelter.
When they had got close enough ropes were thrown out, caught and made
fast; and then came down one of the bowlines which the seamen held
ready along the rail of the lower deck.  This was seized by the
boatswain, who placed it round him under his armpits.  Then, standing
with the child in his arms he made ready to be pulled up.  Pearl held
out her arms to Harold, crying in fear:

'No, no, let The Man take me!  I want to go with The Man!'  He said
quietly so as not to frighten her:

'No, no, dear!  Go with him!  He can do this better than I can!'  So
she clung quietly to the seaman, holding her face pressed close
against his shoulder.  As the men above pulled at the rope, keeping
it as far as possible from the side of the vessel, the boatswain
fended himself off with his feet.  In a few seconds he was seized by
eager hands and pulled over the rail, tenderly holding and guarding
the child all the while.  In an instant she was in the arms of her
mother, who had thrown herself upon her knees and pressed her close
to her loving heart.  The child put her little arms around her neck
and clung to her.  Then looking up and seeing the grey pallor of her
face, which even her great joy could not in a moment efface, she
stroked it and said:

'Poor mother!  Poor mother!  And now I have made you all wet!'  Then,
feeling her father's hand on her head she turned and leaped into his
arms, where he held her close.

Harold was the next to ascend.  He came amid a regular tempest of
cheers, the seamen joining with the passengers.  The officers, led by
the Captain waving his cap from the bridge, joined in the paean.

The boat was cast loose.  An instant after the engine bells tinkled:
'Full speed ahead.'

Mrs. Stonehouse had no eyes but for her child, except for one other.
When Harold leaped down from the rail she rushed at him, all those
around instinctively making way for her.  She flung her arms around
him and kissed him, and then before he could stop her sank to her
knees at his feet, and taking his hand kissed it.  Harold was
embarrassed beyond all thinking.  He tried to take away his hand, but
she clung tight to it.

'No, no!' she cried.  'You saved my child!'

Harold was a gentleman and a kindly one.  He said no word till she
had risen, still holding his hand, when he said quietly:

'There! there!  Don't cry.  I was only too happy to be of service.
Any other man on board would have done the same.  I was the nearest,
and therefore had to be first.  That was all!'

Mr. Stonehouse came to him and said as he grasped Harold's hand so
hard that his fingers ached:

'I cannot thank you as I would.  But you are a man and will
understand.  God be good to you as you have been good to my child;
and to her mother and myself!'  As he turned away Pearl, who had now
been holding close to her mother's hand, sprang to him holding up her
arms.  He raised her up and kissed her.  Then he placed her back in
her mother's arms.

All at once she broke down as the recollection of danger swept back
upon her.  'Oh, Mother!  Mother!' she cried, with a long, low wail,
which touched every one of her hearers to the heart's core.

'The hot blankets are all ready.  Come, there is not a moment to be
lost.  I'll be with you when I have seen the men attended to!'

So the mother, holding her in her arms and steadied by two seamen
lest she should slip on the wet and slippery deck, took the child
below.

Harold was taken by another set of men, who rubbed him down till he
glowed, and poured hot brandy and water into him till he had to
almost use force against the superabundance of their friendly
ministrations.

For the remainder of that day a sort of solemn gladness ruled on the
Scoriac.  The Stonehouse family remained in their suite, content in
glad thankfulness to be with Pearl, who lay well covered up on the
sofa sleeping off the effects of the excitement and the immersion,
and the result of the potation which the Doctor had forced upon her.
Harold was simply shy, and objecting to the publicity which he felt
to be his fate, remained in his cabin till the trumpet had blown the
dinner call.



CHAPTER XXV--A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD



After dinner Harold went back to his cabin; locking himself in, he
lay down on the sofa.  The gloom of his great sorrow was heavy on
him; the reaction from the excitement of the morning had come.

He was recalled to himself by a gentle tapping.  Unlocking and
opening the door he saw Mr. Stonehouse, who said with trouble in his
voice:

'I came to you on account of my little child.'  There he stopped with
a break in his voice.  Harold, with intent to set his mind at ease
and to stave off further expressions of gratitude, replied:

'Oh, pray don't say anything.  I am only too glad that I was
privileged to be of service.  I only trust that the dear little girl
is no worse for her--her adventure!'

'That is why I am here,' said the father quickly.  'My wife and I are
loth to trouble you.  But the poor little thing has worked herself
into a paroxysm of fright and is calling for you.  We have tried in
vain to comfort or reassure her.  She will not be satisfied without
you.  She keeps calling on ""The Man"" to come and help her.  I am loth
to put you to further strain after all you have gone through to-day;
but if you would come--'  Harold was already in the passage as he
spoke:

'Of course I'm coming.  If I can in any way help it is both a
pleasure and a duty to be with her.'  Turning to the father he added:

'She is indeed a very sweet and good child.  I shall never forget how
she bore herself whilst we waited for aid to come.'

'You must tell her mother and me all about it,' said the father; much
moved.

When they came close to the Stonehouses' suite of rooms they heard
Pearl's voice rising with a pitiful note of fear:

'Where is The Man?  Oh! where is The Man?  Why doesn't he come to me?
He can save me!  I want to be with The Man!'  When the door opened
and she saw him she gave shriek of delight, and springing from the
arms of her mother fairly leaped into Harold's arms which were
outstretched to receive her.  She clung to him and kissed him again
and again, rubbing her little hands all over his face as though to
prove to herself that he was real and not a dream.  Then with a sigh
she laid her head on his breast, the reaction of sleep coming all at
once to her.  With a gesture of silence Harold sat down, holding the
child in his arms.  Her mother laid a thick shawl over and sat down
close to Harold.  Mr. Stonehouse stood quiet in the doorway with the
child's nurse peering anxiously over his shoulder.

After a little while, when he thought she was asleep, Harold rose and
began to place her gently in the bunk.  But the moment he did so she
waked with a scream.  The fright in her eyes was terrible.  She clung
to him, moaning and crying out between her sobs:

'Don't leave me!  Don't leave me!  Don't leave me!'  Harold was much
moved and held the little thing tight in his strong arms, saying to
her:

'No darling!  I shan't leave you!  Look in my eyes, dear, and I will
promise you, and then you will be happy.  Won't you?'

She looked quickly up in his face.  Then she kissed him lovingly, and
rested her head, but not sleepily this time, on his breast said:

'Yes!  I'm not afraid now!  I'm going to stay with The Man!'
Presently Mrs. Stonehouse, who had been thinking of ways and means,
and of the comfort of the strange man who had been so good to her
child, said:

'You will sleep with mother to-night, darling.  Mr. . . . The Man,'
she said this with an appealing look of apology to Harold, 'The Man
will stay by you till you are asleep . . . '  But she interrupted,
not fretfully or argumentatively, but with a settled air of content:

'No!  I'm going to sleep with The Man!'

'But, dear one,' the mother expostulated, 'The Man will want sleep
too.'

'All right, mother.  He can sleep too.  I'll be very good and lie
quite quiet; but oh! mother, I can't sleep unless his arms are round
me.  I'm afraid if they're not the sea will get me!' and she clung
closer to Harold, tightening her arms round his neck.

'You will not mind?' asked Mrs. Stonehouse timidly to Harold; and,
seeing acquiescence in his face, added in a burst of tearful
gratitude:

'Oh! you are good to her to us all!'

'Hush!' Harold said quietly.  Then he said to Pearl, in a cheerful
matter-of-fact way which carried conviction to the child's mind:

'Now, darling, it is time for all good little girls to be asleep,
especially when they have had an--an interesting day.  You wait here
till I put my pyjamas on, and then I'll come back for you.  And
mother and father shall come and see you nicely tucked in!'

'Don't be long!' the child anxiously called after him as he hurried
away.  Even trust can have its doubts.

In a few minutes Harold was back, in pyjamas and slipper and a
dressing-gown.  Pearl, already wrapped in a warm shawl by her mother,
held out her arms to Harold, who lifted her.

The Stonehouses' suite of rooms was close to the top of the
companion-way, and as Harold's stateroom was on the saloon deck, the
little procession had, much to the man's concern, run the gauntlet of
the thong of passengers whom the bad weather had kept indoors.  When
he came out of the day cabin carrying the child there was a rush of
all the women to make much of the little girl.  They were all very
kind and no troublesome; their interest was natural enough, and
Harold stopped whilst they petted the little thing.

The little procession followed.  Mr. and Mrs. Stonehouse coming next,
and last the nurse, who manifested a phase of the anxiety of a hen
who sees her foster ducklings waddling toward a pond.

When Harold was in his bunk the little maid was brought in.

When they had all gone and the cabin was dark, save for the gleam
from the nightlight which the careful mother had placed out of sight
in the basin at the foot of the bunk, Harold lay a long time in a
negative state, if such be possible, in so far as thought was
concerned.

Presently he became conscious of a movement of the child his arms; a
shuddering movement, and a sort of smothered groan.  The little thing
was living over again in sleep the perils and fears of the day.
Instinctively she put up her hands and felt the a round her.  Then
with a sigh clasped her arms round his neck, and with a peaceful look
laid her head upon his breast.  Even through the gates of sleep her
instinct had recognised and realised protection.

And then this trust of a little child brought back the man to his
nobler self.  Once again came back to him that love which he had had,
and which he knew now that he had never lost, for the little child
that he had seen grow into full womanhood; whose image must dwell in
his heart of hearts for evermore.

The long night's sleep quite restored Pearl.  She woke fairly early
and without any recurrence of fear.  At first she lay still, fearing
she would wake The Man, but finding that he was awake--he had not
slept a wink all night--she kissed him and then scrambled out of bed.

It was still early morning, but early hours rule on shipland.  Harold
rang for the steward, and when the man came he told him to tell Mr.
Stonehouse that the child was awake.  His delight when he found the
child unfrightened looking out of the port was unbounded.



CHAPTER XXVI--A NOBLE OFFER



That day Harold passed in unutterable gloom.  The reaction was strong
on him; and all his woe, his bitter remembrance of the past and his
desolation for the future, were with him unceasingly.

In the dusk of the evening he wandered out to his favourite spot, the
cable-tank on top of the aft wheelhouse.  Here he had been all alone,
and his loneliness had the added advantage that from the isolated
elevation he could see if anyone approached.  He had been out there
during the day, and the Captain, who had noticed his habit had had
rigged up a canvas dodger on the rail on the weather side.  When he
sat down on the coiled hawsers in the tank he was both secluded and
sheltered.  In this peaceful corner his thoughts ran freely and in
sympathy with the turmoil of wind and wave.

How unfair it all was!  Why had he been singled out for such misery?
What gleam of hope or comfort was left to his miserable life since he
had heard the words of Stephen; those dreadful words which had
shattered in an instant all the cherished hopes of his life.  Too
well he remembered the tone and look of scorn with which the horrible
truths had been conveyed to him.  In his inmost soul he accepted them
as truths; Stephen's soul had framed them and Stephen's lips had sent
them forth.

From his position behind the screen he did not see the approaching
figure of Mr. Stonehouse, and was astonished when he saw his head
rise above the edge of the tank as he climbed the straight Jacob's
ladder behind the wheelhouse.  The elder man paused as he saw him and
said in an apologetic way:

'Will you forgive my intruding on your privacy?  I wanted to speak to
you alone; and as I saw you come here a while ago I thought it would
be a good opportunity.'  Harold was rising as he spoke.

'By all means.  This place is common property.  But all the same I am
honoured in your seeking me.'  The poor fellow wished to be genial;
but despite his efforts there was a strange formality in the
expression of his words.  The elder man understood, and said as he
hurried forward and sank beside him:

'Pray don't stir!  Why, what a cosy corner this is.  I don't believe
at this moment there is such peace in the ship!'

Once again the bitterness of Harold's heart broke out in sudden
words:

'I hope not!  There is no soul on board to whom I could wish such
evil!'  The old man said as he laid his hand softly on the other's
shoulder:

'God help you, my poor boy, if such pain is in your heart!'  Mr.
Stonehouse looked out at the sea, at last turning his face to him
again he spoke:

'If you feel that I intrude on you I earnestly ask you to forgive me;
but I think that the years between your age and mine as well as my
feeling towards the great obligation which I owe you will plead for
excuse.  There is something I would like to say to you, sir; but I
suppose I must not without your permission.  May I have it?'

'If you wish, sir.  I can at least hear it.'

The old man bowed and went on:

'I could not but notice that you have some great grief bearing upon
you; and from one thing or another--I can tell you the data if you
wish me to do so--I have come to the conclusion that you are leaving
your native land because of it.'  Here Harold, wakened to amazement
by the readiness with which his secret had been divined, said
quickly, rather as an exclamation than interrogation:

'How on earth did you know that!'  His companion, taking it as a
query, answered:

'Sir, at your age and with your strength life should be a joy; and
yet you are sad:  Companionship should be a pleasure; yet you prefer
solitude.  That you are brave and unselfish I know; I have reason,
thank God! to know it.  That you are kindly and tolerant is apparent
from your bearing to my little child this morning; as well as your
goodness of last night, the remembrance of which her mother and I
will bear to our graves; and to me now.  I have not lived all these
years without having had trouble in my own heart; and although the
happiness of late years has made it dim, my gratitude to you who are
so sad brings it all back to me.'  He bowed, and Harold, wishing to
avoid speaking of his sorrow, said:

'You are quite right so far as I have a sorrow; and it is because of
it I have turned my back on home.  Let it rest at that!'  His
companion bowed gravely and went on.

'I take it that you are going to begin life afresh in the new
country.  In such case I have a proposition to make.  I have a large
business; a business so large that I am unable to manage it all
myself.  I was intending that when I arrived at home I would set
about finding a partner.  The man I want is not an ordinary man.  He
must have brains and strength and daring.'  He paused.  Harold felt
what was coming, but realised, as he jumped at the conclusion, that
it would not do for him to take for granted that he was the man
sought.  He waited; Mr. Stonehouse went on:

'As to brains, I am prepared to take the existence of such on my own
judgment.  I have been reading men, and in this aspect specially, all
my life.  The man I have thought of has brains.  I am satisfied of
that, without proof.  I have proof of the other qualities.'  He
paused again; as Harold said nothing he continued in a manner ill at
ease:

'My difficulty is to make the proposal to the man I want.  It is so
difficult to talk business to a man to whom you under great
obligation; to whom you owe everything.  He might take a friendly
overture ill.'  There was but one thing to be said and Harold said
it.  His heart warmed to the kindly old man and he wished to spare
him pain; even if he could not accept him proposition:

'He couldn't take it ill; unless he was an awful bounder.'

'It was you I thought of!'

'I thought so much, sir;' said Harold after a pause, 'and I thank you
earnestly and honestly.  But it is impossible.'

'Oh, my dear sir!' said the other, chagrined as well as surprised.
'Think again!  It is really worth your while to think of it, no
matter what your ultimate decision may be!'

Harold shook his head.  There was a long silence.  The old man wished
to give his companion time to think; and indeed he thought that
Harold was weighing the proposition in his mind.  As for Harold, he
was thinking how best he could make his absolute refusal inoffensive.
He must, he felt, give some reason; and his thoughts were bent on how
much of the truth he could safely give without endangering his
secret.  Therefore he spoke at last in general terms:

'I can only ask you, sir, to bear with me and to believe that I am
very truly and sincerely grateful to you for your trust.  But the
fact is, I cannot go anywhere amongst people.  Of course you
understand that I am speaking in confidence; to you alone and to none
other?'

'Absolutely!' said Mr. Stonehouse gravely.  Harold went on:

'I must be alone.  I can only bear to see people on this ship because
it is a necessary way to solitude.'

'You ""cannot go anywhere amongst people""!  Pardon me.  I don't wish
to be unduly inquisitive; but on my word I fail to understand!'
Harold was in a great difficulty.  Common courtesy alone forbade that
he should leave the matter where it was; and in addition both the
magnificently generous offer which had been made to him, and the way
in which accident had thrown him to such close intimacy with Pearl's
family, required that he should be at least fairly frank.  At last in
a sort of cold desperation he said:

'I cannot meet anyone . . . There it something that happened . . .
Something I did . . . Nothing can make it right . . . All I can do is
to lose myself in the wildest, grimmest, wilderness in the world; and
fight my pain . . . my shame . . . !'

A long silence.  Then the old man's voice came clear and sweet,
something like music, in the shelter from the storm:

'But perhaps time may mend things.  God is very good . . . !'  Harold
answered out of the bitterness of his heart.  He felt that his words
were laden with an anger which he did not feel, but he did not see
his way to alter them:

'Nothing can mend this thing!  It is at the farthest point of evil;
and there is no going on or coming back.  Nothing can wipe out what
is done; what is past!'

Again silence, and again the strong, gentle voice:

'God can do much!  Oh my dear young friend, you who have been such a
friend to me and mine, think of this.'

'God Himself can do nothing here!  It is done!  And that is the end!'
He turned his head; it was all he could do to keep from groaning.
The old man's voice vibrated with earnest conviction as he spoke:

'You are young and strong and brave!  Your heart is noble!  You can
think quickly in moments of peril; therefore your brain is sound and
alert.  Now, may I ask you a favour? it is not much.  Only that you
will listen, without interruption, to what, if I have your
permission, I am going to say.  Do not ask me anything; do not deny;
do not interrupt!  Only listen!  May I ask this?'

'By all means!  It is not much!' he almost felt like smiling as he
spoke.  Mr. Stonehouse, after a short pause, as if arranging his
thoughts, spoke:

'Let me tell you what I am.  I began life with nothing but a fair
education such as all our American boys get.  But from a good mother
I got an idea that to be honest was the best of all things; from a
strenuous father, who, however, could not do well for himself, I
learned application to work and how best to use and exercise such
powers as were in me.  From the start things prospered with me.  Men
who knew me trusted me; some came with offers to share in my
enterprise.  Thus I had command of what capital I could use; I was
able to undertake great works and to carry them through.  Fortune
kept growing and growing; for as I got wealthier I found newer and
larger and more productive uses for my money.  And in all my work I
can say before God I never willingly wronged any man.  I am proud to
be able to say that my name stands good wherever it has been used.
It may seem egotistical that I say such things of myself.  It may
seem bad taste; but I speak because I have a motive in so doing.  I
want you to understand at the outset that in my own country, wherever
I am known and in my own work, my name is a strength.'

He paused a while.  Harold sat still; he knew that such man would
not, could not, speak in such a way without a strong motive; and to
learn that motive he waited.

'When you were in the water making what headway you could in that
awful sea--when my little child's life hung in the balance, and the
anguish of my wife's heart nearly tore my heart in two, I said to
myself, ""If we had a son I should wish him to be like that.""  I meant
it then, and I mean it now!  Come to me as you are!  Faults, and
past, and all.  Forget the past!  Whatever it was we will together
try to wipe it out.  Much may be done in restoring where there has
been any wrong-doing.  Take my name as your own.  It will protect you
from the result of what ever has been, and give you an opportunity to
find your place again.  You are not bad in heart I know.  Whatever
you have done has not been from base motives.  Few of us are spotless
as to facts.  You and I will show ourselves--for unless God wills to
the opposite we shall confide in none other--that a strong, brave man
may win back all that was lost.  Let me call you by my name and hold
you as the son of my heart; and it will be a joy and pleasure to my
declining years.'

As he had spoken, Harold's thought's had at first followed in some
wonderment.  But gradually, as his noble purpose unfolded, based as
it was on a misconception as to the misdoing of which he himself had
spoken, he had been almost stricken dumb.  At the first realisation
of what was intended he could not have spoken had he tried; but at
the end he had regained his thoughts and his voice.  There was still
wonderment in it, as realising from the long pause that the old man
had completed his suggestion, he spoke:

'If I understand aright you are offering me your name!  Offering to
share your honour with me.  With me, whom, if again I understand, you
take as having committed some crime?'

'I inferred from what you said and from your sadness, your desire to
shun your kind, that there was, if not a crime, some fault which
needed expiation.'

'But your honour, sir; your honour!'  There was a proud look in the
old man's eyes as he said quietly:

'It was my desire, is my desire, to share with you what I have that
is best; and that, I take it, is not the least valuable of my
possessions, such as they are!  And why not?  You have given to me
all that makes life sweet; without which it would be unbearable.
That child who came to my wife and me when I was old and she had
passed her youth is all in all to us both.  Had your strength and
courage been for barter in the moments when my child was quivering
between life and death, I would have cheerfully purchased them with
not half but all!  Sir, I should have given my soul!  I can say this
now, for gratitude is above all barter; and surely it is allowed to a
father to show gratitude for the life of his child!'

This great-hearted generosity touched Harold to the quick.  He could
hardly speak for a few minutes.  Then instinctively grasping the old
man's hand he said:

'You overwhelm me.  Such noble trust and generosity as you have shown
me demands a return of trust.  But I must think!  Will you remain
here and let me return to you in a little while?'

He rose quickly and slipped down the iron ladder, passing into the
darkness and the mist and the flying spray.



CHAPTER XXVII--AGE'S WISDOM



Harold went to and fro on the deserted deck.  All at once the course
he had to pursue opened out before him.  He was aware that what the
noble-minded old man offered him was fortune, great fortune in any
part of the world.  He would have to be refused, but the refusal
should be gently done.  He, believing that the other had done
something very wrong, had still offered to share with him his name,
his honour.  Such confidence demanded full confidence in return; the
unwritten laws which governed the men amongst whom he had been
brought up required it.

And the shape that confidence should take?  He must first disabuse
his new friend's mind of criminal or unworthy cause for his going
away.  For the sake of his own name and that of his dead father that
should be done.  Then he would have to suggest the real cause . . .
He would in this have to trust Mr. Stonehouse's honour for secrecy.
But he was worthy of trust.  He would, of course, give no name, no
clue; but he would put things generally in a way that he could
understand.

When his mind was so far made up he wanted to finish the matter, so
he turned to the wheelhouse and climbed the ladder again.  It was not
till he sat in the shelter by his companion that he became aware that
he had become wet with the spray.  The old man wishing to help him in
his embarrassment said:

'Well?' Harold began at once; the straightforward habit of his life
stood to him now:

'Let me say first, sir, what will I know give you pleasure.'  The old
man extended his hand; he had been hoping for acceptance, and this
seemed like it.  Harold laid his hand on it for an instant only, and
then raised it as if to say 'Wait':

'You have been so good to me, so nobly generous in your wishes that I
feel I owe you a certain confidence.  But as it concerns not myself
alone I will ask that it be kept a secret between us two.  Not to be
told to any other; not even your wife!'

'I will hold your secret sacred.  Even from my wife; the first secret
I shall have ever kept from her.'

'First, then, let me say, and this is what I know will rejoice you,
that I am not leaving home and country because of any crime I have
committed; not from any offence against God or man, or law.  Thank
God! I am free from such.  I have always tried to live uprightly . .
. '  Here a burst of pain overcame him, and with a dry sob he added:
'And that is what makes the terrible unfairness of it all!'

The old man laid a kindly hand on his shoulder and kept it there for
a few moments.

'My poor boy!  My poor boy!' was all he said.  Harold shook himself
as if to dislodge the bitter thoughts.  Mastering himself he went on:

'There was a lady with whom I was very much thrown in contact since
we were children.  Her father was my father's friend.  My friend too,
God knows; for almost with his dying breath he gave sanction to my
marrying his daughter, if it should ever be that she should care for
me in that way.  But he wished me to wait, and, till she was old
enough to choose, to leave her free.  For she is several years
younger than I am; and I am not very old yet--except in heart!  All
this, you understand, was said in private to me; none other knew it.
None knew of it even till this moment when I tell you that such a
thing has been.'  He paused; the other said:

'Believe me that I value your confidence, beyond all words!'  Harold
felt already the good effects of being able to speak of his pent-up
trouble.  Already this freedom from the nightmare loneliness of his
own thoughts seemed to be freeing his very soul.

'I honestly kept to his wishes.  Before God, I did!  No man who loved
a woman, honoured her, worshipped her, could have been more
scrupulously careful as to leaving her free.  What it was to me to so
hold myself no one knows; no one ever will know.  For I loved her, do
love her, with every nerve and fibre of my heart.  All our lives we
had been friends; and I believed we loved and trusted each other.
But . . . but then there came a day when I found by chance that a
great trouble threatened her.  Not from anything wrong that she had
done; but from something perhaps foolish, harmlessly foolish except
that she did not know . . . '  He stopped suddenly, fearing he might
have said overmuch of Stephen's side of the affair.  'When I came to
her aid, however, meaning the best, and as single-minded as a man can
be, she misunderstood my words, my meaning, my very coming; and she
said things which cannot be unsaid.  Things . . . matters were so
fixed that I could not explain; and I had to listen.  She said things
that I did not believe she could have said to me, to anyone.  Things
that I did not think she could have thought . . . I dare say she was
right in some ways.  I suppose I bungled in my desire to be
unselfish.  What she said came to me in new lights upon what I had
done . . . But anyhow her statements were such that I felt I could
not, should not, remain.  My very presence must have been a trouble
to her hereafter.  There was nothing for it but to come away.  There
was no place for me!  No hope for me!  There is none on this side of
the grave! . . . For I love her still, more than ever.  I honour and
worship her still, and ever will, and ever must! . . . I am content
to forego my own happiness; but I feel there is a danger to her from
what has been.  That there is and must be to her unhappiness even
from the fact that it was I who was the object of her wrath; and this
adds to my woe.  Worst of all is . . . the thought and the memory
that she should have done so; she who . . . she . . . '

He turned away overcome and hid his face in his hands.  The old man
sat still; he knew that at such a moment silence is the best form of
sympathy.  But his heart glowed; the wisdom of his years told him
that he had heard as yet of no absolute bar to his friend's ultimate
happiness.

'I am rejoiced, my dear boy, at what you tell me of your own conduct.
It would have made no difference to me had it been otherwise.  But it
would have meant a harder and longer climb back to the place you
should hold.  But it really seems that nothing is so hopeless as you
think.  Believe me, my dear young friend who are now as a son to my
heart, that there will be bright days for you yet . . . '  He paused
a moment, but mastering himself went on in a quiet voice:

'I think you are wise to go away.  In the solitudes and in danger
things that are little in reality will find their true perspective;
and things that are worthy will appear in their constant majesty.'

He stood, and laying once again his hand on the young man's shoulder
said:

'I recognise that I--that we, for my wife and little girl would be at
one with me in my wish, did they know of it, must not keep you from
your purpose of fighting out your trouble alone.  Every man, as the
Scotch proverb says, must ""dree his own weird.""  I shall not, I must
not, ask you for any promise; but I trust that if ever you do come
back you will make us all glad by seeing you.  And remember that what
I said of myself and of all I have--all--holds good so long as I
shall live!'

Before Harold could reply he had slipped down the ladder and was
gone.

During the rest of the voyage, with the exception of one occasion, he
did not allude to the subject again by word or implication, and
Harold was grateful to him for it.

On the night before Fire Island should be sighted Harold was in the
bow of the great ship looking out with eyes in which gleamed no hope.
To him came through the darkness Mr. Stonehouse.  He heard the
footsteps and knew them; so with the instinct of courtesy, knowing
that his friend would not intrude on his solitude without purpose, he
turned and met him.  When the American stood beside him he said,
studiously avoiding looking at his companion:

'This is the last night we shall be together, and, if I may, there is
one thing I would like to say to you.'

'Say all you like, sir,' said Harold as heartily as he could, 'I am
sure it is well meant; and for that at any rate I shall be grateful
to you.'

'You will yet be grateful, I think!' he answered gravely.  'When it
comes back to you in loneliness and solitude you will, I believe,
think it worth being grateful for.  I don't mean that you will be
grateful to me, but for the thing itself.  I speak out of the wisdom
of many years.  At your time of life the knowledge cannot come from
observation.  It may my poor boy, come through pain; and if what I
think is correct you will even in due time be grateful to the pain
which left such golden residuum.'  He paused, and Harold grew
interested.  There was something in the old man's manner which
presaged a truth; he, at least, believed it.  So the young man
listened at first with his ears; and as the other spoke, his heart
listened too:

'Young men are apt to think somewhat wrongly of women they love and
respect.  We are apt to think that such women are of a different clay
from ourselves.  Nay! that they are not compact of clay at all, but
of some faultless, flawless material which the Almighty keeps for
such fine work.  It is only in middle age that men--except scamps,
who learn this bad side of knowledge young--realise that women are
human beings like themselves.  It may be, you know, that you may have
misjudged this young lady!  That you have not made sufficient
allowance for her youth, her nature, even the circumstances under
which she spoke.  You have told me that she was in some deep grief or
trouble.  May it not have been that this in itself unnerved her,
distorted her views, aroused her passion till all within and around
was tinged with the jaundice of her concern, her humiliation--
whatever it was that destroyed for the time that normal self which
you had known so long.  May it not have been that her bitterest
memory even since may be of the speaking of these very words which
sent you out into the wide world to hide yourself from men.  I have
thought, waking and sleeping, of your position ever since you
honoured me with your confidence; and with every hour the conviction
has strengthened in me that there is a way out of this situation
which sends a man like you into solitude with a heart hopeless and
full of pain; and which leaves her perhaps in greater pain, for she
has not like you the complete sense of innocence.  But at present
there is no way out but through time and thought.  Whatever may be
her ideas or wishes she is powerless.  She does not know your
thoughts, no matter how she may guess at them.  She does not know
where you are or how to reach you, no matter how complete her
penitence may be.  And oh! my dear young friend, remember that you
are a strong man, and she is a woman.  Only a woman in her passion
and her weakness after all.  Think this all over, my poor boy!  You
will have time and opportunity where you are going.  God help you to
judge wisely!'  After a pause of a few seconds he said abruptly:
'Good night!' and moved quickly away.


When the time for parting came Pearl was inconsolable.  Not knowing
any reason why The Man should not do as she wished she was persistent
in her petitions to Harold that he should come with her, and to her
father and mother that they should induce him to do so.  Mrs.
Stonehouse would have wished him to join them if only for a time.
Her husband, unable to give any hint without betraying confidence,
had to content himself with trying to appease his little daughter by
vague hopes rather than promises that her friend would join them at
some other time.

When the Scoriac was warped at the pier there was a tendency on the
part of the passengers to give Harold a sort of public send-off; but
becoming aware of it he hurried down the gangway without waiting.
Having only hand luggage, for he was to get his equipment in New
York, he had cleared and passed the ring of customs officers before
the most expeditious of the other passengers had collected their
baggage.  He had said good-bye to the Stonehouses in their own cabin.
Pearl had been so much affected at saying good-bye, and his heart had
so warmed to her, that at last he had said impulsively:

'Don't cry, darling.  If I am spared I shall come back to you within
three years.  Perhaps I will write before then; but there are not
many post-offices where I am going to!'

Children are easily satisfied.  Their trust makes a promise a real
thing; and its acceptance is the beginning of satisfaction.  But for
weeks after the parting she had often fits of deep depression, and at
such times her tears always flowed.  She took note of the date, and
there was never a day that she did not think of and sigh for The Man.

And The Man, away in the wilds of Alaska, was feeling, day by day and
hour by hour, the chastening and purifying influences of the
wilderness.  Hot passions cooled before the breath of the snowfield
and the glacier.  The moaning of a tortured spirit was lost in the
roar of the avalanche and the scream of the cyclone.  Pale sorrow and
cold despair were warmed and quickened by the fierce sunlight which
came suddenly and stayed only long enough to vitalise all nature.

And as the first step to understanding, The Man forgot himself.



CHAPTER XXVIII--DE LANNOY



Two years!

Not much to look back upon, but a world to look forward to.  To
Stephen, dowered though she was with rare personal gifts and with
wealth and position accorded to but few, the hours of waiting were
longer than the years that were past.  Yet the time had new and
startling incidents for her.  Towards Christmas in the second year
the Boer war had reached its climax of evil.  As the news of disaster
after disaster was flashed through the cable she like others felt
appalled at the sacrifices that were being exacted by the God of War.

One day she casually read in The Times that the Earl de Lannoy had
died in his London mansion, and further learned that he had never
recovered from the shock of hearing that his two sons and his nephew
had been killed.  The paragraph concluded:  ""By his death the title
passes to a distant relative.  The new Lord de Lannoy is at present
in India with his regiment, the 35th or 'Grey' Hussars, of which he
is Colonel.""  She gave the matter a more than passing thought, for it
was sad to find a whole family thus wiped out at a blow.

Early in February she received a telegram from her London solicitor
saying that he wished to see her on an important matter.  Her answer
was:  ""Come at once""; and at tea-time Mr. Copleston arrived.  He was
an old friend and she greeted him warmly.  She was a little chilled
when he answered with what seemed unusual deference:

'I thank your Ladyship for your kindness!'  She raised her eyebrows
but made no comment:  she was learning to be silent under surprise.
When she had handed the old gentleman his tea she said:

'My aunt has chosen to remain away, thinking that you might wish to
see me privately.  But I take it that there is nothing which she may
not share.  I have no secrets from her.'

He rubbed his hands genially as he replied:

'Not at all; not at all!  I should like her to be present.  It will,
I am sure, be a delight to us all.'

Again raised eyebrows; again silence on the subject.  When a servant
answered her bell she told him to ask Miss Rowly if she would kindly
join them.

Aunt Laetitia and the solicitor were old cronies, and their greeting
was most friendly.  When the old gentlewoman had seated herself and
taken her cup of tea, Mr. Copleston said to Stephen, with a sort of
pomposity:

'I have to announce your succession to the Earldom de Lannoy!'

Stephen sat quite still.  She knew the news was true; Mr. Copleston
was not one who would jest on a business subject, and too accurate a
lawyer to make an error in a matter of fact.  But the fact did not
seem to touch her.  It was not that she was indifferent to it; few
women could hear such news without a thrill.  Mr. Copleston seemed at
a loss.  Miss Rowly rose and quietly kissed her, and saying simply,
'God bless you, my dear!' went back to her seat.

Realising that Mr. Copleston expected some acknowledgment, Stephen
held out her hand to him and said quietly:

'Thank you!'

After a long pause she added quietly:

'Now, won't you tell us about it?  I am in absolute ignorance; and
don't understand.'

'I had better not burden you, at first, with too many details, which
can come later; but give you a rough survey of the situation.'

'Your title of Countess de Lannoy comes to you through your ancestor
Isobel, third and youngest daughter of the sixth Earl; Messrs
Collinbrae and Jackson, knowing that my firm acted for your family,
communicated with us.  Lest there should be any error we followed
most carefully every descendant and every branch of the family, for
we thought it best not to communicate with you till your right of
inheritance was beyond dispute.  We arrived independently at the same
result as Messrs. Collinbrae and Jackson.  There is absolutely no
doubt whatever of your claim.  You will petition the Crown, and on
reference to the House of Lords the Committee for Privileges will
admit your right.  May I offer my congratulations, Lady de Lannoy on
your acquisition?  By the way, I may say that all the estates of the
Earldom, which have been from the first kept in strict entail, go
with the title de Lannoy.'

During the recital Stephen was conscious of a sort of bitter comment
on the tendencies of good fortune.

'Too late! too late!' something seemed to whisper, 'what delight it
would have been had Father inherited . . . If Harold had not gone . .
. !'  All the natural joy seemed to vanish, as bubbles break into
empty air.

To Aunt Laetitia the new title was a source of pride and joy, far
greater than would have been the case had it come to herself.  She
had for so many years longed for new honours for Stephen that she had
almost come to regard them as a right whose coming should not be too
long delayed.  Miss Rowly had never been to Lannoy; and, indeed, she
knew personally nothing of the county Angleshire in which it was
situated.  She was naturally anxious to see the new domain; but kept
her feeling concealed during the months that elapsed until Stephen's
right had been conceded by the Committee for Privileges.  But after
that her impatience became manifest to Stephen, who said one day in a
teasing, caressing way, as was sometimes her wont:

'Why, Auntie, what a hurry you are in!  Lannoy will keep, won't it?'

'Oh, my dear,' she replied, shaking her head, 'I can understand your
own reticence, for you don't want to seem greedy and in a hurry about
your new possessions.  But when people come to my age there's no time
to waste.  I feel I would not have complete material for happiness in
the World-to-come, if there were not a remembrance of my darling in
her new home!'

Stephen was much touched; she said impulsively:

'We shall go to-morrow, Auntie.  No!  Let us go to-day.  You shall
not wait an hour that I can help!'  She ran to the bell; but before
her hand was on the cord the other said:

'Not yet!  Stephen dear.  It would flurry me to start all at once;
to-morrow will be time enough.  And that will give you time to send
word so that they will be prepared for your coming.'

How often do we look for that to-morrow which never comes?  How often
do we find that its looked-for rosy tints are none other than the
gloom-laden grey of the present?

Before the morrow's sun was high in the heavens Stephen was hurriedly
summoned to her aunt's bedside.  She lay calm and peaceful; but one
side of her face was alive and the other seemingly dead.  In the
night a paralytic stroke had seized her.  The doctors said she might
in time recover a little, but she would never be her old active self
again.  She herself, with much painful effort, managed to convey to
Stephen that she knew the end was near.  Stephen, knowing the wish of
her heart and thinking that it might do her good to gratify her wish,
asked if she should arrange that she be brought to Lannoy.  Feebly
and slowly, word by word, she managed to convey her idea.

'Not now, dear one.  I shall see it all in time!--Soon!  And I shall
understand and rejoice!'  For a long time she lay still, holding with
her right hand, which was not paralysed, the other's hand.  Then she
murmured:

'You will find happiness there!'  She said no more; but seemed to
sleep.

From that sleep she never woke, but faded slowly, softly away.

Stephen was broken-hearted.  Now, indeed, she felt alone and
desolate.  All were gone.  Father, uncle, aunt!--And  Harold.  The
kingdoms of the Earth which lay at her feet were of no account.  One
hour of the dead or departed, any of them, back again were worth them
all!

Normanstand was now too utterly lonely to be endurable; so Stephen
determined to go, for a time at any rate, to Lannoy.  She was
becoming accustomed to be called 'my lady' and 'your ladyship,' and
the new loneness made her feel better prepared to take her place
amongst new surroundings.

In addition, there was another spur to her going.  Leonard Everard,
knowing of her absolute loneliness, and feeling that in it was a
possibility of renewing his old status, was beginning to make himself
apparent.  He had learned by experience a certain wisdom, and did not
put himself forward obtrusively.  But whenever they met he looked at
her so meekly and so lovingly that it brought remembrances which came
with blushes.  So, all at once, without giving time for the news to
permeate through the neighbourhood, she took her way to Lannoy with a
few servants.

Stephen's life had hitherto been spent inland.  She had of course now
and again been for short periods to various places; but the wonder of
the sea as a constant companion had been practically unknown to her.

Now at her new home its full splendour burst upon her; and so
impressed itself upon her that new life seemed to open.

Lannoy was on the north-eastern coast, the castle standing at the
base of a wide promontory stretching far into the North Sea.  From
the coast the land sloped upward to a great rolling ridge.  The
outlook seaward was over a mighty expanse of green sward, dotted here
and there with woods and isolated clumps of trees which grew fewer
and smaller as the rigour of the northern sea was borne upon them by
the easterly gales.

The coast was a wild and lonely one.  No habitation other than an
isolated fisher's cottage was to be seen between the little fishing-
port at the northern curve away to the south, where beyond a waste of
sandhills and strand another tiny fishing-village nestled under a
high cliff, sheltering it from northerly wind.  For centuries the
lords of Lannoy had kept their magnificent prospect to themselves;
and though they had treated their farmers and cottagers well, none
had ever been allowed to settle in the great park to seaward of the
castle.

From the terrace of the castle only than one building, other than the
cottage on the headland, could be seen.  Far off on the very crest of
the ridge was the tower of an old windmill.



CHAPTER XXIX--THE SILVER LADY



When it was known that Lady de Lannoy had come to Lannoy there was a
prompt rush of such callers as the county afforded.  Stephen,
however, did not wish to see anyone just at present.  Partly to avoid
the chance meeting with strangers, and partly because she enjoyed and
benefited by the exercise, she was much away from home every day.
Sometimes, attended only by a groom, she rode long distances north or
south along the coast; or up over the ridge behind the castle and far
inland along the shaded roads through the woods; or over bleak wind-
swept stretches of moorland.  Sometimes she would walk, all alone,
far down to the sea-road, and would sit for hours on the shore or
high up on some little rocky headland where she could enjoy the
luxury of solitude.

Now and again in her journeyings she made friends, most of them
humble ones.  She was so great a lady in her station that she could
be familiar without seeming to condescend.  The fishermen of the
little ports to north and south came to know her, and to look gladly
for her coming.  Their goodwives had for her always a willing curtsy
and a ready smile.  As for the children, they looked on her with
admiration and love, tempered with awe.  She was so gentle with them,
so ready to share their pleasures and interests, that after a while
they came to regard her as some strange embodiment of Fairydom and
Dreamland.  Many a little heart was made glad by the arrival of some
item of delight from the Castle; and the hearts of the sick seemed
never to hope, or their eyes to look, in vain.

One friend she made who became very dear and of great import.  Often
she had looked up at the old windmill on the crest of the ridge and
wondered who inhabited it; for that some one lived in it, or close
by, was shown at times by the drifting smoke.  One day she made up
her mind to go and see for herself.  She had a fancy not to ask
anyone about it.  The place was a little item of mystery; and as such
to be treasured and exploited, and in due course explored.  The mill
itself was picturesque, and the detail at closer acquaintance
sustained the far-off impression.  The roadway forked on the near
side of the mill, reuniting again the further side, so that the place
made a sort of island--mill, out-offices and garden.  As the mill was
on the very top of the ridge the garden which lay seawards was
sheltered by the building from the west, and from the east by a thick
hedge of thorn and privet, which quite hid it from the roadway.
Stephen took the lower road.  Finding no entrance save a locked
wooden door she followed round to the western side, where the
business side of the mill had been.  It was all still now and silent,
and that it had long fallen into disuse was shown by the grey faded
look of everything.  Grass, green and luxuriant, grew untrodden
between the cobble-stones with which the yard was paved.  There was a
sort of old-world quietude about everything which greatly appealed to
Stephen.

Stephen dismounted and walked round the yard admiring everything.
She did not feel as if intruding; for the gateway was wide open.

A low door in the base of the mill tower opened, and a maid appeared,
a demure pretty little thing of sixteen or seventeen years, dressed
in a prim strait dress and an old-fashioned Puritan cap.  Seeing a
stranger, she made an ejaculation and drew back hastily.  Stephen
called out to her:

'Don't be afraid, little girl!  Will you kindly tell me who lives
here?'  The answer came with some hesitation:

'Sister Ruth.'

'And who is Sister Ruth?'  The question came instinctively and
without premeditation.  The maid, embarrassed, held hard to the half-
open door and shifted from foot to foot uneasily.

'I don't know!' she said at last.  'Only Sister Ruth, I suppose!'  It
was manifest that the matter had never afforded her anything in the
nature of a problem.  There was an embarrassing silence.  Stephen did
not wish to seem, or even to be, prying; but her curiosity was
aroused.  What manner of woman was this who lived so manifestly
alone, and who had but a Christian name!  Stephen, however, had all
her life been accustomed to dominance, and at Normanstand and Norwood
had made many acquaintances amongst her poorer neighbours.  She was
just about to ask if she might see Sister Ruth, when behind the maid
in the dark of the low passage-way appeared the tall, slim figure of
a silver woman.  Truly a silver woman!  The first flash of Stephen's
thought was correct.  White-haired, white-faced, white-capped, white-
kerchiefed; in a plain-cut dress of light-grey silk, without
adornment of any kind.  The whole ensemble was as a piece of old
silver.  The lines of her face were very dignified, very sweet, very
beautiful.  Stephen felt at once that she was in the presence of no
common woman.  She looked an admiration which all her Quaker garments
could not forbid the other to feel.  She was not the first to speak;
in such a noble presence the dignity of Stephen's youth imperatively
demanded silence, if not humility.  So she waited.  The Silver Lady,
for so Stephen ever after held her in her mind, said quietly, but
with manifest welcome:

'Didst thou wish to see me?  Wilt thou come in?'  Stephen answered
frankly:

'I should like to come in; if you will not think me rude.  The fact
is, I was struck when riding by with the beautiful situation of the
mill.  I thought it was only an old mill till I saw the garden
hedges; and I came round to ask if I might go in.'  The  Silver Lady
came forward at a pace that by itself expressed warmth as she said
heartily:

'Indeed thou mayest.  Stay! it is tea-time.  Let us put thy horse in
one of the sheds; there is no man here at present to do it.  Then
thou shalt come with me and see my beautiful view!'  She was about to
take the horse herself, but Stephen forestalled her with a quick:
'No, no! pray let me.  I am quite accustomed.'  She led the horse to
a shed, and having looped the rein over a hook, patted him and ran
back.  The Silver Lady gave her a hand, and they entered the dark
passage together.

Stephen was thinking if she ought to begin by telling her name.  But
the Haroun al Raschid feeling for adventure incognito is an innate
principle of the sons of men.  It was seldom indeed that her life had
afforded her such an opportunity.

The Silver Lady on her own part also wished for silence, as she
looked for the effect on her companion when the glory of the view
should break upon her.  When they had climbed the winding stone
stair, which led up some twenty feet, there was a low wide landing
with the remains of the main shaft of the mill machinery running
through it.  From one side rose a stone stair curving with the outer
wall of the mill tower and guarded by a heavy iron rail.  A dozen
steps there were, and then a landing a couple of yards square; then a
deep doorway cut in the thickness of the wall, round which the
winding stair continued.

The Silver Lady, who had led the way, threw open the door, and
motioned to her guest to enter.  Stephen stood for a few moments,
surprised as well as delighted, for the room before her as not like
anything which she had ever seen or thought of.

It was a section of almost the whole tower, and was of considerable
size, for the machinery and even the inner shaft had been removed.
East and south and west the wall had been partially cut away so that
great wide windows nearly the full height of the room showed the
magnificent panorama.  In the depths of the ample windows were little
cloistered nooks where one might with a feeling of super-solitude be
away from and above the world.

The room was beautifully furnished and everywhere were flowers, with
leaves and sprays and branches where possible.

Even from where she stood in the doorway Stephen had a bird's-eye
view of the whole countryside; not only of the coast, with which she
was already familiar, and on which her windows at the Castle looked,
but to the south and west, which the hill rising steep behind the
castle and to southward shut out.

The Silver Lady could not but notice her guest's genuine admiration.

'Thou likest my room and my view.  There is no use asking thee, I see
thou dost!'  Stephen answered with a little gasp.

'I think it is the quaintest and most beautiful place I have ever
seen!'

'I am so glad thou likest it.  I have lived here for nearly forty
years; and they have been years of unutterable peace and earthly
happiness!  And now, thou wilt have some tea!'

Stephen left the mill that afternoon with a warmth of heart that she
had been a stranger to for many a day.  The two women had accepted
each other simply.  'I am called Ruth,' said the Silver Lady.  'And I
am Stephen,' said the Countess de Lannoy in reply.  And that was all;
neither had any clue to the other's identity.  Stephen felt that some
story lay behind that calm, sweet personality; much sorrow goes to
the making of fearless quietude.  The Quaker lady moved so little out
of her own environment that she did not even suspect the identity of
her visitor.  All that she knew of change was a notice from the
solicitor to the estate that, as the headship had lapsed into another
branch of the possessing family, she must be prepared, if necessary,
to vacate her tenancy, which was one 'at will.'

It was not long before Stephen availed herself of the permission to
come again.  This time she made up her mind to tell who she was, lest
the concealment of her identity might lead to awkwardness.  At that
meeting friendship became union.

The natures of the two women expanded to each other; and after a very
few meetings there was established between them a rare confidence.
Even the personal austerity of Quakerdom, or the state and estate of
the peeress, could not come between.  Their friendship seemed to be
for the life of one.  To the other it would be a memory.

The Silver Lady never left the chosen routine of her own life.
Whatever was the reason of her giving up the world, she kept it to
herself; and Stephen respected her reticence as much as she did her
confidence.

It had become a habit, early in their friendship, for Stephen to ride
or walk over to the windmill in the dusk of the evening when she felt
especially lonely.  On one such occasion she pushed open the outer
door, which was never shut, and took her way up the stone stair.  She
knew she would find her friend seated in the window with hands folded
on lap, looking out into the silent dusk with that absorbed
understanding of things which is holier than reverence, and
spiritually more active than conscious prayer.

She tapped the door lightly, and stepped into the room.

With a glad exclamation, which coming through her habitual sedateness
showed how much she loved the young girl, Sister Ruth started to her
feet.  There was something of such truth in the note she had sounded,
that the lonely girl's heart went out to her in abandoned fulness.
She held out her arms; and, as she came close to the other, fell
rather than sank at her feet.  The elder woman recognised, and knew.
She made no effort to restrain her; but sinking back into her own
seat laid the girl's head in her lap, and held her hands close
against her breast.

'Tell me,' she whispered.  'Won't you tell me, dear child, what
troubles you?  Tell me! dear.  It may bring peace!'

'Oh, I am miserable, miserable, miserable!' moaned Stephen in a low
voice whose despair made the other's heart grow cold.  The Silver
Lady knew that here golden silence was the best of help; holding
close the other's hands, she waited.  Stephen's breast began to
heave; with an impulsive motion she drew away her hands and put them
before her burning face, which she pressed lower still on the other's
lap.  Sister Ruth knew that the trouble, whatever it was, was about
to find a voice.  And then came in a low shuddering whisper a voice
muffled in the folds of the dress:

'I killed a man!'

In all her life the Silver Lady had never been so startled or so
shocked.  She had grown so to love the bright, brilliant young girl
that the whispered confession cut through the silence of the dusk as
a shriek of murder goes through the silent gloom of night.  Her hands
flew wide from her breast, and the convulsive shudder which shook her
all in an instant woke Stephen through all her own deep emotion to
the instinct of protection of the other.  The girl looked up, shaking
her head, and said with a sadness which stilled all the other's fear:

'Ah!  Don't be frightened!  It is not murder that I tell you of.
Perhaps if it were, the thought would be easier to bear!  He would
have been hurt less if it had been only his body that I slew.  Well I
know now that his life would have been freely given if I wished it;
if it had been for my good.  But it was the best of him that I
killed; his soul.  His noble, loving, trusting, unselfish soul.  The
bravest and truest soul that ever had place in a man's breast! . . .
'  Her speaking ended with a sob; her body sank lower.

Sister Ruth's heart began to beat more freely.  She understood now,
and all the womanhood, all the wifehood, motherhood suppressed for a
lifetime, awoke to the woman's need.  Gently she stroked the
beautiful head that lay so meekly on her lap; and as the girl sobbed
with but little appearance of abatement, she said to her softly:

'Tell me, dear child.  Tell me all about it!  See! we are alone
together.  Thou and I; and God!  In God's dusk; with only the silent
land and sea before us!  Won't thou trust me, dear one, and speak!'

And then, as the shadows fell, and far-off lights at sea began to
twinkle over the waste of waters, Stephen found voice and told
without reserve the secret of her shame and her remorse.

At last, when her broken voice had trailed away into gentle catchings
of the breath, the older woman, knowing that the time come for
comfort, took her in her strong arms, holding her face wet against
her own, their tears mingling.

'Cry on, dear heart!' she said as she kissed her.  'Cry on!  It will
do thee good!'  She was startled once again as the other seemed for
an instant to grow rigid in her arms, and raising her hands cried out
in a burst of almost hysterical passion:

'Cry! cry!  Oh my God! my God!'  Then becoming conscious of her wet
face she seemed to become in an instant all limp, and sank on her
knees again.  There was so different a note in her voice that the
other's heart leaped as she heard her say:

'God be thanked for these tears!  Oh, thank God!  Thank God!'
Looking up she saw through the gloom the surprise in her companion's
eyes and answered their query in words:

'Oh! you don't know!  You can't know what it is to me!  I have not
cried since last I saw him pass from me in the wood!'


That time of confession seemed to have in some way cleared, purified
and satisfied Stephen's soul.  Life was now easier to bear.  She was
able to adapt herself, justifiably to the needs of her position; and
all around her and dependent on her began to realise that amongst
them was a controlling force, far-reaching sympathy, and a dominant
resolution that made for good.

She began to shake off the gloom of her sorrows and to take her place
in her new high station.  Friends there were in many, and quondam
lovers by the score.  Lovers of all sorts.  Fortune-hunters there
were be sure, not a few.  But no need was there for baseness when the
lady herself was so desirable; so young, so fair, so lovable.  That
she was of great estate and 'richly left' made all things possible to
any man who had sufficient acquisitiveness, or a good conceit of
himself.  In a wide circle of country were many true-lovers who would
have done aught to win her praise.

And so in the East the passing of the two years of silence and gloom
seemed to be the winning of something brighter to follow.



CHAPTER XXX--THE LESSON OF THE WILDERNESS



In the West the two years flew.  Time seemed to go faster there,
because life was more strenuous.  Harold, being mainly alone, found
endless work always before him.  From daylight to dark labour never
ceased; and for his own part he never wished that it should.  In the
wilderness, and especially under such conditions as held in Northern
Alaska, labour is not merely mechanical.  Every hour of the day is
fraught with danger in some new form, and the head has to play its
part in the strife against nature.  In such a life there is not much
time for thinking or brooding.

At first, when the work and his surroundings were strange to him,
Harold did many useless things and ran many unnecessary risks.  But
his knowledge grew with experience.  Privations he had in plenty; and
all the fibre of his body and the strength of his resolution and
endurance were now and again taxed to their utmost.  But with a man
of his nature and race the breaking strain is high; and endurance and
resolution are qualities which develop with practice.

Gradually his mind came back to normal level; he had won seemingly
through the pain that shadowed him.  Without anguish he could now
think, remember, look forward.  Then it was that the kindly wisdom of
the American came back to him, and came to stay.  He began to examine
himself as to his own part of the unhappy transaction; and stray
moments of wonderment came as to whether the fault may not, at the
very base, have his own.  He began to realise that it is insufficient
in this strenuous world to watch and wait; to suppress one's self; to
put aside, in the wish to benefit others, all the hopes, ambitions,
cravings which make for personal gain.

Thus it was that Harold's thoughts, ever circling round Stephen, came
back with increasing insistence to his duty towards her.  He often
thought, and with a bitter feeling against himself that it came too
late, of the dying trust of her father:

'Guard her and cherish her, as if you were indeed my son and she your
sister . . . If it should be that you and Stephen should find that
there is another affection between you remember I sanction it.  But
give her time!  I trust that to you!  She is young, and the world is
all before her.  Let her choose . . . And be loyal to her, if it is
another!  It may be a hard task; but I trust you, Harold!'

Here he would groan, as all the anguish of the past would rush back
upon him; and keenest of all would be the fear, suspicion, thought
which grew towards belief, that he may have betrayed that trust. . .
.

At first the side of this memory personal to his own happiness was
faintly emphasised; the important side was of the duty to Stephen.
But as time went on the other thought became a sort of corollary; a
timid, halting, blushing thought which followed sheepishly, borne
down by trembling hope.  No matter what adventure came to him, the
thought of neglected duty returned ever afresh.  Once, when he lay
sick for weeks in an Indian wigwam, the idea so grew with each day of
the monotony, that when he was able to crawl out by himself into the
sunshine he had almost made up his mind to start back for home.

Luck is a strange thing.  It seems in some mysterious way to be the
divine machinery for adjusting averages.  Whatever may be the measure
of happiness or unhappiness, good or evil, allotted to anyone, luck
is the cause or means of counter-balancing so that the main result
reaches the standard set.

From the time of Harold's illness Dame Fortune seemed to change her
attitude to him.  The fierce frown, nay! the malignant scowl, to
which he had become accustomed, changed to a smile.  Hitherto
everything seemed to have gone wrong with him; but now all at once
all seemed to go right.  He grew strong and hardy again.  Indeed, he
seemed by contrast to his late helplessness to be so strong and hard
that it looked as if that very illness had done him good instead of
harm.  Game was plentiful, and he never seemed to want.  Everywhere
he went there were traces of gold, as though by some instinct he was
tracking it to its home.  He did not value gold for its own sake; but
he did for the ardour of the search.  Harold was essentially a man,
and as a man an adventurer.  To such a man of such a race adventure
is the very salt of existence.

The adventurer's instinct took with it the adventurer's judgment;
Harold was not content with small results.  Amidst the vast primeval
forces there were, he felt, vast results of their prehistoric
working; and he determined to find some of them.  In such a quest,
purpose is much.  It was hardly any wonder, then, that in time Harold
found himself alone in the midst of one of the great treasure-places
of the world.  Only labour was needed to take from the earth riches
beyond the dreams of avarice.  But that labour was no easy problem;
great and difficult distance had to be overcome; secrecy must be
observed, for even a whisper of the existence of such a place would
bring a horde of desperadoes.  But all these difficulties were at
least sources of interest, if not in themselves pleasures.  The new
Harold, seemingly freshly created by a year of danger and strenuous
toil, of self-examining and humiliation, of the realisation of duty,
and--though he knew it not as yet--of the dawning of hope, found
delight in the thought of dangers and difficulties to be overcome.
Having taken his bearings exactly so as to be safe in finding the
place again, he took his specimens with him and set out to find the
shortest and best route to the nearest port.

At length he came to the port and set quietly about finding men.
This he did very carefully and very systematically.  Finally, with
the full complement, and with ample supply of stores, he started on
his expedition to the new goldfields.

It is not purposed to set out here the extraordinary growth of
Robinson City, for thus the mining camp soon became.  Its history has
long ago been told for all the world.  In the early days, when
everything had to be organised and protected, Harold worked like a
giant, and with a system and energy which from the first established
him as a master.  But when the second year of his exile was coming to
a close, and Robinson City was teeming with life and commerce, when
banks and police and soldiers made life and property comparatively
safe, he began to be restless again.  This was not the life to which
he had set himself.  He had gone into the wilderness to be away from
cities and from men; and here a city had sprung up around him and men
claimed him as their chief.  Moreover, with the restless feeling
there began to come back to him the old thoughts and the old pain.

But he felt strong enough by this time to look forward in life as
well as backward.  With him now to think was to act; so much at least
he had gained from his position of dominance in an upspringing city.
He quietly consolidated such outlying interests as he had, placed the
management of his great estate in the hands of a man he had learned
to trust, and giving out that he was going to San Francisco to
arrange some business, left Robinson City.  He had already
accumulated such a fortune that the world was before him in any way
he might choose to take.

Knowing that at San Francisco, to which he had booked, he would have
to run the gauntlet of certain of his friends and business
connections, he made haste to leave the ship quietly at Portland, the
first point she touched on her southern journey.  Thence he got on
the Canadian Pacific Line and took his way to Montreal.

What most arrested his attention, and in a very disconcerting way,
were the glimpses of English life one sees reproduced so faithfully
here and there in Canada.  The whole of the past rushed back on him
so overpoweringly that he was for the moment unnerved.  The acute
feeling of course soon became mitigated; but it was the beginning of
a re-realisation of what had been, and which grew stronger with each
mile as the train swept back eastward.

At first he tried to fight it; tried with all the resources of his
strong nature.  His mind was made up, he assured himself over and
over again.  The past was past, and what had been was no more to him
than to any of the other passengers of the train.  Destiny had long
ago fulfilled itself.  Stephen no doubt had by now found some one
worthy of her and had married.  In no dream, sleeping or waking,
could he ever admit that she had married Leonard; that was the only
gleam of comfort in what had grown to be remorse for his neglected
duty.

And so it was that Harold An Wolf slowly drifted, though he knew it
not, into something of the same intellectual position which had
dominated him when he had started on his journeying and the sunset
fell nightly on his despairing face.  The life in the wilderness, and
then in the dominance and masterdom of enterprise, had hardened and
strengthened him into more self-reliant manhood, giving him greater
forbearance and a more practical view of things.

When he took ship in the Dominion, a large cargo-boat with some
passengers running to London, he had a vague purpose of visiting in
secret Norcester, whence he could manage to find out how matters were
at Normanstand.  He would then, he felt, be in a better position to
regulate his further movements.  He knew that he had already a
sufficient disguise in his great beard.  He had nothing to fear from
the tracing of him on his journey from Alaska or the interest of his
fellow-passengers.  He had all along been so fortunate as to be able
to keep his identity concealed.  The name John Robinson told nothing
in itself, and the width of a whole great continent lay between him
and the place of his fame.  He was able to take his part freely
amongst both the passengers and the officers.  Even amongst the crew
he soon came to be known; the men liked his geniality, and
instinctively respected his enormous strength and his manifest force
of character.  Men who work and who know danger soon learn to
recognise the forces which overcome both.  And as sufficient time had
not elapsed to impair his hardihood or lower his vast strength he was
facile princeps.  And so the crew acknowledged him; to them he was a
born Captain whom to obey would be a natural duty.

After some days the weather changed.  The great ship, which usually
rested even-keeled on two waves, and whose bilge keels under normal
conditions rendered rolling impossible, began to pitch and roll like
a leviathan at play.  The decks, swept by gigantic seas, were injured
wherever was anything to injure. Bulwarks were torn away as though
they had been compact of paper.  More than once the double doors at
the head of the companion stairs had been driven in.  The bull's eye
glasses of some of the ports were beaten from their brazen sockets.
Nearly all the boats had been wrecked, broken or torn from their
cranes as the great ship rolled heavily in the trough, or giant waves
had struck her till she quivered like a frightened horse.

At that season she sailed on the far northern course.  Driven still
farther north by the gales, she came within a short way of south of
Greenland.  Then avoiding Moville, which should have been her place
of call, she ran down the east of Britain, the wild weather still
prevailing.



CHAPTER XXXI--THE LIFE-LINE



On the coast of Angleshire the weather in the early days of September
had been stormy.  With the south-west wind had come deluges of rain,
not a common thing for the time of year on the east coast.  Stephen,
whose spirits always rose with high wind, was in a condition of
prolonged excitement.  She could not keep still; every day she rode
long distances, and found a wonderful satisfaction in facing the
strong winds.  Like a true horsewoman she did not mind the wet, and
had glorious gallops over the grassy ridge and down the slopes on the
farther side, out on the open road or through the endless grass rides
amid the pine woods.

On the Tuesday morning the storm was in full sweep, and Stephen was
in wild spirits.  Nothing would do her but to go out on the tower of
the castle where she could walk about, and leaning on the crenellated
parapet look over all the coast stretching far in front and sweeping
away to the left and right.  The prospect so enchanted her, and the
fierce sweep of the wind so suited her exalted mood, that she
remained there all the morning.  The whole coast was a mass of
leaping foam and flying spray, and far away to the horizon white-
topped waves rolled endlessly.  That day she did not even ride out,
but contented herself with watching the sea and the storm from the
tower.  After lunch she went to her tower again; and again after tea.
The storm was now furious.  She made up her mind that after dinner
she would ride down and see its happenings close at hand.

When she had finished dinner she went to her room to dress for her
ride.  The rush and roar of the storm were in her ears, and she was
in wild tumultuous spirits.  All her youth seemed to sweep back on
her; or perhaps it was that the sickness of the last two years was
swept away.  Somewhere deep down in Stephen's heart, below her
intention or even her consciousness, was a desire to be her old self
if only for an hour.  And to this end externals were of help.
Without weighing the matter in her mind, and acting entirely on
impulse, she told her maid to get the red habit she had not worn for
years.  When she was dressed she sent round to have out her white
Arab; while it was getting ready she went once more to the tower to
see the storm-effect in the darkening twilight.  As she looked, her
heart for an instant stood still.  Half-way to the horizon a great
ship, ablaze in the bows, was driving through the waves with all her
speed.  She was heading towards the little port, beyond which the
shallows sent up a moving wall of white spray.

Stephen tore down the turret stair, and gave hurried directions to
have beds prepared in a number of rooms, fires everywhere, and plenty
of provisions.  She also ordered that carriages should be sent at
once to the fishing port with clothing and restoratives.  There
would, she felt, be need for such help before a time to be measured
by minutes should have passed; and as some of her servants were as
yet strange to her ways she did not leave anything to chance.  One
carriage was to go for the doctor who lived at Lannoy, the village
over the hill, whence nothing could be seen of what was happening.
She knew that others within sight or hailing would be already on
their way.  Work was afoot, and had she time, or thought of it, she
would have chosen a more sedate garb.  But in the excitement no
thought of herself came to her.

In a few seconds she was in the saddle, tearing at full speed down
the road that led to the port.  The wind was blowing so strongly in
her face that only in the lulls could she hear the hoof-strokes of
the groom's horse galloping behind her.

At first the height of the road allowed her to see the ship and the
port towards which she was making.  But presently the road dipped,
and the curving of the hill shut both from her sight; it was only
when she came close that she could see either again.

Now the great ship was close at hand.  The flames had gained
terribly, and it was a race for life or death.  There was no time do
more than run her aground if life was to be saved at all.  The
captain, who in the gaps of the smoke could be seen upon the bridge,
knew his work well.  As he came near the shoal he ran a little north,
and then turned sharply so as to throw the boat's head to the south
of the shoal.  Thus the wind would drive fire and smoke forward and
leave the after part of the vessel free for a time.

The shock of her striking the sand was terrific, though the tinkle of
the bell borne in on the gale showed that the engines had been slowed
down.  The funnels were shaken down, and the masts broke off, falling
forward.  A wild shriek from a hundred throats cleft the roaring of
wind and wave.  The mast fell, the foremast, with all its cumbering
top-hamper on the bridge, which was in an instant blotted out of
existence, together with the little band of gallant men who stood on
it, true to their last duty.  As the wind took the smoke south a man
was seen to climb on the wreck of the mast aft and make fast the end
of a great coil of rope which he carried.  He was a huge man with a
full dark beard.  Two sailors working with furious haste helped him
with the rope.  The waves kept raising the ship a little, each time
bumping her on the sand with a shock.  The people on deck held
frantically to the wreckage around them.

Then the bearded man, stripping to his waist and cutting off his
trousers above the knee, fastened an end of the rope round his waist.
The sailors stood ready one behind the other to pay it out.  As a
great wave rolled under the ship, he threw himself into the sea.

In the meantime the coastguard had fixed Board of Trade rocket-
apparatus, and in a few seconds the prolonged roar of a rocket was
heard.  It flew straight towards the ship, rising at a high angle so
as to fall beyond it.  But the force of the wind took it up as it
rose, and the gale increased so that it rose nearly vertically; and
in this position the wind threw it south of its objective, and short
of it.  Another rocket was got ready at once, and blue lights were
burned so that the course of the venturous swimmer might be noted.
He swam strongly; but the great weight of the rope behind kept
pulling him back, and the southern trend of the tide current and the
force of the wind kept dragging him from the pier.  Within the bar
the waves were much less than without; but they were still so unruly
that no boat in the harbour--which was not a lifeboat station--could
venture out.  Indeed, in the teeth of the storm it would have been a
physical impossibility to have driven one seaward.

As the gathered crowd saw Stephen approach they made way for her.
She had left her horse with the groom, and despite the drenching
spray fought a way against the wind out on the pier.  As in the glare
of the blue light, which brought many things into harsh unnatural
perspective, she caught sight of the set face of the swimmer rising
and falling with the waves, her heart leaped.  This was indeed a man!
a brave man; and all the woman in her went out to him.  For him, and
to aid him and his work, she would have given everything, done
anything; and in her heart, which beat in an ecstasy of anxiety, she
prayed with that desperate conviction of hope which comes in such
moments of exaltation.

But it soon became apparent that no landing could be effected.  The
force of the current and the wind were taking the man too far
southward for him ever to win a way back.  Then one of coastguards
took the lead-topped cane which they use for throwing practice, and,
after carefully coiling the line attached it so that it would run
free, managed with a desperate effort to fling it far out.  The
swimmer, to whom it fell close, fought towards it frantically; and as
the cord began to run through the water, managed to grasp it.  A wild
cheer rose from the shore and the ship.  A stout line was fastened to
the shore end of the cord, and the swimmer drew it out to him.  He
bent it on the rope which trailed behind him; then, seeing that he
was himself a drag on it, with the knife which he drew from the
sheath at the back of his waist, he cut himself free.  One of the
coastguards on the pier, helped by a host of willing hands, began
drawing the end of the rope on shore.  The swimmer still held the
line thrown to him, and several men on the pier began to draw on it.
Unhappily the thin cord broke under the strain, and within a few
seconds the swimmer had drifted out of possible help.  Seeing that
only wild rocks lay south of the sea-wall, and that on them seas beat
furiously, he turned and made out for sea.  In the light beyond the
glare he could see vaguely the shore bending away to the west in a
deep curve of unbroken white leaping foam.  There was no hope of
landing there.  To the south was the headland, perhaps two miles away
as the crow flies.  Here was the only chance for him.  If he could
round the headland, he might find shelter beyond; or somewhere along
the farther shore some opening might present itself.  Whilst the
light from the blue fires still reached him he turned and made for
the headland.

In the meantime on ship and on shore men worked desperately.  Before
long the end of the hawser was carried round on the high cliff, and
pulled as taut as the force at hand could manage, and made fast.
Soon endless ropes were bringing in passengers and crew as fast as
place could be found for them.  It became simply a race for time.  If
the fire, working against the wind, did not reach the hawser, and if
the ship lasted the furious bumping on the sandbank, which threatened
to shake her to pieces each moment, all on board might yet be saved.

Stephen's concern was now for the swimmer alone.  Such a gallant soul
should not perish without help, if help could be on this side of
heaven.  She asked the harbour-master, an old fisherman who knew
every inch of the coast for miles, if anything could be done.  He
shook his head sadly as he answered:

'I fear no, my lady.  The lifeboat from Granport is up north, no boat
from here could get outside the harbour.  There's never a spot in the
bay where he could land, even in a less troubled sea than this.  Wi'
the wind ashore, there's no hope for ship or man here that cannot
round the point.  And a stranger is no like to do that.'

'Why not?' she asked breathlessly.

'Because, my lady, there's a wheen o' sunken rocks beyond the Head.
No one that didn't know would ever think to keep out beyond them, for
the cliff itself goes down sheer.  He's a gallant soul yon; an' it's
a sore pity he's goin' to his death.  But it must be!  God can save
him if He wishes; but I fear none other!'

Even as he spoke rose to Stephen's mind a memory of an old churchyard
with great trees and the scent of many flowers, and a child's voice
that sounded harsh through the monotonous hum of bees:

'To be God, and able to do things!'

Oh; to be God, if but an hour; and able to do things!  To do anything
to help a brave man!  A wild prayer surged up in the girl's heart:

'Oh! God, give me this man's life!  Give it to me to atone for the
other I destroyed!  Let me but help him, and do with me as Thou
wilt!'

The passion of her prayer seemed to help her, and her brain cleared.
Surely something could be done!  She would do what she could; but
first she must understand the situation.  She turned again to the old
harbour-master:

'How long would it take him to reach the headland, if he can swim so
far?'  The answer came with a settled conviction bearing hope with
it:

'The wind and tide are wi' him, an' he's a strong swimmer.  Perhaps
half an hour will take him there.  He's all right in himself.  He can
swim it, sure.  But alack! it's when he gets there his trouble will
be, when none can warn him.  Look how the waves are lashing the
cliff; and mark the white water beyond!  What voice can sound to him
out in those deeps?  How could he see if even one were there to
warn?'

Here was a hope at any rate.  Light and sound were the factors of
safety.  Some good might be effected if she could get a trumpet; and
there were trumpets in the rocket-cart.  Light could be had--must be
had if all the fences round the headland had to be gathered for a
bonfire!  There was not a moment to be lost.  She ran to the rocket-
cart, and got a trumpet from the man in charge.  Then she ran to
where she had left her horse.  She had plenty of escort, for by this
time many gentlemen had arrived on horseback from outlying distances,
and all offered their services.  She thanked them and said:

'You may be useful here.  When all these are ashore send on the
rocket-cart, and come yourselves to the headland as quick as you can.
Tell the coastguards that all those saved are to be taken to the
castle.  In the rocket-cart bring pitch and tar and oil, and anything
that will flame.  Stay!' she cried to the chief boatman.  'Give me
some blue lights!'  His answer chilled her:

'I'm sorry, my lady, but they are all used.  There are the last of
them burning now.  We have burned them ever since that man began to
swim ashore.'

'Then hurry on the rocket-cart!' she said as she sprang to the
saddle, and swept out on the rough track that ran by the cliffs,
following in bold curves the windings of the shore.  The white Arab
seemed to know that his speed was making for life.  As he swept
along, far outdistancing the groom, Stephen's heart went out in
silent words which seemed to keep time to the gallop:

'Oh, to be God, and be able to do things!  Give me this man's life,
oh, God!  Give me this man's life, to atone for that noble one which
I destroyed!'

Faster and faster, over rough road, cattle track, and grassy sward;
over rising and falling ground; now and again so close to the edge of
the high cliff that the spume swept up the gulleys in the rocks like
a snowstorm, the white Arab swept round the curve of the bay, and
came out on the high headland where stood the fisher's house.  On the
very brink of the cliff all the fisher folk, men, women and children,
stood looking at the far-off burning ship, from which the flames rose
in leaping columns.

So intent were all on the cliff that they did not notice her coming;
as the roar of the wind came from them to her, they could not hear
her voice when she spoke from a distance.  She had drawn quite close,
having dismounted and hung her rein over the post of the garden
paling, when one of the children saw her, and cried out:

'The lady! the lady! an' she's all in red!'  The men were so intent
on something that they did not seem to hear.  They were peering out
to the north, and were arguing in dumb show as though on something
regarding which they did not agree.  She drew closer, and touching
the old fisherman on the shoulder, called out at his ear:

'What is it?'  He answered without turning, keeping his eyes fixed:

'_I_ say it's a man swimmin'.  Joe and Garge here say as it's only a
piece o' wood or sea-wrack.  But I know I'm right.  That's a man
swimmin', or my old eyes have lost their power!'  His words carried
conviction; the seed of hope in her beating heart grew on the instant
into certainty.

'It IS a man.  I saw him swim off towards here when he had taken the
rope on shore.  Do not turn round.  Keep your eyes on him so that you
may not lose sight of him in the darkness!'  The old man chuckled.

'This darkness!  Hee! hee!  There be no differ to me between light
and dark.  But I'll watch him!  It's you, my lady!  I shan't turn
round to do my reverence as you tell me to watch.  But, poor soul,
it'll not be for long to watch.  The Skyres will have him, sure
enow!'

'We can warn him!' she said, 'when he comes close enough.  I have a
trumpet here!'  He shook his head sorrowfully:

'Ah! my lady, what trumpet could sound against that storm an' from
this height?'  Stephen's heart sank.  But there was still hope.  If
the swimmer's ears could not be reached, his eyes might.  Eagerly she
looked back for the coming of the rocket-cart.  Far off across the
deep bay she could see its lamp sway as it passed over the rough
ground; but alas! it would never arrive in time.  With a note of
despair in her voice she asked:

'How long before he reaches the rocks?'  Still without turning the
old man answered:

'At the rate he's going he will be in the sweep of the current
through the rocks within three minutes.  If he's to be saved he must
turn seaward ere the stream grips him.'

'Would there be time to build a bonfire?'

'No, no! my lady.  The wood couldn't catch in the time!'

For an instant a black film of despair seemed to fall on her.  The
surging of the blood in her head made her dizzy, and once again the
prayer of the old memory rang in her brain:

'Oh to be God, and able to do things!'

On the instant an inspiration flashed through her.  She, too could do
things in a humble way.  She could do something at any rate.  If
there was no time to build a fire, there was a fire already built.

The house would burn!

The two feet deep of old thatch held down with nets and battened with
wreck timber would flare like a beacon.  Forthwith she spoke:

'Good people, this noble man who has saved a whole shipload of others
must not die without an effort.  There must be light so that he can
see our warning to pass beyond the rocks!  The only light can be from
the house.  I buy it of you.  It is mine; but I shall pay you for it
and build you such another as you never thought of.  But it must be
fired at once.  You have one minute to clear out all you want.  In,
quick and take all can.  Quick! quick! for God's sake!  It is for a
brave man's life!'

The men and women without a word rushed into the house.  They too
knew the danger, and the only hope there was for a life.  The
assurance of the Countess took the sting from the present loss.
Before the minute, which she timed watch in hand, was over, all came
forth bearing armloads of their lares and penates.  Then one of the
younger men ran in again and out bearing a flaming stick from the
fire.  Stephen nodded, he held it to the northern edge of the thatch.
The straw caught in a flash and the flame ran up the slope and along
the edge of the roof like a quick match.  The squeaking of many rats
was heard and their brown bodies streamed over the roof.  Before
another minute had passed a great mass of flame towered into the sky
and shed a red light far out over the waste of sea.

It lit up the wilderness of white water where the sea churned
savagely amongst the sunken rocks; and it lit too the white face of a
swimmer, now nearly spent, who rising and falling with each wave,
drifted in the sea whose current bore him on towards the fatal rocks.



CHAPTER XXXII--'TO BE GOD AND ABLE TO DO THINGS'



When the swimmer saw the light he looked up; even at the distance
they could see the lift of his face; but he did not seem to realise
that there was any intention in the lighting, or that it was created
for his benefit.  He was manifestly spent with his tremendous
exertions, and with his long heavy swim in the turbulent sea.
Stephen's heart went out to him in a wave of infinite pity.  She
tried to use the trumpet.  But simple as it is, a trumpet needs skill
or at least practice in its use; she could only make an
unintelligible sound, and not much even of that.  One of the young
men said:

'Let me try it, my lady!'  She handed him the trumpet and he in turn
used with a will.  But it was of no avail; even his strong lungs and
lusty manhood availed nothing in the teeth of that furious gale.  The
roof and the whole house was now well alight, and the flame roared
and leapt.  Stephen began to make gestures bidding the swimmer, in
case he might see her and understand, move round the rocks.  But he
made no change in his direction, and was fast approaching a point in
the tide-race whence to avoid the sunken rocks would be an
impossibility.  The old whaler, accustomed to use all his wits in
times of difficulty, said suddenly:

'How can he understand when we're all between him and the light.  We
are only black shadows to him; all he can see are waving arms!'  His
sons caught his meaning and were already dashing towards the burning
house.  They came back with piles of blazing wood and threw them down
on the very edge of the cliff; brought more and piled them up,
flinging heaps of straw on the bonfire and pouring on oil and pitch
till the flames rose high.  Stephen saw what was necessary and stood
out of the way, but close to the old whaler, where the light fell on
both of their faces as they looked in the direction of the swimmer.
Stephen's red dress itself stood out like a flame.  The gale tearing
up the front of the cliff had whirled away her hat; in the stress of
the wind her hair was torn from its up-pinning and flew wide, itself
like leaping flame.

Her gestures as she swept her right arm round, as though
demonstrating the outward curve of a circle, or raising the hand
above her head motioned with wide palm and spread fingers 'back!
back!' seemed to have reached the swimmer's intelligence.  He half
rose in the water and looked about.  As if seeing something that he
realised, he sank back again and began swim frantically out to sea.
A great throb of joy made Stephen almost faint.  At last she had been
able to do something to help this gallant man.  In half a minute his
efforts seemed to tell in his race for life.  He drew sufficiently
far from dangerous current for there to be a hope that he might be
saved if he could last out the stress to come.

The fishermen kept watch in silent eagerness; and in their presence
Stephen felt a comfort, though, like her, they could do nothing at
present.

When the swimmer had passed sufficiently far out to be clear of the
rocks, the fire began to lose its flame, though not its intensity.
It would be fiery still for hours to come, and of great heat; but the
flames ceased to leap, and in the moderated light Stephen only saw
the white face for one more instant ere it faded out of her ken,
when, turning, the man looked towards the light and made a gesture
which she did not understand:  for he put for an instant both hands
before his face.

Just then there was a wild noise on the cliff.  The rocket-cart drawn
by sixteen splendid horses, some of them hunters, came tearing up the
slope, and with it many men on horseback afoot.  Many of the runners
were the gentlemen who had given their horses for the good work.

As the coastguards jumped from the cart, and began to get out the
rocket stand, the old whaler pointed out the direction where the
swimmer's head could still be seen.  Some of the sailors could see it
too; though to Stephen and the laymen it was invisible.  The chief
boatman shook his head:

'No use throwing a line there!  Even if he got it we could never drag
him alive through these rocks.  He would be pounded to death before
twenty fathom!'  Stephen's heart grew cold as she listened.  Was this
the end?  Then with a bitter cry she wailed:

'Oh! can nothing be done?  Can nothing be done?  Can no boat come
from the other side of the point?  Must such a brave man be lost!'
and her tears began to flow.

One of the young men who had just arrived, a neighbouring squire, a
proved wastrel but a fine horseman, who had already regarded Stephen
at the few occasions of their meeting with eyes of manifest
admiration, spoke up:

'Don't cry, Lady de Lannoy.  There's a chance for him yet.  I'll see
what I can do.'

'Bless you! oh! bless you!' she cried impulsively as she caught his
hand.  Then came the chill of doubt.  'But what can you do?' she
added despairingly.

'Hector and I may be able to do something together.'  Turning to one
of the fishermen he asked:

'Is there any way down to the water in the shelter of the point?'

'Ay! ay! sir,' came the ready answer.  'There's the path as we get
down by to our boats.'

'Come on, then!' he said.  'Some of you chaps show us a light on the
way down.  If Hector can manage the scramble there's a chance.  You
see,' he said, turning again to Stephen, 'Hector can swim like a
fish.  When he was a racer I trained him in the sea so that none of
the touts could spy out his form.  Many's the swim we've had
together; and in rough water too, though in none so wild as this!'

'But it is a desperate chance for you!' said Stephen, woman-like
drawing somewhat back from a danger she had herself evoked.  The
young man laughed lightly:

'What of that!  I may do one good thing before I die.  That fine
fellow's life is worth a hundred of my wasted one!  Here! some of you
fellows help me with Hector.  We must take him from the cart and get
a girth on him instead of the saddle.  We shall want something to
hold on to without pulling his head down by using the bridle.'

He, followed by some others, ran to the rocket-cart where the horses
stood panting, their steam rising in a white cloud in the glow of the
burning house.  In an incredibly short time the horse was ready with
only the girth.  The young squire took him by the mane and he
followed eagerly; he had memories of his own.  As they passed close
to Stephen the squire said to one of his friends:

'Hold him a minute, Jack!'  He ran over to Stephen and looked at her
hard:

'Good-bye!  Wish me luck; and give us light!'  Tears were in her eyes
and a flush on her cheek as she took his hand and clasped it hard:

'Oh, you brave man!  God bless you!'  He stooped suddenly and
impulsively kissed the back of her hand lightly and was gone.  For a
fleeting moment she was angry.  No man had kissed her hand before;
but the thought of his liberty was swept away by another:

'Little enough when he may be going to his death!'

It was a sight to see that man and horse, surrounded by an eager
crowd of helpers, scrambling down the rough zigzag, cut and worn in
the very face of the cliff.  They stumbled, and slipped; pebbles and
broken rock fell away under their feet.  Alone close to the bonfire
stood Stephen, following every movement with racing blood and beating
heart.  The bonfire was glowing; a constant stream of men and women
were dragging and hauling all sorts of material for its increase.
The head of the swimmer could be seen, rising and falling amid the
waves beyond the Skyres.

When about twenty feet from the water-level the path jutted out to
one side left of the little beach whereon the sea now broke fiercely.
This was a place where men watched, and whence at times they fished
with rods; the broad rock overhung the water.  The fire above, though
it threw shadows, made light enough for everything.  The squire held
up his hand.

'Stop!  We can take off this rock, if the water is deep enough.  How
much is it?'

'Ten fathoms sheer.'

'Good!'  He motioned to them all to keep back.  Then threw off all
his clothes except shirt and trousers.  For an instant he patted
Hector and then sprang upon his back.  Holding him by the mane he
urged him forward with a cry.  The noble animal did not hesitate an
instant.  He knew that grasp of the mane; that cry; that dig of the
spurless heels.  He sprang forward with wide dilated nostrils, and
from the edge of the jutting rock jumped far out into the sea.  Man
and horse disappeared for a few seconds, but rose safely.  The man
slid from the horse's back; and, holding by the girth with one hand,
swam beside him out to sea in the direction the swimmer must come on
rounding the sunken rocks.

A wild cheer broke from all on the cliff above and those already
scrambling back up the zigzag.  Stephen kept encouraging the men to
bring fuel to the bonfire:

'Bring everything you can find; the carts, the palings, the roofs,
the corn, the dried fish; anything and everything that will burn.  We
must have light; plenty of light!  Two brave men's lives are at stake
now!'

The whole place was a scene of activity.  Stephen stood on the edge
of the cliff with the old whaler and the chief boatman and some of
the women.  The rest of the coastguards were by orders of their chief
rigging up a whip which they thought might be necessary to hoist the
men up from the water, if they could ever get close enough.  One of
the young men who had ridden with the rocket-cart kept tight hold of
Hector's bridle; he knew it would be wanted if the horse ever had a
chance of landing.


When Harold turned away from the dazzling blue lights on the pier,
and saw the far white line of the cliffs beyond the bay, his heart
sank within him.  Even his great strength and hardihood, won by work
and privation in the far North-West, had been already taxed in the
many days of the battling with the gale when all on board who could
lend a hand were taken into service.  Again by the frantic struggle
of the last hour or two, when the ship ran shoreward at the utmost of
her speed in the last hope of beaching in time to save life.  Finally
in that grim struggle to draw the life-line shoreward.  The cold and
then the great heat, and on top of it the chill of the long swim,
seemed to have struck at him.  Alone on the dark sea, for soon the
current and his own exertions were taking him away from the rocks,
the light of the burning ship was ceasing to be effective.  It was
just enough to hinder his vision; looking from the patch of light
which bathed the light and him he could just see far off the white
water which marked the cliff fronts, and on the edge of his horizon
the grim moving white wall where the waves broke on the headland.

On and on he toiled.  His limbs were becoming more cramped with the
cold and the terrible strain of swimming in such waves.  But still
the brave heart bore him up; and resolutely, sternly he forced
himself afresh to the effort before him.  He reasoned that where
there was such a headland standing out so stark into the sea there
ought to be some shelter in its lee.  If he could pass it he might
find calmer water and even a landing-place beyond.

Here at least was hope.  He would try to round the point at any rate.
Now he drew so close that the great rocks seemed to tower vast above
him.  He was not yet close enough to feel as though lapped in their
shadow; but even the overcast sky seemed full of light above the line
of the cliff.  There was a strange roaring, rushing sound around him.
He thought that it was not merely the waves dashing on the rocks, but
that partly it came from his own ears; that his ebbing strength was
feeling the frantic struggle which he was making.  The end was
coming, he thought; but still he kept valiantly on, set and silent,
as is the way with brave men.

Suddenly from the top of the cliff a bright light flashed.  He looked
at it sideways as he fought his way on, and saw the light rise and
fall and flicker as the flames leaped.  High over him he saw
fantastic figures which seemed to dance on the edge of the high
cliff.  They had evidently noticed him, and were making signals of
some sort; but what the motions were he could not see or understand,
for they were but dark silhouettes, edged with light, against the
background of fire.  The only thing he could think was that they
meant to encourage him, and so he urged himself to further effort.
It might be that help was at hand!

Several times as he turned his head sideways he saw the figures and
the light, but not so clearly; it was as though the light was
lessening in power.  When again he looked he saw a new fire leap out
on the edge of the cliff, and some figures to the right of it.  They
were signalling in some way.  So, pausing in his swimming, he rose a
little from the water and looked at them.

A thrill shot through him, and a paralysing thought that he must have
gone mad.  With his wet hand he cleared his eyes, though the touching
them pained him terribly, and for an instant saw clearly:

There on the edge of the cliff, standing beside some men and waving
her arms in a wild sweep as though motioning frantically 'Keep out!
keep out!' was a woman.  Instinctively he glanced to his left and saw
a white waste of leaping water, through which sharp rocks rose like
monstrous teeth.  On the instant he saw the danger, and made out
seaward, swimming frantically to clear the dangerous spot before the
current would sweep him upon the rocks.

But the woman!  As one remembers the last sight when the lightning
has banished sight, so that vision seemed burned into his brain.  A
woman with a scarlet riding-habit and masses of long red hair blowing
in the gale like leaping flame!  Could there be two such persons in
the world?  No! no!  It was a vision!  A vision of the woman he
loved, come to save him in the direst moment of great peril!

His heart beat with new hope; only the blackness of the stormy sea
was before him as he strove frantically on.

Presently when he felt the current slacken, for he had been swimming
across it and could feel its power, he turned and looked back.  As he
did so he murmured aloud:

'A dream!  A vision!  She came to warn me!'  For as he looked all had
disappeared.  Cliff and coastline, dark rocks and leaping seas,
blazing fire, and the warning vision of the woman he loved.

Again he looked where the waste of sea churning amongst the sunken
rocks had been.  He could hear the roaring of waters, the thunder of
great waves beating on the iron-bound coast; but nothing could he
see.  He was alone on the wild sea; in the dark.

Then truly the swift shadow of despair fell upon him.

'Blind  Blind!' he moaned, and for the moment, stricken with despair,
sank into the trough of the waves.  But the instinctive desire for
life recalled him.  Once more he fought his way up to the surface,
and swam blindly, desperately on.  Seeing nothing, he did not know
which way he was going.  He might have heard better had his eyes been
able to help his ears; but in the sudden strange darkness all the
senses were astray.  In the agony of his mind he could not even feel
the pain of his burnt face; the torture of his eyes had passed.  But
with the instinct of a strong man he kept on swimming blindly,
desperately.


It seemed as if ages of untold agony had gone by, when he heard a
voice seemingly beside him:

'Lay hold here!  Catch the girth!'  The voice came muffled by wind
and wave.  His strength was now nearly at its last.

The shock of his blindness and the agony of the moments that had
passed had finished his exhaustion.  But a little longer and he must
have sunk into his rest.  But the voice and the help it promised
rallied him for a moment.  He had hardly strength to speak, but he
managed to gasp out:

'Where? where?  Help me!  I am blind!'  A hand took his and guided it
to a tightened girth.  Instinctively his fingers closed round it, and
he hung on grimly.  His senses were going fast.  He felt as if it was
all a strange dream.  A voice here in the sea!  A girth!  A horse; he
could hear its hard breathing.

The voice came again.

'Steady!  Hold on!  My God! he's fainted!  I must tie him on!'  He
heard a tearing sound, and something was wound round his wrists.
Then his nerveless fingers relaxed their hold; and all passed into
oblivion.



CHAPTER XXXIII--THE QUEEN'S ROOM



To Stephen all that now happened seemed like a dream.  She saw Hector
and his gallant young master forge across the smoother water of the
current whose boisterous stream had been somewhat stilled in the
churning amongst the rocks, and then go north in the direction of the
swimmer who, strange to say, was drifting in again towards the sunken
rocks.  Then she saw the swimmer's head sink under the water; and her
heart grew cold.  Was this to be the end!  Was such a brave man to be
lost after such gallant effort as he had made, and just at the moment
when help was at hand!

The few seconds seemed ages.  Instinctively she shut her eyes and
prayed again.  'Oh! God.  Give me this man's life that I may atone!'

God seemed to have heard her prayer.  Nay, more!  He had mercifully
allowed her to be the means of averting great danger.  She would
never, could never, forget the look on the man's face when he saw, by
the flame that she had kindled, ahead of him the danger from the
sunken rocks.  She had exulted at the thought.  And now . . .

She was recalled by a wild cheer beside her.  Opening her eyes she
saw that the man's head had risen again from the water.  He was
swimming furiously, this time seaward.  But close at hand were the
heads of the swimming horse and man . . . She saw the young squire
seize the man . . .

And then the rush of her tears blinded her.  When she could see again
the horse had turned and was making back again to the shelter of the
point.  The squire had his arm stretched across the horse's back; he
was holding up the sailor's head, which seemed to roll helplessly
with every motion of the cumbering sea.

For a little she thought he was dead, but the voice of the old whaler
reassured her:

'He was just in time!  The poor chap was done!'  And so with beating
heart and eyes that did not flinch now she watched the slow progress
to the shelter of the point.  The coastguards and fishermen had made
up their minds where the landing could be made, and were ready; on
the rocky shelf, whence Hector had at jumped, they stood by with
lines.  When the squire had steered and encouraged the horse, whose
snorting could be heard from the sheltered water, till he was just
below the rocks, they lowered a noosed rope.  This he fastened round
the senseless man below his shoulders.  One strong, careful pull, and
he was safe on land; and soon was being borne up the steep zigzag on
the shoulders of the willing crowd.

In the meantime other ropes were passed down to the squire.  One he
placed round his own waist; two others he fastened one on each side
of the horse's girth.  Then his friend lowered the bridle, and he
managed to put it on the horse and attached a rope to it.  The
fishermen took the lines, and, paying out as they went so as to leave
plenty of slack line, got on the rocks just above the little beach
whereon, sheltered though it was, the seas broke heavily.  There they
waited, ready to pull the horse through the surf when he should have
come close enough.

Stephen did not see the rescue of the horse; for just then a tall
grave man spoke to her:

'Pardon me, Lady de Lannoy, but is the man to be brought up to the
Castle?  I am told you have given orders that all the rescued shall
be taken there.'  She answered unhesitatingly

'Certainly!  I gave orders before coming out that preparation was to
be made for them.'

'I am Mr. Hilton.  I have just come down to do lacum tenens for Dr.
Winter at Lannoch Port.  I rode over on hearing there was a wreck,
and came here with the rocket-cart.  I shall take charge of the man
and bring him up.  He will doubtless want some special care.'

'If you will be so good!' she answered, feeling a diffidence which
was new to her.  At that moment the crowd carrying the senseless man
began to appear over the cliff, coming up the zig-zag.  The Doctor
hurried towards him; she followed at a little distance, fearing lest
she should hamper him.  Under his orders they laid the patient on the
weather side of the bonfire so that the smoke would not reach him.
The Doctor knelt by his side.

An instant after he looked up and said:

'He is alive; his heart is beating, though faintly.  He had better be
taken away at once.  There is no means here of shelter.'

'Bring him in the rocket-cart; it is the only conveyance here,' cried
Stephen.  'And bring Mr. Hepburn too.  He also will need some care
after his gallant service.  I shall ride on and advise my household
of your coming.  And you good people come all to the Castle.  You are
to be my guests if you will so honour me.  No!  No!  Really I should
prefer to ride alone!'

She said this impulsively, seeing that several of the gentlemen were
running for their horses to accompany her.  'I shall not wait to
thank that valiant young gentleman.  I shall see him at Lannoy.'

As she was speaking she had taken the bridle of her horse.  One of
the young men stooped and held his hand; she bowed, put her foot in
it and sprang to the saddle.  In an instant she was flying across
country at full speed, in the dark.  A wild mood was on her, reaction
from the prolonged agony of apprehension.  There was little which she
would not have done just then.

The gale whistled round her and now and again she shouted with pure
joy.  It seemed as if God Himself had answered her prayer and given
her the returning life!

By the time she had reached the Castle the wild ride had done its
soothing work.  She was calm again, comparatively; her wits and
feelings were her own.

There was plenty to keep her occupied, mind and body.  The train of
persons saved from the wreck were arriving in all sorts of vehicles,
and as clothes had to be found for them as well as food and shelter
there was no end to the exertions necessary.  She felt as though the
world were not wide enough for the welcome she wished to extend.  Its
exercise was a sort of reward of her exertions; a thank-offering for
the response to her prayer.  She moved amongst her guests, forgetful
of herself; of her strange attire; of the state of dishevelment and
grime in which she was, the result of the storm, her long ride over
rough ground with its share of marshes and pools, and the smoke from
the bonfire and the blazing house.  The strangers wondered at first,
till they came to understand that she was the Lady Bountiful who had
stretched her helpful hands to them.  Those who could, made
themselves useful with the new batches of arrivals.  The whole Castle
was lit from cellar to tower.  The kitchens were making lordly
provision, the servants were carrying piles of clothes of all sorts,
and helping to fit those who came still wet from their passage
through or over the heavy sea.

In the general disposition of chambers Stephen ordered to be set
apart for the rescued swimmer the Royal Chamber where Queen Elizabeth
had lain; and for Mr. Hepburn that which had been occupied by the
Second George.  She had a sort of idea that the stranger was God's
guest who was coming to her house; and that nothing could be too good
for him.  As she waited for his coming, even though she swept to and
fro in her ministrations to others, she felt as though she trod on
air.  Some great weight seemed to have been removed from her.  Her
soul was free again!

At last the rocket-cart arrived, and with it many horsemen and such
men and women as could run across country with equal speed to the
horses labouring by the longer road.

The rescued man was still senseless, but that alone did not seem to
cause anxiety to the Doctor, who hurried him at once into the
prepared room.  When, assisted by some of the other men, he had
undressed him, rubbed him down and put him to bed, and had seen some
of the others who had been rescued from the wreck, he sought out Lady
de Lannoy.  He told her that his anxiety was for the man's sight; an
announcement which blanched his hearer's cheeks.  She had so made up
her mind as to his perfect safety that the knowledge of any kind of
ill came like a cruel shock.  She questioned Mr. Hilton closely; so
closely that he thought it well to tell her at once all that he
surmised and feared:

'That fine young fellow who swam out with his horse to him, tells me
that when he neared him he cried out that he was blind.  I have made
some inquiries from those on the ship, and they tell me that he was a
passenger, named Robinson.  Not only was he not blind then, but he
was the strongest and most alert man on the ship.  If it be blindness
it must have come on during that long swim.  It may be that before
leaving the ship he received some special injury--indeed he has
several cuts and burns and bruises--and that the irritation of the
sea-water increased it.  I can do nothing till he wakes.  At present
he is in such a state that nothing can be done for him.  Later I
shall if necessary give him a hypodermic to ensure sleep.  In the
morning when I come again I shall examine him fully.'

'But you are not going away to-night!' said Stephen in dismay.
'Can't you manage to stay here?  Indeed you must!  Look at all these
people, some of whom may need special attention or perhaps treatment.
We do not know yet if any may be injured.'  He answered at once:

'Of course I shall stay if you wish it.  But there are two other
doctors here already.  I must go over to my own place to get some
necessary instruments for the examination of this special patient.
But that I can do in the early morning.'

'Can I not send for what you want; the whole household are at your
service.  All that can be done for that gallant man must be done.
You can send to London for special help if you wish.  If that man is
blind, or in danger of blindness, we must have the best oculist in
the world for him.'

'All shall be done that is possible,' said he earnestly.  'But till I
examine him in the morning we can do nothing.  I am myself an
oculist; that is my department in St. Stephen's Hospital.  I have an
idea of what is wrong, but I cannot diagnose exactly until I can use
the ophthalmoscope.'  His words gave Stephen confidence.  Laying her
hand on his arm unconsciously in the extremity of pity she said
earnestly:

'Oh, do what you can for him.  He must be a noble creature; and all
that is possible must be done.  I shall never rest happily if through
any failing on my part he suffers as you fear.'

'I shall do all I can,' he said with equal earnestness, touched with
her eager pity.  'And I shall not trust myself alone, if any other
can be of service.  Depend upon it, Lady de Lannoy, all shall be as
you wish.'

There was little sleep in the Castle that night till late.  Mr.
Hilton slept on a sofa in the Queen's Room after he had administered
a narcotic to his patient.

As soon as the eastern sky began to quicken, he rode, as he had
arranged during the evening, to Dr. Winter's house at Lannoch Port
where he was staying.  After selecting such instruments and drugs as
he required, he came back in the dogcart.

It was still early morning when he regained the Castle.  He found
Lady de Lannoy up and looking anxiously for him.  Her concern was
somewhat abated when he was able to tell her that his patient still
slept.

It was a painful scene for Mr. Hilton when his patient woke.
Fortunately some of the after-effects of the narcotic remained, for
his despair at realising that he was blind was terrible.  It was not
that he was violent; to be so under his present circumstances would
have been foreign to Harold's nature.  But there was a despair which
was infinitely more sad to witness than passion.  He simply moaned to
himself:

'Blind!  Blind!' and again in every phase of horrified amazement, as
though he could not realise the truth:  'Blind!  Blind!'  The Doctor
laid his hand on his breast and said very gently:

'My poor fellow, it is a dreadful thing to face, to think of.  But as
yet I have not been able to come to any conclusion; unable even to
examine you.  I do not wish to encourage hopes that may be false, but
there are cases when injury is not vital and perhaps only temporary.
In such case your best chance, indeed your only chance, is to keep
quiet.  You must not even think if possible of anything that may
excite you.  I am now about to examine you with the ophthalmoscope.
You are a man; none of us who saw your splendid feat last night can
doubt your pluck.  Now I want you to use some of it to help us both.
You, for your recovery, if such is possible; me, to help me in my
work.  I have asked some of your late companions who tell me that on
shipboard you were not only well and of good sight, but that you were
remarkable even amongst strong men.  Whatever it is you suffer from
must have come on quickly.  Tell me all you can remember of it.'

The Doctor listened attentively whilst Harold told all he could
remember of his sufferings.  When he spoke of the return of old
rheumatic pains his hearer said involuntarily:  'Good!'  Harold
paused; but went on at once.  The Doctor recognised that he had
rightly appraised his remark, and by it judged that he was a well-
educated man.  Something in the method of speaking struck him, and he
said, as nonchalantly as he could:

'By the way, which was your University?'

'Cambridge.  Trinity.'  He spoke without thinking, and the instant he
had done so stopped.  The sense of his blindness rushed back on him.
He could not see; and his ears were not yet trained to take the place
of his eyes.  He must guard himself.  Thenceforward he was so
cautious in his replies that Mr. Hilton felt convinced there was some
purpose in his reticence.  He therefore stopped asking questions, and
began to examine him.  He was unable to come to much result; his
opinion was shown in his report to Lady de Lannoy:

'I am unable to say anything definite as yet.  The case is a most
interesting one; as a case and quite apart from the splendid fellow
who is the subject of it.  I have hopes that within a few days I may
be able to know more.  I need not trouble you with surgical terms;
but later on if the diagnosis supports the supposition at present in
my mind I shall be able to speak more fully.  In the meantime I
shall, with your permission, wait here so that I may watch him
myself.'

'Oh you are good.  Thank you!  Thank you!' said Stephen.  She had so
taken the man under her own care that she was grateful for any
kindness shown to him.

'Not at all'' said Mr. Hilton.  'Any man who behaved as that fellow
did has a claim on any of us who may help him.  No time of mine could
be better spent.'

When he went back to the patient's room he entered softly, for he
thought he might be asleep.  The room was, according to his
instructions, quite dark, and as it was unfamiliar to him he felt his
way cautiously.  Harold, however, heard the small noise he made and
said quietly:

'Who is there?'

'It is I; Hilton.'

'Are you alone?'

'Yes.'

'Look round the room and see.  Then lock the door and come and talk
to me if you will.  You will pity a poor blind fellow, I know.  The
darkness has come down upon me so quickly that I am not accustomed to
it!'  There was a break in his voice which moved the other.  He lit a
candle, feeling that the doing so would impress his patient, and went
round the room; not with catlike movement this time--he wanted the
other to hear him.  When he had turned the key in the lock, as
sharply as he could, he came to the bedside and sat down.  Harold
spoke again after a short pause:

'Is that candle still lit?'

'Yes!  Would you like it put out?'

'If you don't mind!  Again I say pity me and pardon me.  But I want
to ask you something privately, between our two selves; and I will
feel more of equality than if you were looking at me, whilst I cannot
see you.'  Mr Hilton blew out the candle.

'There!  We are equal now.'

'Thank you!'  A long pause; then he went on:

'When a man becomes suddenly blind is there usually, or even
occasionally, any sort of odd sight? . . . Does he see anything like
a dream, a vision?'

'Not that I know of.  I have never heard of such a case.  As a rule
people struck blind by lightning, which is the most common cause,
sometimes remember with extraordinary accuracy the last thing they
have seen.  Just as though it were photographed on the retina!'

'Thank you!  Is such usually the recurrence of any old dream or
anything they have much thought of?'

'Not that I know of.  It would be unusual!'  Harold waited a long
time before he spoke again.  When he did so it was in a different
voice; a constrained voice.  The Doctor, accustomed to take
enlightenment from trivial details, noted it:

'Now tell me, Mr. Hilton, something about what has happened.  Where
am I?'

'In Lannoy Castle.'

'Where is it?'

'In Angleshire!'

'Who does it belong to?'

'Lady de Lannoy.  The Countess de Lannoy; they tell me she is a
Countess in her own right.'

'It is very good of her to have me here.  Is she an old lady?'

'No!  A young one.  Young and very beautiful.'  After a pause before
his query:

'What's she like?  Describe her to me!'

'She is young, a little over twenty.  Tall and of a very fine figure.
She has eyes like black diamonds, and hair like a flame!'  For a long
time Harold remained still.  Then he said:

'Tell me all you know or have learned of this whole affair.  How was
I rescued, and by whom?'  So the Doctor proceeded to give him every
detail he knew of.  When he was quite through, the other again lay
still for a long time.  The silence was broken by a gentle tap at the
door.  The Doctor lit a candle.  He turned the key softly, so that no
one would notice that the door was locked.  Something was said in a
low whisper.  Then the door was gently closed, and the Doctor
returning said:

'Lady Lannoy wants, if it will not disturb you, to ask how you are.
Ordinarily I should not let anyone see you.  But she is not only your
hostess, but, as I have just told you, it was her ride to the
headland, where she burned the house to give you light, which was the
beginning of your rescue.  Still if you think it better not . . . !'

'I hardly like anybody to see me like this!' said Harold, feebly
seeking an excuse.

'My dear man,' said the other, 'you may be easy in your mind, she
won't see much of you.  You are all bandages and beard.  She'll have
to wait a while before she sees you.'

'Didn't she see me last night?'

'Not she!  Whilst we were trying to restore you she was rushing back
to the Castle to see that all was ready for you, and for the others
from the wreck.'  This vaguely soothed Harold.

If his surmise was correct, and if she had not seen him then, it was
well that he was bandaged now.  He felt that it would not do to
refuse to let her see him; it might look suspicious.  So after
pausing a short while he said in a low voice:

'I suppose she had better come now.  We must not keep her waiting!'
When the Doctor brought her to his bedside Stephen felt in a measure
awed.  His bandaged face and head and his great beard, singed in
patches, looked to her in the dim light rather awesome.  In a very
gentle voice she said kind things to the sick man, who acknowledged
them in a feeble whisper.  The Doctor, a keen observer, noticed the
change in his voice, and determined to understand more.  Stephen
spoke of his bravery, and of how it was due to him that all on the
ship were saved; and as she spoke her emotion moved her so much that
her sweet voice shook and quivered.  To the ears of the man who had
now only sound to guide him, it was music of the sweetest he had ever
heard.  Fearing lest his voice should betray him, he whispered his
own thanks feebly and in few words.

When Stephen went away the Doctor went with her; it was more than an
hour before he returned.  He found his patient in what he considered
a state of suppressed excitement; for, though his thoughts were
manifestly collected and his words were calm, he was restless and
excited in other ways.  He had evidently been thinking of his own
condition; for shortly after the Doctor came in he said:

'Are we alone?'

'Quite!'

'I want you to arrange that there shall not be any nurse with me.'

'My dear sir!  Don't handicap me, and yourself, with such a
restriction.  It is for your own good that you should have regular
and constant attention.'

'But I don't wish it.  Not for the present at all events.  I am not
accustomed to a nurse, and shall not feel comfortable.  In a few days
perhaps . . . '  The decided tone of his voice struck the other.
Keeping his own thoughts and intentions in abeyance, even to himself,
he answered heartily:

'All right!  I shall not have any nurse, at present.'

'Thanks!'  There was relief in the tone which seemed undue, and Mr.
Hilton again took mental note.  Presently he asked a question, but in
such a tone that the Doctor pricked up his ears.  There was a
premeditated self-suppression, a gravity of restraint, which implied
some falsity; some intention other than the words conveyed:

'It must have been a job to carry me up those stairs.'  The Doctor
was doubting everything, but as the safest attitude he stuck to
literal truth so far as his words conveyed it:

'Yes.  You are no light weight!'  To himself he mused:

'How did he know there were stairs?  He cannot know it; he was
senseless!  Therefore he must be guessing or inquiring!'  Harold went
on:

'I suppose the Castle is on high ground.  Can you see far from the
windows?  I suppose we are up a good height?'

'From the windows you can see all round the promontory.  But we are
not high up; that is, the room is not high from the ground, though
the Castle is from the sea.'  Harold asked again, his voice vibrating
in the note of gladness:

'Are we on the ground floor then?'

'Yes.'

'And I suppose the gardens are below us?'

'Yes.'  The answer was given quickly, for a thought was floating
through him:  Why did this strong brave man, suddenly stricken blind,
wish to know whether his windows were at a height?  He was not
surprised when his patient reaching out a hand rested it on his arm
and said in an imploring tone:

'It should be moonlight; full moon two nights ago.  Won't you pull up
the blind and describe to me all you see? . . . Tell me fully . . .
Remember, I am blind!'

This somehow fixed the Doctor's thought:

'Suicide!  But I must convey the inutility of such effort by
inference, not falsity.'

Accordingly he began to describe the scene, from the very base of the
wall, where below the balcony the great border was glorious with a
mass of foliage plants, away to the distant sea, now bathed in the
flood of moonlight.  Harold asked question after question; the Doctor
replying accurately till he felt that the patient was building up a
concrete idea of his surroundings near and far.  Then he left him.
He stood for a long time out in the passage thinking.  He said to
himself as he moved away:

'The poor fellow has some grim intention in his mind.  I must not let
him know that I suspect; but to-night I will watch without his
knowing it!'



CHAPTER XXXIV--WAITING



Mr. Hilton telegraphed at once countermanding, for the present, the
nurse for whom he had sent.

That night, when the household had all retired, he came quietly to
his patient's room, and entering noiselessly, sat silent in a far
corner.  There was no artificial right; the patient had to be kept in
darkness.  There was, however, a bright moonlight; sufficient light
stole in through the edges of the blinds to allow him, when his eyes
grew accustomed, to see what might happen.

Harold lay quite still till the house was quiet.  He had been
thinking, ever since he had ascertained the identity of Stephen.  In
his weakness and the paralysing despair of his blindness all his
former grief and apprehension had come bank upon him in a great wave;
veritably the tide of circumstances seemed to run hard against him.
He had had no idea of forcing himself upon Stephen; and yet here he
was a guest in her house, without her knowledge or his own.  She had
saved his life by her energy and resource.  Fortunately she did not
as yet know him; the bandages, and his act in suppressing his voice,
had so far protected him.  But such could not last for long.  He
could not see to protect himself, and take precautions as need arose.
And he knew well that Stephen's nature would not allow her to be
satisfied without doing all that was possible to help one who had
under her eyes made a great effort on behalf of others, and to whom
there was the added bond that his life was due to her.  In but a
little time she must find out to whom she ministered.

What then would happen?  Her kindness was such that when she realised
the blindness of her old friend she might so pity him that out of the
depths of her pity she would forgive.  She would take back all the
past; and now that she knew of his old love for her, would perhaps be
willing to marry him.  Back flooded the old memory of her
independence and her theory of sexual equality.  If out of any
selfish or mistaken idea she did not hesitate to ask a man to marry
her, would it be likely that when the nobler and more heroic side of
her nature spoke she would hesitate to a similar act in pursuance of
her self-sacrifice?

So it might be that she would either find herself once again flouted,
or else married to a man she did not love.

Such a catastrophe should not happen, whatever the cost to him.  He
would, blind as he was, steal away in the night and take himself out
of her life; this time for ever.  Better the ingratitude of an
unknown man, the saving of whose life was due to her, than the long
dull routine of a spoiled life, which would otherwise be her unhappy
lot.

When once this idea had taken root in his mind he had taken such
steps as had been open to him without endangering the secrecy of his
motive.  Thanks to his subtle questioning of the Doctor, he now knew
that his room was close to the ground, so that he would easily drop
from the window and steal away with out immediate danger of any
restraining accident.  If he could once get away he would be all
right.  There was a large sum to his credit in each of two London
banks.  He would manage somehow to find his way to London; even if he
had to walk and beg his way.

He felt that now in the silence of the night the time had come.
Quietly he rose and felt his way to the door, now and again stumbling
and knocking against unknown obstacles in the manner of the recently
blind.  After each such noise he paused and listened.  He felt as if
the very walls had ears.  When he reached the door he turned the key
softly.  Then he breathed more freely.  He felt that he was at last
alone and free to move without suspicion.

Then began a great and arduous search; one that was infinitely
difficult and exasperating; and full of pathos to the sympathetic man
who watched him in silence.  Mr. Hilton could not understand his
movements as he felt his way about the room, opening drawers and
armoires, now and again stooping down and feeling along the floor.
He did not betray his presence, however, but moved noiselessly away
as the other approached.  It was a hideously real game of blindman's-
buff, with perhaps a life as the forfeit.

Harold went all over the room, and at last sat down on the edge of
his bed with a hollow suppressed groan that was full of pain.  He had
found his clothes, but realised that they were now but rags.  He put
on the clothes, and then for a long time sat quiet, rocking gently to
and fro as one in pain, a figure of infinite woe.  At last he roused
himself.  His mind was made up; the time for action had come.  He
groped his way towards the window looking south.  The Doctor, who had
taken off his shoes, followed him with catlike stealthiness.

He easily threw open the window, for it was already partly open for
ventilation.

When Mr. Hilton saw him sit on the rail of the balcony and begin to
raise his feet, getting ready to drop over, he rushed forward and
seized him.  Harold instinctively grappled with him; the habit of his
Alaskan life amidst continual danger made in such a case action swift
as thought.  Mr. Hilton, with the single desire to prevent him from
killing himself, threw himself backward and pulled Harold with him to
the stone floor.

Harold, as he held him in a grip of iron, thundered out, forgetful in
the excitement of the moment the hushed voice to which he had limited
himself:

'What do you want? who are you?'

'H-s-s-sh!  I am Mr. Hilton.'  Harold relaxed the rigour of his grasp
but still held him firmly:

'How did you come here?  I locked my door!'

'I have been in the room a long time.  I suspected something, and
came to watch; to prevent your rash act.'

'Rash act!  How?'

'Why, man, if you didn't kill, you would at least cripple yourself.'

'How can I cripple myself when the flower-bed is only a few feet
below?'

'There are other dangers for a man who--a man in your sad state.
And, besides, have I no duty to prevent a suicide!'  Here a brilliant
idea struck Harold.  This man had evidently got some wrong
impression; but it would serve to shield his real purpose.  He would
therefore encourage it.  For the moment, of course, his purpose to
escape unnoticed was foiled; but he would wait, and in due time seize
another opportunity.  In a harder and more determined tone than he
had yet used he said:

'I don't see what right you have to interfere.  I shall kill myself
if I like.'

'Not whilst you are in my care!'  This was spoken with a resolution
equal to his own.  Then Mr. Hilton went on, more softly and with
infinite compassion:  'Moreover, I want to have a talk with you which
may alter your views.'  Harold interrupted, still playing the game of
hiding his real purpose:

'I shall do as I wish; as I intend.'

'You are injuring yourself even now by standing in the draught of
that open window.  Your eyes will feel it before long . . . Are you
mad . . . ?'

Harold felt a prick like a pin in his neck; and turned to seize his
companion.  He could not find him, and for a few moments stumbled
through the dark, raging . . .

It seemed a long time before he remembered anything.  He had a sense
of time lapsed; of dreamland thoughts and visions.  Then gradually
recollection came back.  He tried to move; but found it impossible.
His arms and legs were extended wide and were tied; he could feel the
cord hurting his wrists and ankles as he moved.  To him it was awful
to be thus blind and helpless; and anger began to surge up.  He heard
the voice of Mr. Hilton close by him speaking in a calm, grave,
sympathetic tone:

'My poor fellow, I hated to take such a step; but it was really
necessary for your own safety.  You are a man, and a brave one.
Won't you listen to me for a few minutes?  When you have heard what I
have to say I shall release you.  In the meantime I apologise for the
outrage, as I dare say you consider it!'  Harold was reasonable; and
he was now blind and helpless.  Moreover, there was something in the
Doctor's voice that carried a sense of power with it.

'Go on! I shall listen!'  He compelled himself to quietude.  The
Doctor saw, and realised that he was master of himself.  There were
some snips of scissors, and he was free.

'See! all I want is calm for a short time, and you have it.  May I go
on?'

'Go on!' said Harold, not without respect.  The Doctor after a pause
spoke:

'My poor fellow, I want you to understand that I wish to help you, to
do all in my power to restore to you that which you seem to have
lost!  I can sympathise with your desire to quit life altogether now
that the best part of it, sight, seems gone.  I do not pretend to
judge the actions of my fellows; and if you determine to carry out
your purpose I shall not be able to prevent you for ever.  I shall
not try to.  But you certainly shall not do so till you know what I
know!  I had wished to wait till I could be a little more certain
before I took you into confidence with regard to my guessing as to
the future.  But your desire to destroy yourself forces my hand.  Now
let me tell you that there is a possibility of the removal of the
cause of your purpose.'

'What do you mean?' gasped Harold.  He was afraid to think outright
and to the full what the other's words seemed to imply.

'I mean,' said the other solemnly, 'that there is a possibility, more
than a possibility, that you may recover your sight!'  As he spoke
there was a little break in his voice.  He too was somewhat unnerved
at the situation.

Harold lay still.  The whole universe seemed to sway, and then whirl
round him in chaotic mass.  Through it at length he seemed to hear
the calm voice:

'At first I could not be sure of my surmise, for when I used the
ophthalmoscope your suffering was too recent to disclose the cause I
looked for.  Now I am fairly sure of it.  What I have since heard
from you has convinced me; your having suffered from rheumatic fever,
and the recrudescence of the rheumatic pain after your terrible
experience of the fire and that long chilling swim with so seemingly
hopeless an end to it; the symptoms which I have since noticed,
though they have not been as enlightening to me as they might be.
Your disease, as I have diagnosed it, is an obscure one and not
common.  I have not before been able to study a case.  All these
things give me great hopes.'

'Thank God!  Thank God!' the voice from the bed was now a whisper.

'Thank God! say I too.  This that you suffer from is an acute form of
inflammation of the optic nerve.  It may of course end badly; in
permanent loss of sight.  But I hope--I believe, that in your case it
will not be so.  You are young, and you are immensely strong; not
merely muscularly, but in constitution.  I can see that you have been
an athlete, and no mean one either.  All this will stand to you.  But
it will take time.  It will need all your own help; all the calm
restraint of your body and your mind.  I am doing all that science
knows; you must do the rest!'  He waited, giving time to the other to
realise his ideas.  Harold lay still for a long time before he spoke:

'Doctor.'  The voice was so strangely different that the other was
more hopeful at once.  He had feared opposition, or conflict of some
kind.  He answered as cheerily as he could:

'Yes!  I am listening.'

'You are a good fellow; and I am grateful to you, both for what you
have done and what you have told me.  I cannot say how grateful just
yet; hope unmans me at present.  But I think you deserve that I
should tell you the truth!'  The other nodded; he forgot that the
speaker could not see.

'I was not intending to commit suicide.  Such an idea didn't even
enter my head.  To me, suicide is the resource of a coward.  I have
been in too many tight places to ever fear that.'

'Then in the name of goodness why were you trying to get out of that
window?'

'I wanted to escape; to get away!'

'In your shirt and trousers; and they are not over much!  Without
even slippers!'  A faint smile curled round the lips of the injured
man.  Hope was beginning to help already.

'Even that way!'

'But man alive! you were going to your death.  How could you expect
to get away in such an outfit without being discovered?  When you
were missed the whole countryside would have been up, and even before
the hue-and-cry the first person who saw you would have taken charge
of you.'

'I know!  I know!  I had thought of it all.  But I was willing to
chance it.  I had my own reasons!'  He was silent a while.  The
Doctor was silent too.  Each man was thinking in his own way.
Presently the Doctor spoke:

'Look here, old chap!  I don't want to pry into your secrets; but,
won't you let me help you?  I can hold my tongue.  I want to help
you.  You have earned that wish from any man, and woman too, who saw
the burning ship and what you did to save those on board.  There is
nothing I would not do for you.  Nothing!  I don't ask you to tell me
all; only enough for me to understand and help.  I can see that you
have some overpowering wish to get away.  Some reason that I cannot
fathom, certainly without a clue.  You may trust me, I assure you.
If you could look into my face, my eyes, you would understand.  But--
There! take my hand.  It may tell you something!'

Harold took the hand placed in his, and held it close.  He pressed
his other hand over it also, as though the effect of the two hands
would bring him double knowledge.  It was infinitely pathetic to see
him trying to make his untrained fingers do the duty of his trained
eyes.  But, trained or not, his hands had their instinct.  Laying
down gently the hand he held he said, turning his bandaged eyes in
the direction of his companion:

'I shall trust you!  Are we alone; absolutely alone?'

'Absolutely!'

'Have I your solemn promise that anything I say shall never go beyond
yourself?'

'I promise.  I can swear, if it will make your mind more easy in the
matter.'

'What do you hold most sacred in the world?'  Harold had an odd
thought; his question was its result.

'All told, I should think my profession!  Perhaps it doesn't seem to
you much to swear by; but it is all my world!  But I have been
brought up in honour, and you may trust my promise--as much as
anything I could swear.'

'All right!  My reason for wanting to get away was because I knew
Lady de Lannoy!'

'What!'  Then after a pause:  'I should have thought that was a
reason for wanting to stay.  She seems not only one of the most
beautiful, but the sweetest woman I ever met.'

'She is all that!  And a thousand times more!'

'Then why-- Pardon me!'

'I cannot tell you all; but you must take it that my need to get away
is imperative.'  After pondering a while Mr. Hilton said suddenly:

'I must ask your pardon again.  Are you sure there is no mistake.
Lady de Lannoy is not married; has not been.  She is Countess in her
own right.  It is quite a romance.  She inherited from some old
branch of more than three hundred years ago.'  Again Harold smiled;
he quite saw what the other meant.

He answered gravely

'I understand.  But it does not alter my opinion; my purpose.  It is
needful--absolutely and imperatively needful that I get away without
her recognising me, or knowing who I am.'

'She does not know you now.  She has not seen you yet.'

'That is why I hoped to get away in time; before she should recognise
me.  If I stay quiet and do all you wish, will you help me?'

'I will!  And what then?'

'When I am well, if it should be so, I shall steal away, this time
clothed, and disappear out of her life without her knowing.  She may
think it ungrateful that one whom she has treated so well should
behave so badly.  But that can't be helped.  It is the lesser evil of
the two.'

'And I must abet you?  All right!  I will do it; though you must
forgive me if you should ever hear that I have abused you and said
bad things of you.  It will have to be all in the day's work if I am
not ultimately to give you away.  I must take steps at once to keep
her from seeing you.  I shall have to invent some story; some new
kind of dangerous disease, perhaps.  I shall stay here and nurse you
myself!'  Harold spoke in joyful gratitude:

'Oh, you ARE good.  But can you spare the time?  How long will it all
take?'

'Some weeks!  Perhaps!'  He paused as if thinking.  'Perhaps in a
month's time I shall unbandage your eyes.  You will then see; or . .
. '

'I understand!  I shall be patient!'

In the morning Mr. Hilton in reporting to Lady de Lannoy told her
that he considered it would be necessary to keep his patient very
quiet, both in mind and body.  In the course of the conversation he
said:

'Anything which might upset him must be studiously avoided.  He is
not an easy patient to deal with; he doesn't like people to go near
him.  I think, therefore, it will be well if even you do not see him.
He seems to have an odd distrust of people, especially of women.  It
may be that he is fretful in his blindness, which is in itself so
trying to a strong man.  But besides, the treatment is not calculated
to have a very buoyant effect.  It is apt to make a man fretful to
lie in the dark, and know that he has to do so for indefinite weeks.
Pilocarpin, and salicylate of soda, and mercury do not tend towards
cheerfulness.  Nor do blisters on the forehead add to the content of
life!'

'I quite understand,' said Stephen, 'and I will be careful not to go
near him till he is well.  Please God! it may bring him back his
sight.  Thank you a thousand times for your determination to stay
with him.'

So it was that for more than two weeks Harold was kept all alone.  No
one attended him but the Doctor.  He slept in the patient's room for
the whole of the first week, and never had him out of sight for more
than a few minutes at a time.  He was then able to leave him alone
for longer periods, and settled himself in the bedroom next to him.
Every hour or two he would visit him.  Occasionally he would be away
for half a day, but never for more.  Stephen rigidly observed the
Doctor's advice herself, and gave strict orders that his instructions
were to be obeyed.

Harold himself went through a period of mental suffering.  It was
agony to him to think of Stephen being so near at hand, and yet not
to be able to see her, or even to hear her voice.  All the pain of
his loss of her affection seemed to crowd back on him, and with it
the new need of escaping from her unknown.  More than ever he felt it
would not do that she should ever learn his identity.  Her pity for
him, and possibly her woman's regard for a man's effort in time of
stress, might lead through the gates of her own self-sacrifice to his
restoration to his old place in her affections.  Nay! it could not be
his old place; for at the close of those days she had learned of his
love for her.



CHAPTER XXXV--A CRY



The third week had nearly elapsed, and as yet no one was allowed to
see the patient.

For a time Stephen was inclined to be chagrined.  It is not pleasant
to have even the most generous and benevolent intentions thwarted;
and she had set her mind on making much of this man whom fate and his
own bravery had thrown athwart her life.  But in these days Stephen
was in some ways a changed woman.  She had so much that she wished to
forget and that she would have given worlds to recall, that she could
not bear even to think of any militant or even questioning attitude.
She even began to take herself to task more seriously than she had
ever done with regard to social and conventional duties.  When she
found her house full of so many and so varied guests, it was borne in
upon her that such a position as her own, with such consequent
duties, called for the presence of some elder person of her own sex
and of her own class.

No better proof of Stephen's intellectual process and its result
could be adduced than her first act of recognition:  she summoned an
elderly lady to live with her and matronise her house.  This lady,
the widow of a distant relation, complied with all the charted
requirements of respectability, and had what to Stephen's eyes was a
positive gift:  that of minding her own business and not interfering
in any matter whatever.  Lady de Lannoy, she felt, was her own master
and quite able to take care of herself.  Her own presence was all
that convention required.  So she limited herself to this duty, with
admirable result to all, herself included.  After a few days Stephen
would almost forget that she was present.

Mr. Hilton kept bravely to his undertaking.  He never gave even a
hint of his hopes of the restoration of sight; and he was so
assiduous in his attention that there arose no opportunity of
accidental discovery of the secret.  He knew that when the time did
come he would find himself in a very unpleasant situation.  Want of
confidence, and even of intentional deceit, might be attributed to
him; and he would not be able to deny nor explain.  He was, however;
determined to stick to his word.  If he could but save his patient's
sight he would be satisfied.

But to Stephen all the mystery seemed to grow out of its first
shadowy importance into something real.  There was coming to her a
vague idea that she would do well not to manifest any concern, any
anxiety, any curiosity.  Instinct was at work; she was content to
trust it, and wait.

One forenoon she received by messenger a letter which interested her
much.  So much that at first she was unwilling to show it to anyone,
and took it to her own boudoir to read over again in privacy.  She
had a sort of feeling of expectancy with regard to it; such as
sensitive natures feel before a thunderstorm.  The letter was natural
enough in itself.  It was dated that morning from Varilands, a
neighbouring estate which marched with Lannoy to the south.


'My Dear Madam,--Will you pardon me a great liberty, and allow my
little girl and me to come to see you to-day?  I shall explain when
we meet.  When I say that we are Americans and have come seven
thousand miles for the purpose, you will, I am sure, understand that
it is no common interest which has brought us, and it will be the
excuse for our eagerness.  I should write you more fully, but as the
matter is a confidential one I thought it would be better to speak.
We shall be doubly grateful if you will have the kindness to see us
alone.  I write as a mother in making this appeal to your kindness;
for my child--she is only a little over eight years old--has the
matter so deeply in her heart that any disappointment or undue delay
would I fear affect her health.  We presume to take your kindness for
granted and will call a little before twelve o'clock.

'I may perhaps say (in case you should feel any hesitation as to my
bona fides) that my husband purchased some years ago this estate.  We
were to have come here to live in the early summer, but were kept in
the West by some important business of his.

'Believe me, yours sincerely,

'ALICE STONEHOUSE.'


Stephen had, of course, no hesitation as to receiving the lady.  Even
had there been objection, the curiosity she had in common with her
kind would have swept difficulties aside.  She gave orders that when
Mrs. Stonehouse arrived with her daughter they were to be shown at
once into the Mandarin drawing-room.  That they would probably stay
for lunch.  She would see them alone.

A little before twelve o'clock Mrs. Stonehouse and Pearl arrived, and
were shown into the room where Lady de Lannoy awaited them.  The high
sun, streaming in from the side, shone on her beautiful hair, making
it look like living gold.  When the Americans came in they were for
an instant entranced by her beauty.  One glance at Mrs. Stonehouse's
sweet sympathetic face was enough to establish her in Stephen's good
graces forever.  As for Pearl, she was like one who has unexpectedly
seen a fairy or a goddess.  She had been keeping guardedly behind her
mother, but on the instant she came out fearlessly into the open.

Stephen advanced quickly and shook hands with Mrs. Stonehouse, saying
heartily:

'I am so glad you have come.  I am honoured in being trusted.'

'Thank you so much, Lady de Lannoy.  I felt that you would not mind,
especially when you know why we came.  Indeed I had no choice.  Pearl
insisted on it; and when Pearl is urgent--we who love her have all to
give way.  This is Pearl!'

In an instant Stephen was on her knees by the beautiful child.

The red rosebud of a mouth was raised to her kiss, and the little
arms went lovingly round her neck and clung to her.  As the mother
looked on delighted she thought she had never seen a more beautiful
sight.  The two faces so different, and yet with so much in common.
The red hair and the flaxen, both tints of gold.  The fine colour of
each heightened to a bright flush in their eagerness.  Stephen was so
little used to children, and yet loved them so, that all the
womanhood in her, which is possible motherhood, went out in an
instant to the lovely eager child.  She felt the keenest pleasure
when the little thing, having rubbed her silk-gloved palms over her
face, and then holding her away so that she could see her many
beauties, whispered in her ear:

'How pretty you are!'

'You darling!' whispered Stephen in reply.  'We must love each other
very much, you and I!'

When the two ladies had sat down, Stephen holding Pearl in her lap,
Mrs. Stonehouse said:

'I suppose you have wondered, Lady de Lannoy, what has brought us
here?'

'Indeed I was very much interested.'

'Then I had better tell you all from the beginning so that you may
understand.'  She proceeded to give the details of the meeting with
Mr. Robinson on the Scoriac.  Of how Pearl took to him and insisted
on making him her special friend; of the terrible incident of her
being swept overboard, and of the gallant rescue.  Mrs. Stonehouse
was much moved as she spoke.  All that fearful time, of which the
minutes had seemed years of agony, came back to her so vividly at
times that she could hardly speak.  Pearl listened too; all
eagerness, but without fear.  Stephen was greatly moved and held
Pearl close to her all the time, as though protecting her.  When the
mother spoke of her feeling when she saw the brave man struggling up
and down the giant waves, and now and again losing sight of him in
the trough of the sea, she put out one hand and held the mother's
with a grasp which vibrated in sympathy, whilst the great tears
welled over in her eyes and ran down her cheeks.  Pearl, watching her
keenly, said nothing, but taking her tiny cambric handkerchief from
her pocket silently wiped the tears away, and clung all the tighter.
It was her turn to protect now!

Pearl's own time for tears came when her mother began to tell this
new and sympathetic friend of how she became so much attached to her
rescuer that when she knew he would not be coming to the West with
them, but going off to the wildest region of the far North, her
health became impaired; and that it was only when Mr. Robinson
promised to come back to see her within three years that she was at
all comforted.  And how, ever since, she had held the man in her
heart and thought of him every day; sleeping as well as waking, for
he was a factor in her dreams!

Stephen was more than ever moved, for the child's constancy touched
her as well as her grief.  She strained the little thing in her
strong young arms, as though the fervency of her grasp would bring
belief and comfort; as it did.  She in her turn dried the others'
eyes.  Then Mrs. Stonehouse went on with her story:

'We were at Banff, high up in the Rockies, when we read of the
burning and wrecking of the Dominion.  It is, as you know, a Montreal
boat of the Allan Line; so that naturally there was a full
telegraphic report in all the Canadian papers.  When we read of the
brave man who swam ashore with the line and who was unable to reach
the port but swam out across the bay, Pearl took it for granted that
it must have been ""The Man,"" as she always called Mr. Robinson.  When
by the next paper we learned that the man's name WAS Robinson nothing
would convince her that it was not HER Mr. Robinson.  My husband, I
may tell you, had firmly come to the same conclusion.  He had ever
since the rescue of our child always looked for any news from Alaska,
whither he knew Mr. Robinson had gone.  He learned that up away in
the very far North a new goldfield had been discovered by a man of
the same name; and that a new town, Robinson City, began to grow up
in the wilderness, where the condition of life from the cold was a
new experience to even the most hardy gold miners.  Then we began to
think that the young hero who had so gallantly saved our darling was
meeting some of his reward . . . !'

She paused, her voice breaking.  Stephen was in a glow of holy
feeling.  Gladness, joy, gratitude, enthusiasm; she knew not which.
It all seemed like a noble dream which was coming true.  Mrs.
Stonehouse went on:-

'From Californian papers of last month we learned that Robinson, of
Robinson City, had sailed for San Francisco, but had disappeared when
the ship touched at Portland; and then the whole chain of his
identity seemed complete.  Nothing would satisfy Pearl but that we
should come at once to England and see ""The Man,"" who was wounded and
blind, and do what we could for him.  Her father could not then come
himself; he had important work on hand which he could not leave
without some preparation.  But he is following us and may be here at
any time.

'And now, we want you to help us, Lady de Lannoy.  We are not sure
yet of the identity of Mr. Robinson, but we shall know the instant we
see him, or hear his voice.  We have learned that he is still here.
Won't you let us?  Do let us see him as soon as ever you can!'  There
was a pleading tone in her voice which alone would have moved
Stephen, even had she not been wrought up already by the glowing
fervour of her new friend.

But she paused.  She did not know what to say; how to tell them that
as yet she herself knew nothing.  She, too, in the depths of her own
heart knew--KNEW--that it was the same Robinson.  And she also knew
that both identities were one with another.  The beating of her heart
and the wild surging of her blood told her all.  She was afraid to
speak lest her voice should betray her.

She could not even think.  She would have to be alone for that.

Mrs. Stonehouse, with the wisdom and power of age, waited, suspending
judgment.  But Pearl was in a fever of anxiety; she could imagine
nothing which could keep her away from The Man.  But she saw that
there was some difficulty, some cause of delay.  So she too added her
pleading.  Putting her mouth close to Lady de Lannoy's ear she
whispered very faintly, very caressingly:

'What is your name?  Your own name?  Your very own name?'

'Stephen, my darling!'

'Oh, won't you let us see The Man, Stephen; dear Stephen!  I love him
so; and I do SO want to see him.  It is ages till I see him!  Won't
you let me?  I shall be so good--Stephen!'  And she strained her
closer in her little arms and kissed her all over face, cheeks and
forehead and eyes and mouth wooingly.  Stephen returned the embrace
and the kisses, but remained silent a little longer.  Then she found
voice:

'I hardly know what to say.  Believe me, I should--I shall, do all I
can; but the fact is that I am not in authority.  The Doctor has
taken him in charge and will not let anyone go near him:  He will not
even have a nurse, but watches and attends to him himself.  He says
it might be fatal if anything should occur to agitate him.  Why, even
I am not allowed to see him!'

'Haven't you seen him yet at all; ever, ever, Stephen?' asked Pearl,
all her timidity gone.  Stephen smiled--a wan smile it was, as she
answered:

'I saw him in the water, but it was too far away to distinguish.  And
it was only by firelight.'

'Oh yes, I know,' said Pearl; 'Mother and Daddy told me how you had
burned the house down to give him light.  Didn't you want to see him
more after that?  I should!'  Stephen drew the impulsive child closer
as she answered:

'Indeed I did, dear.  But I had to think of what was good for him.  I
went to his room the next day when he was awake, and the Doctor let
me come in for only a moment.'

'Well!  What did you see.  Didn't you know him?'  She forgot that the
other did not know him from her point of view.  But the question went
through Stephen's heart like a sword.  What would she not have given
to have known him!  What would she not give to know him now! . . .
She spoke mechanically:

'The room was quite dark.  It is necessary, the Doctor says, that he
be kept in the dark.  I saw only a big beard, partly burned away by
the fire; and a great bandage which covered his eyes!'  Pearl's hold
relaxed, she slipped like an eel to the floor and ran over to her
mother.  Her new friend was all very well, but no one would do as
well as mother when she was in trouble.

'Oh mother, mother!  My Robinson had no beard!'  Her mother stroked
her face comfortingly as she answered:

'But, my dear, it is more than two years since you saw him.  Two
years and three months, for it was in June that we crossed.'  How the
date thrilled Stephen.  It verified her assumption.

Mrs. Stonehouse did not notice, but went on:

'His beard would have grown.  Men wear beards up in the cold place
where he was.'  Pearl kissed her; there was no need for words.
Throwing herself again on Stephen's knees she went on with her
questioning:

'But didn't you hear him?'

'I heard very little, darling.  He was very weak.  It was only the
morning after the wreck, and he spoke in a whisper!'  Then with an
instinct of self-preservation she added:  'But how could I learn
anything by hearing him when he was a stranger to me?  I had never
even heard of Mr. Robinson!'

As she was speaking she found her own ideas, the proofs of her own
conviction growing.  This was surely another link in the chain of
proving that all three men were but one.  But in such case Harold
must know; must have tried to hide his identity!

She feared, with keen eyes upon her, to pursue the thought.  But her
blood began to grow cold and her brain to swim.  With an effort she
went on:

'Even since then I have not been allowed to go near him.  Of course I
must obey orders.  I am waiting as patiently as I can.  But we must
ask the Doctor if he thinks his patient will see you--will let you
see him--though he will not let me.'  This she added with a touch of
what she felt:  regret rather than bitter ness.  There was no room
for bitterness in her full heart where Harold was concerned.

'Will you ask the Doctor now?'  Pearl did not let grass grow under
her feet.  For answer Stephen rang the bell, and when a servant
appeared asked:

'Is Mr. Hilton in the house?'

'I think not, your Ladyship.  He said he was going over to Port
Lannoch.  Shall I inquire if he left word at what time he would be
back?'

'If you please!'  The man returned in a few minutes with the butler,
who said:

'Mr. Hilton said, your Ladyship, that he expected to be back by one
o'clock at latest.'

'Please ask him on his arrival if he will kindly come here at once.
Do not let us be disturbed until then.'  The butler bowed and
withdrew.

'Now,' said Stephen, 'as we have to wait till our tyrant comes, won't
you tell me all that went on after The Man had left you?'  Pearl
brightened up at once.  Stephen would have given anything to get away
even for a while.  Beliefs and hopes and fears were surging up, till
she felt choking.  But the habit of her life, especially her life of
the last two years, gave her self-control.  And so she waited, trying
with all her might to follow the child's prattle.

After a long wait Pearl exclaimed:  'Oh!  I do wish that Doctor would
come.  I want to see The Man!'  She was so restless, marching about
the room, that Stephen said:

'Would you like to go out on the balcony, darling; of course if
Mother will let you?  It is quite safe, I assure you, Mrs.
Stonehouse.  It is wide and open and is just above the flower-
borders, with a stone tail.  You can see the road from it by which
Mr. Hilton comes from Port Lannoch.  He will be riding.'  Pearl
yielded at once to the diversion.  It would at any rate be something
to do, to watch.  Stephen opened the French window and the child ran
out on the balcony.

When Stephen came back to her seat Mrs. Stonehouse said quietly:

'I am glad she is away for a few minutes.  She has been over wrought,
and I am always afraid for her.  She is so sensitive.  And after all
she is only a baby!'

'She is a darling!' said Stephen impulsively; and she meant it.  Mrs.
Stonehouse smiled gratefully as she went on:

'I suppose you noticed what a hold on her imagination that episode of
Mollie Watford at the bank had.  Mr. Stonehouse is, as perhaps you
know, a very rich man.  He has made his fortune himself, and most
honourably; and we are all very proud of him, and of it.  So Pearl
does not think of the money for itself.  But the feeling was
everything; she really loves Mr. Robinson; as indeed she ought!  He
has done so much for us that it would be a pride and a privilege for
us to show our gratitude.  My husband, between ourselves, wanted to
make him his partner.  He tells me that, quite independent of our
feeling towards him, he is just the man he wanted.  And if indeed it
was he who discovered the Alaskan goldfield and organised and ruled
Robinson City, it is a proof that Mr. Stonehouse's judgment was
sound.  Now he is injured, and blind; and our little Pearl loves him.
If indeed he be the man we believe he is, then we may be able to do
something which all his millions cannot buy.  He will come to us, and
be as a son to us, and a brother to Pearl.  We will be his eyes; and
nothing but love and patience will guide his footsteps!'  She paused,
her mouth quivering; then she went on:

'If it is not our Mr. Robinson, then it will be our pleasure to do
all that is necessary for his comfort.  If he is a poor man he will
never want . . . It will be a privilege to save so gallant a man from
hardship . . . '  Here she came to a stop.

Stephen too was glad of the pause, for the emotion which the words
and their remembrances evoked was choking her.  Had not Harold been
as her own father's son.  As her own brother! . . . She turned away,
fearing lest her face should betray her.

All at once Mrs. Stonehouse started to her feet, her face suddenly
white with fear; for a cry had come to their ears.  A cry which even
Stephen knew as Pearl's.  The mother ran to the window.

The balcony was empty.  She came back into the room, and' ran to the
door.

But on the instant a voice that both women knew was heard from
without:

'Help there!  Help, I say!  The child has fainted.  Is there no one
there?  And I am blind!'



CHAPTER XXXVI--LIGHT



Harold had been in a state of increasing restlessness.  The month of
waiting which Dr. Hilton had laid down for him seemed to wear away
with extraordinary slowness; this was increased by the lack of
companionship, and further by the cutting off of even the little
episodes usual to daily life.  His patience, great as it was
naturally and trained as it had been by the years of self-repression,
was beginning to give way.  Often and often there came over him a
wild desire to tear off the irksome bandages and try for himself
whether the hopes held out to him were being even partially
justified.  He was restrained only by the fear of perpetual
blindness, which came over him in a sort of cold wave at each
reaction.  Time, too, added to his fear of discovery; but he could
not but think that his self-sought isolation must be a challenge to
the curiosity of each and all who knew of it.  And with all these
disturbing causes came the main one, which never lessened but always
grew:  that whatever might happen Stephen would be further from him
than ever.  Look at the matter how he would; turn it round in
whatsoever possible or impossible way, he could see no relief to this
gloomy conclusion.

For it is in the nature of love that it creates or enlarges its own
pain.  If troubles or difficulties there be from natural causes, then
it will exaggerate them into nightmare proportions.  But if there be
none, it will create them.  Love is in fact the most serious thing
that comes to man; where it exists all else seem as phantoms, or at
best as actualities of lesser degree.  During the better part of two
years his troubles had but slept; and as nothing wakes the pangs of
old love better than the sound of a voice, all the old acute pain of
love and the agony that followed its denial were back with him.
Surely he could never, never believe that Stephen did not mean what
she had said to him that morning in the beech grove.  All his new
resolution not to hamper her with the burden of a blind and lonely-
hearted man was back to the full.

In such mood had he been that morning.  He was additionally disturbed
because the Doctor had gone early to Port Lannoch; and as he was the
only person with whom he could talk, he clung to him with something
of the helpless feeling of a frightened child to its nurse.

The day being full of sunshine the window was open, and only the
dark-green blind which crackled and rustled with every passing breeze
made the darkness of the room.  Harold was dressed and lay on a sofa
placed back in the room, where the few rays of light thus entering
could not reach him.  His eyes and forehead were bandaged as ever.
For some days the Doctor, who had his own reasons and his own
purpose, had not taken them off; so the feeling of blind helplessness
was doubly upon him.  He knew he was blind; and he knew also that if
he were not he could not in his present condition see.

All at once he started up awake.  His hearing had in the weeks of
darkness grown abnormally acute, and some trifling sound had recalled
him to himself.  It might have been inspiration, but he seemed to be
conscious of some presence in the room.

As he rose from the sofa, with the violent motion of a strong man
startled into unconscious activity, he sent a shock of fear to the
eager child who had strayed into the room through the open window.
Had he presented a normal appearance, she would not have been
frightened.  She would have recognised his identity despite the
changes, and have sprung to him so impulsively that she would have
been in his arms before she had time to think.  But now all she saw
was a great beard topped with a mass of linen and lint, which
obscured all the rest of the face and seemed in the gloom like a
gigantic and ominous turban.

In her fright she screamed out.  He in turn, forgetful for the moment
of his intention of silence, called aloud:

'Who is that?'  Pearl, who had been instinctively backing towards the
window by which she had entered, and whose thoughts in her fright had
gone back to her mother--refuge in time of danger--cried out:

'Mother, Mother!  It is him!  It is The Man!'  She would have run
towards him in spite of his forbidding appearance; but the shock had
been too much for her.  The little knees trembled and gave way; the
brain reeled; and with a moan she sank on the floor in a swoon.

Harold knew the voice the instant she spoke; there was no need for
the enlightening words

'Pearl!  Pearl!' he cried.  'Come to me, darling!'  But as he spoke
he heard her moan, and the soft thud of her little body on the thick
carpet.  He guessed the truth and groped his way towards where the
sound had been, for he feared lest he might trample upon her in too
great eagerness.  Kneeling by her he touched her little feet, and
then felt his way to her face.  And as he did so, such is the double
action of the mind, even in the midst of his care the remembrance
swept across his mind of how he had once knelt in just such manner in
an old church by another little senseless form.  In his confusion of
mind he lost the direction of the door, and coming to the window
pushed forward the flapping blind and went out on the balcony.  He
knew from the freshness of the air and the distant sounds that he was
in the open.  This disturbed him, as he wished to find someone who
could attend to the fainting child.  But as he had lost the way back
to the room now, he groped along the wall of the Castle with one
hand, whilst he held Pearl securely in the other.  As he went he
called out for help.

When he came opposite the window of the Mandarin room Mrs. Stonehouse
saw him; she ran to him and caught Pearl in her arms.  She was so
agitated, so lost in concern for the child that she never even
thought to speak to the man whom she had come so far to seek.  She
wailed over the child:

'Pearl!  Pearl!  What is it, darling?  It is Mother!'  She laid the
girl on the sofa, and taking the flowers out of a glass began to
sprinkle water on the child's face.  Harold knew her voice and waited
in patience.  Presently the child sighed; the mother, relieved,
thought of other things at last and looked around her.

There was yet another trouble.  There on the floor, where she had
slipped down, lay Lady de Lannoy in a swoon.  She called out
instinctively, forgetting for the moment that the man was blind, but
feeling all the old confidence which he had won in her heart:

'Oh!  Mr. Robinson, help me!  Lady de Lannoy has fainted too, and I
do not know what to do!'  As she spoke she looked up at him and
remembered his blindness.  But she had no time to alter her words;
the instant she had spoken Harold, who had been leaning against the
window-sash, and whose mind was calmer since with his acute hearing
he too had heard Pearl sigh, seemed to leap into the room.

'Where is she?  Where is she?  Oh, God, now am I blind indeed!'

It gave her a pang to hear him and to see him turn helplessly with
his arms and hands outstretched as though he would feel for her in
the air.

Without pause, and under an instinctive and uncontrollable impulse,
he tore the bandages from his eyes.  The sun was streaming in.  As he
met it his eyes blinked and a cry burst from him; a wild cry whose
joy and surprise pierced even through the shut portals of the
swooning woman's brain.  Not for worlds would she ever after have
lost the memory of that sound:

'Light! light!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  I am not blind!'

But he looked round him still in terrified wonder:

'Where is she?  Where is she?  I cannot see her!  Stephen!  Stephen!
where are you?'  Mrs. Stonehouse, bewildered, pointed where Stephen's
snow-white face and brilliant hair seemed in the streaming sunlight
like ivory and gold:

'There!  There!'  He caught her arm mechanically, and putting his
eyes to her wrist, tried to look along her pointed finger.  In an
instant he dropped her arm moaning.

'I cannot see her!  What is it that is over me?  This is worse than
to be blind!'  He covered his face with his hands and sobbed.

He felt light strong fingers on his forehead and hands; fingers whose
touch he would have known had they been laid on him were he no longer
quick.  A voice whose music he had heard in his dreams for two long
years said softly:

'I am here, Harold!  I am here!  Oh! do not sob like that; it breaks
my heart to hear you!'  He took his hands from his face and held hers
in them, staring intently at her as though his passionate gaze would
win through every obstacle.

That moment he never forgot.  Never could forget!  He saw the room
all rich in yellow.  He saw Pearl, pale but glad-eyed, lying on a
sofa holding the hand of her mother, who stood beside her.  He saw
the great high window open, the lines of the covered stone balcony
without, the stretch of green sward all vivid in the sunshine, and
beyond it the blue quivering sea.  He saw all but that for which his
very soul longed; without to see which sight itself was valueless . .
. But still he looked, and looked; and Stephen saw in his dark eyes,
though he could not see her, that which made her own eyes fill and
the warm red glow on her face again . . . Then she raised her eyes
again, and the gladness of her beating heart seemed the answer to his
own.

For as he looked he saw, as though emerging from a mist whose
obscurity melted with each instant, what was to him the one face in
all the world.  He did not think then of its beauty--that would come
later; and besides no beauty of one born of woman could outmatch the
memorised beauty which had so long held his heart.  But that he had
so schooled himself in long months of gloomy despair, he would have
taken her in his arms there and then; and, heedless of the presence
of others, have poured out his full heart to her.

Mrs. Stonehouse saw and understood.  So too Pearl, who though a child
was a woman-child; softly they rose up to steal away.  But Stephen
saw them; her own instincts, too, told her that her hour had not
come.  What she hoped for must come alone!  So she called to her
guests:

'Don't go!  Don't go, Mrs. Stonehouse.  You know now that Harold and
I are old friends, though neither of us knew it--till this moment.
We were brought up as . . . almost as brother and sister.  Pearl,
isn't it lovely to see your friend . . . to see The Man again?'

She was so happy that she could only express herself, with dignity,
through the happiness of others.

Pearl actually shrieked with joy as she rushed across the room and
flung herself into Harold's arms as he stooped to her.  He raised
her; and she kissed him again and again, and put her little hands all
over his face and stroked, very, very gently, his eyes, and said:

'Oh, I am so glad!  And so glad your poor eyes are unbind again!  May
I call you Harold, too?'

'You darling!' was all he could say as he kissed her, and holding her
in one arm went across and shook hands with Mrs. Stonehouse, who
wrung his hand hard.

There was a little awkwardness in the group, for none of them knew
what would be best to do next.  In the midst of it there came a light
knock at the door, and Mr. Hilton entered saying:

'They told me you wished to see me at once--Hulloa!'  He rushed
across the room and took Harold by the shoulders, turning his face to
the light.  He looked in his eyes long and earnestly, the others
holding their breaths.  Presently he said, without relaxing his gaze:

'Did you see mistily at first?'

'Yes.'

'Seeing at the periphery; but the centre being opaque?'

'Yes!  How did you know?  Why, I couldn't see'--see pointing to
Stephen--'Lady de Lannoy; though her face was right in front of me!'

Dr. Hilton took his hands from his patient's shoulders and shook him
warmly by both hands:-

'I am glad, old fellow!  It was worth waiting for, wasn't it?  But I
say, it was a dangerous thing to take off those bandages before I
permitted.  However, it has done no harm!  But it was lucky that I
mistrusted your patience and put the time for the experiment a week
later than I thought necessary . . . What is it?'  He turned from one
to the other questioningly; there was a look on Harold's face that he
did not quite comprehend.

'H-s-h,' said the latter warningly, 'I'll tell you all about it . . .
some time!'

The awkward pause was broken by Pearl, who came to the Doctor and
said:

'I must kiss you, you know.  It was you who saved The Man's eyes.
Stephen has told me how you watched him!'  The Doctor was somewhat
taken aback; as yet he was ignorant of Pearl's existence.  However,
he raised the child in his arms and kissed her, saying:

'Thank you, my dear!  I did all I could.  But he helped much himself;
except at the very last.  Don't you ever go and take off bandages, if
you should ever have the misfortune to have them on, without the
doctor's permission!'  Pearl nodded her head wisely and then wriggled
out of his arms and came again to Harold, looking up at him
protectingly and saying in an old-fashioned way:

'How are you feeling now?  None the worse, I hope, HAROLD!'

The Man lifted her up and kissed her again.  When he set her down she
came over to Lady de Lannoy and held up her arms to be lifted:

'And I must kiss you again too, Stephen!'  If Lady de Lannoy hadn't
loved the sweet little thing already she would have loved her for
that!

The door was opened, and the butler announced:

'Luncheon is served, your Ladyship.'


After a few days Harold went over to Varilands to stay for a while
with the Stonehouses.  Mr. Stonehouse had arrived, and both men were
rejoiced to meet again.  The elder never betrayed by word or sign
that he recognised the identity of the other person of the drama of
whom he had told him and who had come so accidentally into his life;
and the younger was grateful to him for it.  Harold went almost every
day to Lannoy, and sometimes the Stonehouses went with him; at other
times Stephen paid flying visits to Varilands.  She did not make any
effort to detain Harold; she would not for worlds have made a sign
which might influence him.  She was full now of that diffidence which
every woman has who loves.  She felt that she must wait; must wait
even if the waiting lasted to her grave.  She felt, as every woman
does who really loves, that she had found her Master.

And Harold, to whom something of the same diffidence was an old
story, got the idea that her reticence was a part of the same feeling
whose violent expression had sent him out into the wilderness.  And
with the thought came the idea of his duty, implied in her father's
dying trust:  'Give her time! . . . Let her choose!'  For him the
clock seemed to have stopped for two whole years, and he was back at
the time when the guardianship of his boy life was beginning to yield
to the larger and more selfish guardianship of manhood.

Stephen, noticing that he did not come near her as closely as she
felt he might, and not realising his true reason--for when did love
ever realise the true reason of the bashfulness of love?--felt a
chillness which in turn reacted on her own manner.

And so these two ardent souls, who yearned for each other's love and
the full expression of it, seemed as if they might end after all in
drifting apart.  Each thought that their secret was concealed.  But
both secrets were already known to Mrs. Stonehouse, who knew nothing;
and to Mr. Stonehouse, who knew everything.  Even Pearl had her own
ideas, as was once shown in a confidence when they were alone in
Stephen's bedroom after helping her to finish her dressing, just as
Stephen herself had at a similar age helped her Uncle Gilbert.  After
some coy leading up to the subject of pretty dresses, the child
putting her little mouth to the other's ear whispered:

'May I be your bridesmaid, Stephen?'  The woman was taken aback; but
she had to speak at once, for the child's eyes were on her:

'Of course you will, darling.  But I--I may never be married.'

'You!  You must!  I know someone who will make you!'  Stephen's heart
beat hard and rapidly.  The child's talk, though sweet and dear, was
more than embarrassing.  With, however, the desire to play with fire,
which is a part of the nature of women, she answered:

'You have some queer ideas, little one, in that pretty knowledge-box
of yours.'

'Oh! he never told me.  But I know it all the same!  And you know it
too, Stephen!'  This was getting too close to be without danger; so
she tried to divert the thought from herself:

'My darling, you may guess about other people, though I don't say you
ought; but you must not guess about me!'

'All right!' then she held up her arms to be lifted on the other's
knee and said:

'I want to whisper to you!'  Her voice and manner were so full of
feeling that somehow the other was moved.  She bent her head, and
Pearl taking her neck in her little palms, said:

'I thought, oh! long ago, that I would marry him myself.  But you
knew him first . . . And he only saved me . . . But you saved him!' .
. . And then she laid her head down on the throbbing bosom, and
sobbed . . .

And Stephen sobbed too.

Before they left the room, Stephen said to her, very gravely, for the
issue might be one of great concern:

'Of course, Pearl dear, our secrets are all between ourselves!'
Pearl crossed her two forefingers and kissed them.  But she said
nothing; she had sworn!  Stephen went on:

'And, darling, you will remember too that one must never speak or
even think if they can help it about anyone's marrying anyone else
till they say so themselves!  What is it, dear, that you are smiling
at?'

'I know, Stephen!  I musn't take off the bandage till the Doctor says
so!'

Stephen smiled and kissed her.  Hand in hand, Pearl chattering
merrily, they went down to the drawing-room.



CHAPTER XXXVII--GOLDEN SILENCE



Each day that passed seemed to add to the trouble in the heart of
these young people; to widen the difficulty of expressing themselves.
To Stephen, who had accepted the new condition of things and whose
whole nature had bloomed again under the sunshine of hope, it was the
less intolerable.  She had set herself to wait, as had countless
thousands of women before her; and as due proportion will, till the
final cataclysm abolishes earthly unions.  But Harold felt the
growth, both positive and negative, as a new torture; and he began to
feel that he would be unable to go through with it.  In his heart was
the constant struggle of hope; and in opposition to it the seeming
realisation of every new fancy of evil.  That bitter hour, when the
whole of creation was for him turned upside down, was having its sad
effect at last.  Had it not been for that horrid remembrance he would
have come to believe enough in himself to put his future to the test.
He would have made an opportunity at which Stephen and himself would
have with the fires of their mutual love burned away the encircling
mist.  There are times when a single minute of commonsense would turn
sorrow into joy; and yet that minute, our own natures being the
opposing forces, will be allowed to pass.

Those who loved these young people were much concerned about them.
Mrs. Stonehouse took their trouble so much to heart that she spoke to
her husband about it, seriously advising that one or other of them
should make an effort to bring things in the right way for their
happiness.  The woman was sure of the woman's feeling.  It is from
men, not women, that women hide their love.  By side-glances and
unthinking moments women note and learn.  The man knew already, from
his own lips, of the man's passion.  But his lips were sealed by his
loyalty; and he said earnestly:

'My dear, we must not interfere.  Not now, at any rate; we might
cause them great trouble.  I am as sure as you are that they really
love each other.  But they must win happiness by themselves and
through themselves alone.  Otherwise it would never be to them what
it ought to be; what it might be; what it will be!'

So these friends were silent, and the little tragedy developed.
Harold's patience began to give way under the constant strain of
self-suppression.  Stephen tried to hide her love and fear, under the
mask of a gracious calm.  This the other took for indifference.

At last there came an hour which was full of new, hopeless agony to
Stephen.  She heard Harold, in a fragment of conversation, speak to
Mr. Stonehouse of the need of returning to Alaska.  That sounded like
a word of doom.  In her inmost heart she knew that Harold loved her;
and had she been free she would have herself spoken the words which
would have drawn the full truth to them both.  But how could she do
so, having the remembrance of that other episode; when, without the
reality of love, she had declared herself? . . . Oh! the shame of it
. . . The folly! . . . And Harold knew it all!  How could he ever
believe that it was real this time! . . .

By the exercise of that self-restraint which long suffering had
taught her, Stephen so managed to control herself that none of her
guests realised what a blow she had received from a casual word.  She
bore herself gallantly till the last moment.  After the old fashion
of her youth, she had from the Castle steps seen their departure.
Then she took her way to her own room, and locked herself in.  She
did not often, in these days, give way to tears; when she did cry it
was as a luxury, and not from poignant cause.  Her deep emotion was
dry-eyed as of old.  Now, she did not cry, she sat still, her hands
clasped below her knees, with set white face gazing out on the far-
off sea.  For hours she sat there lonely; staring fixedly all the
time, though her thoughts were whirling wildly.  At first she had
some vague purpose, which she hoped might eventually work out into a
plan.  But thought would not come.  Everywhere there was the same
beginning:  a wild, burning desire to let Harold understand her
feeling towards him; to blot out, with the conviction of trust and
love, those bitter moments when in the madness of her overstrung
passion she had heaped such insult upon him.  Everywhere the same
end:  an impasse.  He seemingly could not, would not, understand.
She knew now that the man had diffidences, forbearances, self-
judgments and self-denials which made for the suppression, in what he
considered to be her interest, of his own desires.  This was tragedy
indeed!  Again and again came back the remembrance of that bitter
regret of her Aunt Laetitia, which no happiness and no pain of her
own had ever been able to efface:

'To love; and be helpless!  To wait, and wait, and wait; with heart
all aflame!  To hope, and hope; till time seemed to have passed away,
and all the world to stand still on your hopeless misery!  To know
that a word might open up Heaven; and yet to have to remain mute!  To
keep back the glances that could enlighten, to modulate the tones
that might betray!  To see all you hoped for passing away . . . !'

At last she seemed to understand the true force of pride; which has
in it a thousand forces of its own, positive, negative, restrainful.
Oh! how blind she had been!  How little she had learned from the
miseries that the other woman whom she loved had suffered!  How
unsympathetic she had been; how self-engrossed; how callous to the
sensibilities of others!  And now to her, in her turn, had come the
same suffering; the same galling of the iron fetters of pride, and of
convention which is its original expression!  Must it be that the
very salt of youth must lose its savour, before the joys of youth
could be won!  What, after all, was youth if out of its own inherent
power it must work its own destruction!  If youth was so, why not
then trust the wisdom of age?  If youth could not act for its own
redemption . . .

Here the rudiment of a thought struck her and changed the current of
her reason.  A thought so winged with hope that she dared not even
try to complete it! . . . She thought, and thought till the long
autumn shadows fell around her.  But the misty purpose had become
real.

After dinner she went up alone to the mill.  It was late for a visit,
for the Silver Lady kept early hours.  But she found her friend as
usual in her room, whose windows swept the course of the sun.  Seeing
that her visitor was in a state of mental disturbance such as she had
once before exhibited, she blew out the candles and took the same
seat in the eastern window she had occupied on the night which they
both so well remembered.

Stephen understood both acts, and was grateful afresh.  The darkness
would be a help to her in what she had to say; and the resumption of
the old seat and attitude did away with the awkwardness of new
confidence.  During the weeks that had passed Stephen had kept her
friend informed of the rescue and progress of the injured man.  Since
the discovery of Harold's identity she had allowed her to infer her
feeling towards him.

Shyly she had conveyed her hopes that all the bitter part of the past
might be wiped out.  To the woman who already knew of the love that
had always been, but had only awakened to consciousness in the
absence of its object, a hint was sufficient to build upon.  She had
noticed the gloom that had of late been creeping over the girl's
happiness; and she had been much troubled about it.  But she had
thought it wiser to be silent; she well knew that should unhappily
the time for comfort come, it must be precluded by new and more
explicit confidence.  So she too had been anxiously waiting the
progress of events.  Now; as she put her arms round the girl she said
softly; not in the whisper which implies doubt of some kind, but in
the soft voices which conveys sympathy and trust:

'Tell me, dear child!'

And then in broken words shyly spoken, and spoken in such a way that
the silences were more eloquent than the words, the girl conveyed
what was in her heart.  The other listened, now and again stroking
the beautiful hair.  When all was said, there was a brief pause.  The
Silver Lady spoke no word; but the pressure of her delicate hand
conveyed sympathy.

In but a half-conscious way, in words that came so shrinkingly
through the darkness that they hardly reached the ear bent low to
catch them, came Stephen's murmured thought:

'Oh, if he only knew!  And I can't tell him; I can't! dare not!  I
must not.  How could I dishonour him by bearing myself towards him as
to that other . . . worthless . . . !  Oh! the happy, happy girls,
who have mothers . . . !'  All the muscles of her body seemed to
shrink and collapse, till she was like an inert mass at the Silver
Lady's feet.

But the other understood!

 After a long, long pause; when Stephen's sobbing had died away; when
each muscle of her body had become rigid on its return to normal
calm; the Silver Lady began to talk of other matters, and
conversation became normal.  Stephen's courage seemed somehow to be
restored, and she talked brightly.

Before they parted the Silver Lady made a request.  She said in her
natural voice:

'Couldst thou bring that gallant man who saved so many lives, and to
whom the Lord was so good in the restoration of his sight, to see me?
Thou knowest I have made a resolution not to go forth from this calm
place whilst I may remain.  But I should like to see him before he
returns to that far North where he has done such wonders.  He is
evidently a man of kind heart; perhaps he will not mind coming to see
a lonely woman who is no longer young.  There is much I should like
to ask him of that land of which nothing was known in my own youth.
Perhaps he will not mind seeing me alone.'  Stephen's heart beat
furiously.  She felt suffocating with new hope, for what could be but
good from Harold's meeting with that sweet woman who had already
brought so much comfort into her own life?  She was abashed, and yet
radiant; she seemed to tread on air as she stood beside her friend
saying farewell.  She did not wish to speak.  So the two women kissed
and parted.

It had been arranged that two days hence the Stonehouse party were to
spend the day at Lannoy, coming before lunch and staying the night,
as they wanted in the afternoon to return a visit at some distance to
the north of Lannoy.  Harold was to ride over with them.

When the Varilands party arrived, Stephen told them of Sister Ruth's
wish to see Harold.  Pearl at once proffered a request that she also
should be taken at some other time to see the Silver Lady.  Harold
acquiesced heartily; and it was agreed that some time in the late
afternoon he should pay the visit.  Stephen would bring him.

Strangely enough, she felt no awkwardness, no trepidation, as they
rode up the steep road to the Mill.

When the introduction had been effected, and half an hour had been
consumed in conventional small talk, Stephen, obedience to a look
from the Silver Lady, rose.  She said in they most natural way she
could:

'Now Sister Ruth, I will leave you two alone, if you do not mind.
Harold can tell you all you want to know about Alaska; and perhaps,
if you are very good, he will tell some of his adventures!  Good
afternoon, dear.  I wish you were to be with us to-night; but I know
your rule.  I go for my ride.  Sultan has had no exercise for five
days; and he looked at me quite reproachfully when we met this
morning.  Au revoir, Harold.  We shall meet at dinner!'

When she had gone Harold came back from the door, and stood in the
window looking east.  The Silver Lady came and stood beside him.  She
did not seem to notice his face, but in the mysterious way of women
she watched him keenly.  She wished to satisfy her own mind before
she undertook her self-appointed task.

 Her eyes were turned towards the headland towards which Stephen on
her white Arab was galloping at breakneck speed.  He was too good a
horseman himself, and he knew her prowess on horseback too well to
have any anxiety regarding such a rider at Stephen.  It was not fear,
then, that made his face so white, and his eyes to have such an
illimitable sadness.

The Silver Lady made up her mind.  All her instincts were to trust
him.  She recognised a noble nature, with which truth would be her
surest force.

'Come,' she said, 'sit here, friend; where another friend has often
sat with me.  From this you can see all the coastline, and all that
thou wilt!'  Harold put a chair beside the one she pointed out; and
when she was seated he sat also.  She began at once with a desperate
courage:

'I have wanted much to see thee.  I have heard much of thee, before
thy coming.'  There was something in the tone of her voice which
arrested his attention, and he looked keenly at her.  Here, in the
full light, her face looked sadly white and he noticed that her lips
trembled.  He said with all the kindliness of his nature, for from
the first moment he had seen her he had taken to her, her purity and
earnestness and sweetness appealing to some aspiration within him:

'You are pale!  I fear you are not well!  May I call your maid?  Can
I do anything for you?'  She waved her hand gently:

'Nay!  It is nothing.  It is but the result of a sleepless night and
much thought.'

'Oh!  I wish I had known!  I could have put off my visit; and I could
have come any other time to suit you.'  She smiled gently:

'I fear that would have availed but little.  It was of thy coming
that I was concerned.'  Seeing his look of amazement' she went on
quickly, her voice becoming more steady as she lost sight of herself
in her task:

'Be patient a little with me.  I am an old woman; and until recently
it has been many and many years since the calm which I sought here
has been ruffled.  I had come to believe that for me earthly troubles
were no more.  But there has come into my life a new concern.  I have
heard so much of thee, and before thy coming.'  The recurrence of the
phrase struck him.  He would have asked how such could be, but he
deemed it better to wait.  She went on:

'I have been wishful to ask thy advice.  But why should not I tell
thee outright that which troubles me?  I am not used, at least for
these many years, to dissemble.  I can but trust thee in all; and
lean on thy man's mercy to understand, and to aid me!'

'I shall do all in my power, believe me!' said Harold simply.  'Speak
freely!'  She pointed out of the window, where Stephen's white horse
seemed on the mighty sweep of green sward like a little dot.

'It is of her that I would speak to thee!'  Harold's heart began to
beat hard; he felt that something was coming.  The Silver Lady went
on:

'Why thinkest thou that she rideth at such speed?  It is her habit!'
He waited.  She continued:

'Doth it not seem to thee that such reckless movement is the result
of much trouble; that she seeketh forgetfulness?'  He knew that she
was speaking truly; and somehow the conviction was borne upon him
that she knew his secret heart, and was appealing to it.  If it was
about Stephen!  If her disquiet was about her; then God bless her!
He would be patient and grateful.  The Quaker's voice seemed to come
through his thought, as though she had continued speaking whilst he
had paused:

'We have all our own secrets.  I have had mine; and I doubt not that
thou hast had, may still have, thine own.  Stephen hath hers!  May I
speak to thee of her?'

'I shall be proud!  Oh! madam, I thank you with all my heart for your
sweet kindness to her.  I cannot say what I feel; for she has always
been very dear to me!'  In the pause before she spoke again the
beating of his own heart seemed to re-echo the quick sounds of
Stephen's galloping horse.  He was surprised at the method of her
speech when it did come; for she forgot her Quaker idiom, and spoke
in the phrasing of her youth:

'Do you love her still?'

'With all my soul!  More than ever!'

'Then, God be thanked; for it is in your power to do much good.  To
rescue a poor, human, grieving soul from despair!'  Her words
conveyed joy greater than she knew.  Harold did not himself know why
the air seemed filled with sounds that seemed to answer every doubt
of his life.  He felt, understood, with that understanding which is
quicker than thought.  The Silver Lady went on now with a rush:

'See, I have trusted you indeed!  I have given away another woman's
secret; but I do it without fear.  I can see that you also are
troubled; and when I look back on my own life and remember the
trouble that sent me out of the world; a lonely recluse here in this
spot far from the stress of life, I rejoice that any act of mine can
save such another tragedy as my own.  I see that I need not go into
detail.  You know that I am speaking truth.  It was before you came
so heroically on this new scene that she told me her secret.  At a
time when nothing was known of you except that you had disappeared.
When she laid bare her poor bleeding heart to me, she did it in such
wise that for an instant I feared that it was a murder which she had
committed.  Indeed, she called it so!  You understand that I know all
your secret; all her part in it at least.  And I know that you
understand what loving duty lies before you.  I see it in your eyes;
your brave, true eyes!  Go! and the Lord be with thee!'  Her
accustomed idiom had returned with prayer.  She turned her head away,
and, standing up, leaned against the window.  Bending over, he took
her hand and said simply:

'God bless you!  I shall come back to thank you either to-night or
to-morrow; and I hope that she will be with me.'

He went quickly out of the room.  The woman stood for long looking
out of the window, and following with tear-dimmed eyes the movement
of his great black horse as he swept across country straight as the
crow flies, towards the headland whither Stephen had gone.


Stephen passed over the wide expanse without thought; certainly
without memory of it.  Never in her after-life could she recall any
thought that had passed through her mind from the time she left the
open gate of the windmill yard till she pulled up her smoking,
panting horse beside the ruin of the fisher's house.

Stephen was not unhappy!  She was not happy in any conscious form.
She was satisfied rather than dissatisfied.  She was a woman!  A
woman who waited the coming of a man!

For a while she stood at the edge of the cliff, and looked at the
turmoil of the tide churning on the rocks below.  Her heart went out
in a great burst of thankfulness that it was her hand which had been
privileged to aid in rescuing so dear a life.  Then she looked around
her.  Ostensibly it was to survey the ruined house; but in reality to
search, even then under her lashes, the whole green expanse sloping
up to the windmill for some moving figure.  She saw that which made
her throat swell and her ears to hear celestial music.  But she would
not allow herself to think, of that at all events.  She was all woman
now; all-patient, and all-submissive.  She waited the man; and the
man was coming!

For a few minutes she walked round the house as though looking at it
critically for some after-purpose.  After the wreck Stephen had
suggested to Trinity House that there should be a lighthouse on the
point; and offered to bear the expense of building it.  She was
awaiting the answer of the Brethren; and of course nothing would be
done in clearing the ground for any purpose till the answer had come.
She felt now that if that reply was negative, she would herself build
there a pleasure-house of her own.

Then she went to the edge of the cliff, and went down the zigzag by
which the man and horse had gone to their gallant task.  At the edge
of the flat rock she sat and thought.

And through all her thoughts passed the rider who even now was
thundering over the green sward on his way to her.  In her fancy at
first, and later in her ears, she could hear the sound of his
sweeping gallop.

 It was thus that a man should come to a woman!

She had no doubts now.  Her quietude was a hymn of grateful praise!

The sound stopped.  With all her ears she listened, her heart now
beginning to beat furiously.  The sea before her, all lines and
furrows with the passing tide, was dark under the shadow of the
cliff; and the edge of the shadow was marked with the golden hue of
sunset.

And then she saw suddenly a pillar of shadow beyond the line of the
cliff.  It rested but a moment, moved swiftly along the edge, and
then was lost to her eyes.

But to another sense there was greater comfort:  she heard the
clatter of rolling pebbles and the scramble of eager feet.  Harold
was hastening down the zigzag.

Oh! the music of that sound!  It woke all the finer instincts of the
woman.  All the dross and thought of self passed away.  Nature, sweet
and simple and true, reigned alone.  Instinctively she rose and came
towards him.  In the simple nobility of her self-surrender and her
purpose, which were at one with the grandeur of nature around her, to
be negative was to be false.

Since he had spoken with the Silver Lady Harold had swept through the
air; the rush of his foaming horse over the sward had been but a slow
physical progress, which mocked the on-sweep of his mind.  In is
rapid ride he too had been finding himself.  By the reading of his
own soul he knew now that love needs a voice; that a man's love, to
be welcomed to the full, should be dominant and self-believing.

When the two saw each other's eyes there was no need for words.
Harold came close, opening wide his arms, Stephen flew to them.

In that divine moment, when their mouths met, both knew that their
souls were one.

"Chapter I
A Summons in the Night

It all seemed so real that I could hardly imagine that it had ever
occurred before; and yet each episode came, not as a fresh step in the
logic of things, but as something expected.  It is in such a wise that
memory plays its pranks for good or ill; for pleasure or pain; for weal
or woe.  It is thus that life is bittersweet, and that which has been
done becomes eternal.

Again, the light skiff, ceasing to shoot through the lazy water as when
the oars flashed and dripped, glided out of the fierce July sunlight
into the cool shade of the great drooping willow branches--I standing up
in the swaying boat, she sitting still and with deft fingers guarding
herself from stray twigs or the freedom of the resilience of moving
boughs.  Again, the water looked golden-brown under the canopy of
translucent green; and the grassy bank was of emerald hue.  Again, we
sat in the cool shade, with the myriad noises of nature both without and
within our bower merging into that drowsy hum in whose sufficing
environment the great world with its disturbing trouble, and its more
disturbing joys, can be effectually forgotten.  Again, in that blissful
solitude the young girl lost the convention of her prim, narrow
upbringing, and told me in a natural, dreamy way of the loneliness of
her new life. With an undertone of sadness she made m e feel how in that
spacious home each one of the household was isolated by the personal
magnificence of her father and herself; that there confidence had no
altar, and sympathy no shrine; and that there even her father's face was
as distant as the old country life seemed now.  Once more, the wisdom of
my manhood and the experience of my years laid themselves at the girl's
feet.  It was seemingly their own doing; for the individual ""I"" had no
say in the matter, but only just obeyed imperative orders.  And once
again the flying seconds multiplied themselves endlessly.  For it is in
the arcana of dreams that existences merge and renew themselves, change
and yet keep the same--like the soul of a musician in a fugue.  And so
memory swooned, again and again, in sleep.

It seems that there is never to be any perfect rest.  Even in Eden the
snake rears its head among the laden boughs of the Tree of Knowledge.
The silence of the dreamless night is broken by the roar of the
avalanche; the hissing of sudden floods; the clanging of the engine bell
marking its sweep through a sleeping American town; the clanking of
distant paddles over the sea....  Whatever it is, it is breaking the
charm of my Eden.  The canopy of greenery above us, starred with
diamond-points of light, seems to quiver in the ceaseless beat of
paddles; and the restless bell seems as though it would never cease....

All at once the gates of Sleep were thrown wide open, and my waking ears
took in the cause of the disturbing sounds.  Waking existence is prosaic
enough--there was somebody knocking and ringing at someone's street door.

I was pretty well accustomed in my Jermyn Street chambers to passing
sounds; usually I did not concern myself, sleeping or waking, with the
doings, however noisy, of my neighbours.  But this noise was too
continuous, too insistent, too imperative to be ignored.  There was some
active intelligence behind that ceaseless sound; and some stress or need
behind the intelligence.  I was not altogether selfish, and at the
thought of someone's need I was, without premeditation, out of bed.
Instinctively I looked at my watch.  It was just three o'clock; there
was a faint edging of grey round the green blind which darkened my room.
It was evident that the knocking and ringing were at the door of our own
house; and it was evident, too, that there was no one awake to answer
the call.  I slipped on my dressing-gown and slippers, and went down to
the hall door. When I opened it there stood a dapper groom, with one
hand pressed unflinchingly on the electric bell whilst with the other he
raised a ceaseless clangour with the knocker.  The instant he saw me the
noise ceased; one hand went up instinctively to the brim of his hat, and
the other produced a letter from his pocket.  A neat brougham was
opposite the door, the horses were breathing heavily as though they had
come fast.  A policeman, with his night lantern still alight at his
belt, stood by, attracted to the spot by the noise.

""Beg pardon, sir, I'm sorry for disturbing you, but my orders was
imperative; I was not to lose a moment, but to knock and ring till
someone came.  May I ask you, sir, if Mr. Malcolm Ross lives here?""

""I am Mr. Malcolm Ross.""

""Then this letter is for you, sir, and the bro'am is for you too, sir!""

I took, with a strange curiosity, the letter which he handed to me.  As
a barrister I had had, of course, odd experiences now and then,
including sudden demands upon my time; but never anything like this.  I
stepped back into the hall, closing the door to, but leaving it ajar;
then I switched on the electric light.  The letter was directed in a
strange hand, a woman's.  It began at once without ""dear sir"" or any
such address:

""You said you would like to help me if I needed it; and I believe you
meant what you said.  The time has come sooner than I expected.  I am in
dreadful trouble, and do not know where to turn, or to whom to apply. An
attempt has, I fear, been made to murder my Father; though, thank God,
he still lives.  But he is quite unconscious. The doctors and police
have been sent for; but there is no one here whom I can depend on.  Come
at once if you are able to; and forgive me if you can.  I suppose I
shall realise later what I have done in asking such a favour; but at
present I cannot think.  Come!  Come at once! MARGARET TRELAWNY.""

Pain and exultation struggled in my mind as I read; but the mastering
thought was that she was in trouble and had called on me--me!  My
dreaming of her, then, was not altogether without a cause.  I called out
to the groom:

""Wait!  I shall be with you in a minute!""  Then I flew upstairs.

A very few minutes sufficed to wash and dress; and we were soon driving
through the streets as fast as the horses could go.  It was market
morning, and when we got out on Picadilly there was an endless stream of
carts coming from the west; but for the rest the roadway was clear, and
we went quickly.  I had told the groom to come into the brougham with me
so that he could tell me what had happened as we went along.  He sat
awkwardly, with his hat on his knees as he spoke.

""Miss Trelawny, sir, sent a man to tell us to get out a carriage at
once; and when we was ready she come herself and gave me the letter and
told Morgan--the coachman, sir--to fly.  She said as I was to lose not a
second, but to keep knocking till someone come.""

""Yes, I know, I know--you told me!  What I want to know is, why she sent
for me. What happened in the house?""

""I don't quite know myself, sir; except that master was found in his
room senseless, with the sheets all bloody, and a wound on his head.  He
couldn't be waked nohow. ""Twas Miss Trelawny herself as found him.""

""How did she come to find him at such an hour?  It was late in the
night, I suppose?""

""I don't know, sir; I didn't hear nothing at all of the details.""

As he could tell me no more, I stopped the carriage for a moment to let
him get out on the box; then I turned the matter over in my mind as I
sat alone.  There were many things which I could have asked the servant;
and for a few moments after he had gone I was angry with myself for not
having used my opportunity.  On second thought, however, I was glad the
temptation was gone.  I felt that it would be more delicate to learn
what I wanted to know of Miss Trelawny's surroundings from herself,
rather than from her servants.

We bowled swiftly along Knightsbridge, the small noise of our well-
appointed vehicle sounding hollowly in the morning air.  We turned up
the Kensington Palace Road and presently stopped opposite a great house
on the left-hand side, nearer, so far as I could judge, the Notting Hill
than the Kensington end of the avenue.  It was a truly fine house, not
only with regard to size but to architecture.  Even in the dim grey
light of the morning, which tends to diminish the size of things, it
looked big.

Miss Trelawny met me in the hall.  She was not in any way shy.  She
seemed to rule all around her with a sort of high-bred dominance, all
the more remarkable as she was greatly agitated and as pale as snow.  In
the great hall were several servants, the men standing together near the
hall door, and the women clinging together in the further corners and
doorways.  A police superintendent had been talking to Miss Trelawny;
two  men in uniform and one plain-clothes man stood near him.  As she
took my hand impulsively there was a look of relief in her eyes, and she
gave a gentle sigh of relief.  Her salutation was simple.

""I knew you would come!""

The clasp of the hand can mean a great deal, even when it is not
intended to mean anything especially.  Miss Trelawny's hand somehow
became lost in my own.  It was not that it was a small hand; it was fine
and flexible, with long delicate fingers--a rare and beautiful hand; it
was the unconscious self-surrender.  And though at the moment I could
not dwell on the cause of the thrill which swept me, it came back to me
later.

She turned and said to the police superintendent:

""This is Mr. Malcolm Ross.""  The police officer saluted as he answered:

""I know Mr. Malcolm Ross, miss.  Perhaps he will rem ember I had the
honour of working with him in the Brixton Coining case.""  I had not at
first glance noticed who it was, my whole attention having been taken
with Miss Trelawny.

""Of course, Superintendent Dolan, I remember very well!"" I said as we
shook hands. I could not but note that the acquaintanceship seemed a
relief to Miss Trelawny. There was a certain vague uneasiness in her
manner which took my attention; instinctively I felt that it would be
less embarrassing for her to speak with me alone. So I said to the
Superintendent:

""Perhaps it will be better if Miss Trelawny will see me alone for a few
minutes.  You, of course, have already heard all she knows; and I shall
understand better how things are if I may ask some questions.  I will
then talk the matter over with you if I may.""

""I shall be glad to be of what service I can, sir,"" he answered
heartily.

Following Miss Trelawny, I moved over to a dainty room which opened from
the hall and looked out on the garden at the back of the house.  When we
had entered and I had closed the door she said:

""I will thank you later for your goodness in coming to me in my trouble;
but at present you can best help me when you know the facts.""

""Go on,"" I said.  ""Tell me all you know and spare no detail, however
trivial it may at the present time seem to be.""  She went on at once:

""I was awakened by some sound; I do not know what.  I only know that it
came through my sleep; for all at once I found myself awake, with my
heart beating wildly, listening anxiously for some sound from my
Father's room.  My room is next Father's, and I can often hear him
moving about before I fall asleep.  He works late at night, sometimes
very late indeed; so that when I wake early, as I do occasionally, or in
the grey of the dawn, I hear him still moving.  I tried once to
remonstrate with him about staying up so late, as it cannot be good for
him; but I never ventured to repeat the experiment.  You know how stern
and cold he can be--at least you may remember what I told you about him;
and when he is polite in this mood he is dreadful.  When he is angry I
can bear it much better; but when he is slow and deliberate, and the
side of his mouth lifts up to show the sharp teeth, I think I feel--well,
I don't know how!  Last night I got up softly and stole to the door, for
I really feared to disturb him.  There was not any noise of moving, and
no kind of cry at all; but there was a queer kind of dragging sound, and
a slow, heavy breathing. Oh! it was dreadful, waiting there in the dark
and the silence, and fearing--fearing I did not know what!

""At last I took my courage a deux mains, and turning the handle as
softly as I could, I opened the door a tiny bit.  It was quite dark
within; I could just see the outline of the windows.  But in the
darkness the sound of breathing, becoming more distinct, was appalling.
As I listened, this continued; but there was no other sound.  I pushed
the door open all at once.  I was afraid to open it slowly; I felt as if
there might be some dreadful thing behind it ready to pounce out on me!
Then I switched on the electric light, and stepped into the room.  I
looked first at the bed.  The sheets were all crumpled up, so that I
knew Father had been in bed; but there was a great dark red patch in the
centre of the bed, and spreading to the edge of it, that made my heart
stand still.  As I was gazing at it the sound of the breathing came
across the room, and my eyes followed to it.  There was Father on his
right side with the other arm under him, just as if his dead body had
been thrown there all in a heap.  The track of blood went across the
room up to the bed, and there was a pool all around him which looked
terribly red and glittering as I bent over to examine him.  The place
where he lay was right in front of the big safe.  He was in his pyjamas.
The left sleeve was torn, showing his bare arm, and stretched out toward
the safe.  It looked--oh! so terrible, patched all with blood, and with
the flesh torn or cut all around a gold chain bangle on his wrist.  I
did not know he wore such a thing, and it seemed to give me a new shock
of surprise.""

She paused a moment; and as I wished to relieve her by a moment's
divergence of thought, I said:

""Oh, that need not surprise you.  You will see the most unlikely men
wearing bangles.  I have seen a judge condemn a man to death, and the
wrist of the hand he held up had a gold bangle.""  She did not seem to
heed much the words or the idea; the pause, however, relieved her
somewhat, and she went on in a steadier voice:

""I did not lose a moment in summoning aid, for I feared he might bleed
to death.  I rang the bell, and then went out and called for help as
loudly as I could.  In what must have been a very short time--though it
seemed an incredibly long one to me--some of the servants came running
up; and then others, till the room seemed full of staring eyes, and
dishevelled hair, and night clothes of all sorts.

""We lifted Father on a sofa; and the housekeeper, Mrs. Grant, who seemed
to have her wits about her more than any of us, began to look where the
flow of blood came from.  In a few seconds it became apparent that it
came from the arm which was bare.  There was a deep wound--not clean-cut
as with a knife, but like a jagged rent or tear--close to the wrist,
which seemed to have cut into the vein.  Mrs. Grant tied a handkerchief
round the cut, and screwed it up tight with a silver paper-cutter; and
the flow of blood seemed to be checked at once.  By this time I had come
to my senses--or such of them as remained; and I sent off one man for the
doctor and another for the police.  When they had gone, I felt that,
except for the servants, I was all alone in the house, and that I knew
nothing--of my Father or anything else; and a great longing came to me to
have someone with me who could help me. Then I thought of you and your
kind offer in the boat under the willow-tree; and, without waiting to
think, I told the men to get a carriage ready at once, and I scribbled a
note and sent it on to you.""

She paused.  I did not like to say just then anything of how I felt.  I
looked at her; I think she understood, for her eyes were raised to mine
for a moment and then fell, leaving her cheeks as red as peony roses.
With a manifest effort she went on with her story:

""The Doctor was with us in an incredibly short time.  The groom had met
him letting himself into his house with his latchkey, and he came here
running.  He made a proper tourniquet for poor Father's arm, and then
went home to get some appliances.  I dare say he will be back almost
immediately.  Then a policeman came, and sent a message to the station;
and very soon the Superintendent was here.  Then you came.""

There was a long pause, and I ventured to take her hand for an instant.
Without a word more we opened the door, and joined the Superintendent in
the hall.  He hurried up to us, saying as he came:

""I have been examining everything myself, and have sent off a message to
Scotland Yard.  You see, Mr. Ross, there seemed so much that was odd
about the case that I thought we had better have the best man of the
Criminal Investigation Department that we could get.  So I sent a note
asking to have Sergeant Daw sent at once.  You remember him, sir, in
that American poisoning case at Hoxton.""

""Oh yes,"" I said, ""I remember him well; in that and other cases, for I
have benefited several times by his skill and acumen.  He has a mind
that works as truly as any that I know.  When I have been for the
defence, and believed my man was innocent, I was glad to have him
against us!""

""That is high praise, sir!"" said the Superintendent gratified:  ""I am
glad you approve of my choice; that I did well in sending for him.""

I answered heartily:

""Could not be better.  I do not doubt that between you we shall get at
the facts--and what lies behind them!""

We ascended to Mr. Trelawny's room, where we found everything exactly as
his daughter had described.

There came a ring at the house bell, and a minute later a man was shown
into the room.  A young man with aquiline features, keen grey eyes, and
a forehead that stood out square and broad as that of a thinker.  In his
hand he had a black bag which he at once opened.  Miss Trelawny
introduced us:  ""Doctor Winchester, Mr. Ross, Superintendent Dolan.""  We
bowed mutually, and he, without a moment's delay, began his work.  We
all waited, and eagerly watched him as he proceeded to dress the wound.
As he went on he turned now and again to call the Superintendent's
attention to some point about the wound, the latter proceeding to enter
the fact at once in his notebook.

""See! several parallel cuts or scratches beginning on the left side of
the wrist and in some places endangering the radial artery.

""These small wounds here, deep and jagged, seem as if made with a blunt
instrument.  This in particular would seem as if made with some kind of
sharp wedge; the flesh round it seems torn as if with lateral pressure.""

Turning to Miss Trelawny he said presently:

""Do you think we might remove this bangle?  It is not absolutely
necessary, as it will fall lower on the wrist where it can hang loosely;
but it might add to the patient's comfort later on.""  The poor girl
flushed deeply as she answered in a low voice:

""I do not know.  I--I have only recently come to live with my Father; and
I know so little of his life or his ideas that I fear i can hardly judge
in such a matter.  The Doctor, after a keen glance at her, said in a
very kindly way:

""Forgive me!  I did not know.  But in any case you need not be
distressed.  It is not required at present to move it.  Were it so I
should do so at once on my own responsibility.  If it be necessary later
on, we can easily remove it with a file.  Your Father doubtless has some
object in keeping it as it is.  See! there is a tiny key attached to it.
. . .""  As he was speaking he stopped and bent lower, taking from my
hand the candle which I held and lowering it till its light fell on the
bangle.  Then motioning me to hold the candle in the same position, he
took from his pocket a magnifying-glass which he adjusted.  When he had
made a careful examination he stood up and handed the magnifying-glass
to Dolan, saying as he did so:

""You had better examine it yourself.  That is no ordinary bangle.  The
gold is wrought over triple steel links; see where it is worn away.  It
is manifestly not meant to be removed lightly; and it would need more
than an ordinary file to do it.""

The Superintendent bent his great body; but not getting close enough
that way knelt down by the sofa as the Doctor had done.  He examined the
bangle minutely, turning it slowly round so that no particle of it
escaped observation. Then he stood up and handed the magnifying-glass to
me.  ""When you have examined it yourself,"" he said, ""let the lady look
at it if she will,"" and she commenced to write at length in his
notebook.

I made a simple alteration in his suggestion.  I held out the glass
toward Miss Trelawny, saying:

""Had you not better examine it first?""  She drew back, slightly raising
her hand in disclaimer, as she said impulsively:

""Oh no!  Father would doubtless have shown it to me had he wished me to
see it. I would not like to without his consent.""  Then she added,
doubtless fearing lest her delicacy of view should give offence to the
rest of us:

""Of course it is right that you should see it.  You have to examine and
consider everything; and indeed--indeed I am grateful to you. . .""

She turned away; I could see that she was crying quietly.  It was
evident to me that even in the midst of her trouble and anxiety there
was a chagrin that she knew so little of her father; and that her
ignorance had to be shown at such a time and amongst so many strangers.
That they were all men did not make the shame more easy to bear, though
there was a certain relief in it.  Trying to interpret her feelings I
could not but think that she must have been glad that no woman's eyes--of
understanding greater than man's--were upon her in that hour.

When I stood up from my examination, which verified to me that of the
Doctor, the latter resumed his place beside the couch and went on with
his ministrations. Superintendent Dolan said to me in a whisper:

""I think we are fortunate in our doctor!"" I nodded, and was about to add
something in praise of his acumen, when there came a low tapping at the
door.





Chapter II 
Strange Instructions

Superintendent Dolan went quietly to the door; by a sort of natural
understanding he had taken possession of affairs in the room.  The rest
of us waited.  He opened the door a little way; and then with a gesture
of manifest relief threw it wide, and a young man stepped in.  A young
man clean-shaven, tall and slight; with an eagle face and bright, quick
eyes that seemed to take in everything around him at a glance.  As he
came in, the Superintendent held out his hand; the two men shook hands
warmly.

""I came at once, sir, the moment I got your message.  I am glad I still
have your confidence.""

""That you'll always have,"" said the Superintendent heartily.  ""I have
not forgotten our old Bow Street days, and I never shall!""  Then,
without a word of preliminary, he began to tell everything he knew up to
the moment of the newcomer's entry. Sergeant Daw asked a few questions--a
very few--when it was necessary for his understanding of circumstances or
the relative positions of persons; but as a rule Dolan, who knew his
work thoroughly, forestalled every query, and explained all necessary
matters as he went on.  Sergeant Daw threw occasionally swift glances
round him; now at one of us; now at the room or some part of it; now at
the wounded man lying senseless on the sofa.

When the Superintendent had finished, the Sergeant turned to me and
said:

""Perhaps you remember me, sir.  I was with you in that Hoxton case.""

""I remember you very well,"" I said as I held out my hand.  The
Superintendent spoke again:

""You understand, Sergeant Daw, that you are put in full charge of this
case.""

""Under you I hope, sir,"" he interrupted.  The other shook his head and
smiled as he said:

""It seems to me that this is a case that will take all a man's time and
his brains.  I have other work to do; but I shall be more than
interested, and if I can help in any possible way I shall be glad to do
so!""

""All right, sir,"" said the other, accepting his responsibility with a
sort of modified salute; straightway he began his investigation.

First he came over to the Doctor and, having learned his name and
address, asked him to write a full report which he could use, and which
he could refer to headquarters if necessary.  Doctor Winchester bowed
gravely as he promised.  Then the Sergeant approached me and said sotto
voce:

""I like the look of your doctor.  I think we can work together!""
Turning to Miss Trelawny he asked:

""Please let me know what you can of your Father; his ways of life, his
history--in fact of anything of whatsoever kind which interests him, or
in which he may be concerned.""  I was about to interrupt to tell him
what she had already said of her ignorance in all matters of her father
and his ways, but her warning hand was raised to me pointedly and she
spoke herself.

""Alas!  I know little or nothing.  Superintendent Dolan and Mr. Ross
know already all I can say.""

""Well, ma'am, we must be content to do what we can,"" said the officer
genially. ""I'll begin by making a minute examination.  You say that you
were outside the door when you heard the noise?""

""I was in my room when I heard the queer sound--indeed it must have been
the early part of whatever it was which woke me.  I came out of my room
at once. Father's door was shut, and I could see the whole landing and
the upper slopes of the staircase.  No one could have left by the door
unknown to me, if that is what you mean!""

""That is just what I do mean, miss.  If every one who knows anything
will tell me as well as that, we shall soon get to the bottom of this.""

He then went over to the bed, looked at it carefully, and asked:

""Has the bed been touched?""

""Not to my knowledge,"" said Miss Trelawny, ""but I shall ask Mrs. Grant--
the housekeeper,"" she added as she rang the bell.  Mrs. Grant answered
it in person. ""Come in,"" said Miss Trelawny.  ""These gentlemen want to
know, Mrs. Grant, if the bed has been touched.""

""Not by me, ma'am.""

""Then,"" said Miss Trelawny, turning to Sergeant Daw, ""it cannot have
been touched by any one.  Either Mrs. Grant or I myself was here all the
time, and I do not think any of the servants who came when I gave the
alarm were near the bed at all.  You see, Father lay here just under the
great safe, and every one crowded round him.  We sent them all away in a
very short time.""  Daw, with a motion of his hand, asked us all to stay
at the other side of the room whilst with a magnifying-glass he examined
the bed, taking care as he moved each fold of the bed-clothes to replace
it in exact position.  Then he examined with his magnifying-glass the
floor beside it, taking especial pains where the blood had trickled over
the side of the bed, which was of heavy red wood handsomely carved.
Inch by inch, down on his knees, carefully avoiding any touch with the
stains on the floor, he followed the blood-marks over to the spot, close
under the great safe, where the body had lain.  All around and about
this spot he went for a radius of some yards; but seemingly did not meet
with anything to arrest special attention.  Then he examined the front
of the safe; round the lock, and along the bottom and top of the double
doors, more especially at the places of their touching in front.

Next he went to the windows, which were fastened down with the hasps.

""Were the shutters closed?"" he asked Miss Trelawny in a casual way as
though he expected the negative answer, which came.

All this time Doctor Winchester was attending to his patient; now
dressing the wounds in the wrist or making minute examination all over
the head and throat, and over the heart.  More than once he put his nose
to the mouth of the senseless man and sniffed.  Each time he did so he
finished up by unconsciously looking round the room, as though in search
of something.

Then we heard the deep strong voice of the Detective:

""So far as I can see, the object was to bring that key to the lock of
the safe.  There seems to be some secret in the mechanism that I am
unable to guess at, though I served a year in Chubb's before I joined
the police.  It is a combination lock of seven letters; but there seems
to be a way of locking even the combination.  It is one of Chatwood's; I
shall call at their place and find out something about it.""  Then
turning to the Doctor, as though his own work were for the present done,
he said:

""Have you anything you can tell me at once, Doctor, which will not
interfere with your full report?  If there is any doubt I can wait, but
the sooner I know something definite the better.""  Doctor Winchester
answered at once:

""For my own part I see no reason in waiting.  I shall make a full report
of course.  But in the meantime I shall tell you all I know--which is
after all not very much, and all I think--which is less definite.  There
is no wound on the head which could account for the state of stupor in
which the patient continues.  I must, therefore, take it that either he
has been drugged or is under some hypnotic influence.  So far as I can
judge, he has not been drugged--at least by means of any drug of whose
qualities I am aware.  Of course, there is ordinarily in this room so
much of a mummy smell that it is difficult to be certain about anything
having a delicate aroma.  I dare say that you have noticed the peculiar
Egyptians scents, bitumen, nard, aromatic gums and spices, and so forth.
It is quite possible that somewhere in this room, amongst the curios and
hidden by stronger scents, is some substance or liquid which may have
the effect we see.  It is possible that the patient has taken some drug,
and that he may in some sleeping phase have injured himself.  I do not
think this is likely; and circumstances, other than those which I have
myself been investigating, may prove that this surmise is not correct.
But in the meantime it is possible; and must, till it be disproved, be
kept within our purview.""  Here Sergeant Daw interrupted:

""That may be, but if so, we should be able to find the instrument with
which the wrist was injured.  There would be marks of blood somewhere.""

""Exactly so!"" said the Doctor, fixing his glasses as though preparing
for an argument. ""But if it be that the patient has used some strange
drug, it may be one that does not take effect at once.  As we are as yet
ignorant of its potentialities--if, indeed, the whole surmise is correct
at all--we must be prepared at all points.""

Here Miss Trelawny joined in the conversation:

""That would be quite right, so far as the action of the drug was
concerned; but according to the second part of your surmise the wound
may have been self-inflicted, and this after the drug had taken
effect.""

""True!"" said the Detective and the Doctor simultaneously.  She went on:

""As however, Doctor, your guess does not exhaust the possibilities, we
must bear in mind that some other variant of the same root-idea may be
correct.  I take it, therefore, that our first search, to be made on
this assumption, must be for the weapon with which the injury was done
to my Father's wrist.""

""Perhaps he put the weapon in the safe before he became quite
unconscious,"" said I, giving voice foolishly to a half-formed thought.

""That could not be,"" said the Doctor quickly.  ""At least I think it
could hardly be,"" he added cautiously, with a brief bow to me.  ""You
see, the left hand is covered with blood; but there is no blood mark
whatever on the safe.""

""Quite right!"" I said, and there was a long pause.

The first to break the silence was the Doctor.

""We shall want a nurse here as soon as possible; and I know the very one
to suit.  I shall go at once to get her if I can.  I must ask that till
I return some of you will remain constantly with the patient.  It may be
necessary to remove him to another room later on; but in the meantime he
is best left here.  Miss Trelawny, may I take it that either you or Mrs.
Grant will remain her--not merely in the room, but close to the patient
and watchful of him--till I return?""

She bowed in reply, and took a seat beside the sofa.  The Doctor gave
her some directions as to what she should do in case her father should
become conscious before his return.

The next to move was Superintendent Dolan, who came close to Sergeant
Daw as he said:

""I had better return now to the station--unless, of course, you should
wish me to remain for a while.""

He answered, ""Is Johnny Wright still in your division?""

""Yes!  Would you like him to be with you?""  The other nodded reply.
""Then I will send him on to you as soon as can be arranged.  He shall
then stay with you as long as you wish.  I will tell him that he is to
take his instructions entirely from you.""

The Sergeant accompanied him to the door, saying as he went:

""Thank you, sir; you are always thoughtful for men who are working with
you.  It is a pleasure to me to be with you again.  I shall go back to
Scotland Yard and report to my chief.  Then I shall call at Chatwood's;
and I shall return here as soon as possible. I suppose I may take it,
miss, that I may put up here for a day or two, if required.  It may be
some help, or possibly some comfort to you, if I am about, until we
unravel this mystery.""

""I shall be very grateful to you.""  He looked keenly at her for a few
seconds before he spoke again.

""Before I go have I permission to look about your Father's table and
desk?  There might be something which would give us a clue--or a lead at
all events.""  Her answer was so unequivocal as almost to surprise him.

""You have the fullest possible permission to do anything which may help
us in this dreadful trouble--to discover what it is that is wrong with my
Father, or which may shield him in the future!""

He began at once a systematic search of the dressing-table, and after
that of the writing-table in the room.  In one of the drawers he found a
letter sealed; this he brought at once across the room and handed to
Miss Trelawny.

""A letter--directed to me--and in my Father's hand!"" she said as she
eagerly opened it.  I watched her face as she began to read; but seeing
at once that Sergeant Daw kept his keen eyes on her face, unflinchingly
watching every flitting expression, I kept my eyes henceforth fixed on
his.  When Miss Trelawny had read her letter through, I had in my mind a
conviction, which, however, I kept locked in my own heart.  Amongst the
suspicions in the mind of the Detective was one, rather perhaps
potential than definite, of Miss Trelawny herself.

For several minutes Miss Trelawny held the letter in her hand with her
eyes downcast, thinking.  Then she read it carefully again; this time
the varying expressions were intensified, and I thought I could easily
follow them.  When she had finished the second reading, she paused
again.  Then, though with some reluctance, she handed the letter to the
Detective.  He read it eagerly but with unchanging face; read it a
second time, and then handed it back with a bow.  She paused a little
again, and then handed it to me.  As she did so she raised her eyes to
mine for a single moment appealingly; a swift blush spread over her pale
cheeks and forehead.

With mingled feelings I took it, but, all said, I was glad.  She did not
show any perturbation in giving the letter to the Detective--she might
not have shown any to anyone else.  But to me. . .I feared to follow the
thought further; but read on, conscious that the eyes of both Miss
Trelawny and the Detective were fixed on me.

""MY DEAR DAUGHTER,  I want you to take this letter as an instruction--
absolute and imperative, and admitting of no deviation whatever--in case
anything untoward or unexpected by you or by others should happen to me.
If I should be suddenly and mysteriously stricken down--either by
sickness, accident or attack--you must follow these directions
implicitly.  If I am not already in my bedroom when you are made
cognisant of my state, I am to be brought there as quickly as possible.
Even should I be dead, my body is to be brought there.  Thenceforth,
until I am either conscious and able to give instructions on my own
account, or buried, I am never to be left alone--not for a single
instant.  From nightfall to sunrise at least two persons must remain in
the room.  It will be well that a trained nurse be in the room from time
to time, and will note any symptoms, either permanent or changing, which
may strike her.  My solicitors, Marvin & Jewkes, of 27B Lincoln's Inn,
have full instructions in case of my death; and Mr. Marvin has himself
undertaken to see personally my wishes carried out.  I should advise
you, my dear Daughter, seeing that you have no relative to apply to, to
get some friend whom you can trust to either remain within the house
where instant communication can be made, or to come nightly to aid in
the watching, or to be within call.  Such friend may be either male or
female; but, whichever it may be, there should be added one other
watcher or attendant at hand of the opposite sex.  Understand, that it
is of the very essence of my wish that there should be, awake and
exercising themselves to my purposes, both masculine and feminine
intelligences.  Once more, my dear Margaret, let me impress on you the
need for observation and just reasoning to conclusions, howsoever
strange.  If I am taken ill or injured, this will be no ordinary
occasion; and I wish to warn you, so that your guarding may be complete.

""Nothing in my room--I speak of the curios--must be removed or displaced
in any way, or for any cause whatever.  I have a special reason and a
special purpose in the placing of each; so that any moving of them would
thwart my plans.

""Should you want money or counsel in anything, Mr. Marvin will carry out
your wishes; to the which he has my full instructions.""

          ""ABEL TRELAWNY.""

I read the letter a second time before speaking, for I feared to betray
myself.  The choice of a friend might be a momentous occasion for me.  I
had already ground for hope, that she had asked me to help her in the
first throe of her trouble; but love makes its own doubtings, and I
feared.  My thoughts seemed to whirl with lightning rapidity, and in a
few seconds a whole process of reasoning became formulated.  I must not
volunteer to be the friend that the father advised his daughter to have
to aid her in her vigil; and yet that one glance had a lesson which I
must not ignore.  Also, did not she, when she wanted help, send to me--to
me a stranger, except for one meeting at a dance and one brief afternoon
of companionship on the river?  Would it not humiliate her to make her
ask me twice?  Humiliate her!  No! that pain I could at all events save
her; it is not humiliation to refuse.  So, as I handed her back the
letter, I said:

""I know you will forgive me, Miss Trelawny, if I presume too much; but
if you will permit me to aid in the watching I shall be proud.  Though
the occasion is a sad one, I shall be so far happy to be allowed the
privilege.""

Despite her manifest and painful effort at self-control, the red tide
swept her face and neck.  Even her eyes seemed suffused, and in stern
contrast with her pale cheeks when the tide had rolled back.  She
answered in a low voice:

""I shall be very grateful for your help!""  Then in an afterthought she
added:

""But you must not let me be selfish in my need!  I know you have many
duties to engage you; and though I shall value your help highly--most
highly--it would not be fair to monopolise your time.""

""As to that,"" I answered at once, ""my time is yours.  I can for today
easily arrange my work so that I can come here in the afternoon and stay
till morning.  After that, if the occasion still demands it, I can so
arrange my work that I shall have more time still at my disposal.""

She was much moved.  I could see the tears gather in her eyes, and she
turned away her head.  The Detective spoke:

""I am glad you will be here, Mr. Ross.  I shall be in the house myself,
as Miss Trelawny will allow me, if my people in Scotland Yard will
permit.  That letter seems to put a different complexion on everything;
though the mystery remains greater than ever. If you can wait here an
hour or two I shall go to headquarters, and then to the safe-makers.
After that I shall return; and you can go away easier in your mind, for
I shall be here.""

When he had gone, we two, Miss Trelawny and I, remained in silence.  At
last she raised her eyes and looked at me for a moment; after that I
would not have exchanged places with a king.  For a while she busied
herself round the extemporised bedside of her father.  Then, asking me
to be sure not to take my eyes off him till she returned, she hurried
out.

In a few minutes she came back with Mrs. Grant and two maids and a
couple of men, who bore the entire frame and furniture of a light iron
bed.  This they proceeded to put together and to make.  When the work
was completed, and the servants had withdrawn, she said to me:

""It will be well to be all ready when the Doctor returns.  He will
surely want to have Father put to bed; and a proper bed will be better
for him than the sofa.""  She then got a chair close beside her father,
and sat down watching him.

I went about the room, taking accurate note of all i saw.  And truly
there were enough things in the room to evoke the curiosity of any man--
even though the attendant circumstances were less strange.  The whole
place, excepting those articles of furniture necessary to a
well-furnished bedroom, was filled with magnificent curios, chiefly
Egyptian. As the room was of immense size there was opportunity for the
placing of a large number of them, even if, as with these, they were of
huge proportions.

Whilst I was still investigating the room there came the sound of wheels
on the gravel outside the house.  There was a ring at the hall door, and
a few minutes later, after a preliminary tap at the door and an
answering ""Come in!"" Doctor Winchester entered, followed by a young
woman in the dark dress of a nurse.

""I have been fortunate!"" he said as he came in.  ""I found her at once
and free. Miss Trelawny, this is Nurse Kennedy!""





Chapter III
The Watchers

I was struck by the way the two young women looked at each other.  I
suppose I have been so much in the habit of weighing up in my own mind
the personality of witnesses and of forming judgment by their
unconscious action and mode of bearing themselves, that the habit
extends to my life outside as well as within the court-house.  At this
moment of my life anything that interested Miss Trelawny interested me;
and as she had been struck by the newcomer I instinctively weighed her
up also. By comparison of the two I seemed somehow to gain a new
knowledge of Miss Trelawny.  Certainly, the two women made a good
contrast.  Miss Trelawny was of fine figure; dark, straight-featured.
She had marvellous eyes; great, wide-open, and as black and soft as
velvet, with a mysterious depth.  To look in them was like gazing at a
black mirror such as Doctor Dee used in his wizard rites.  I heard an
old gentleman at the picnic, a great oriental traveller, describe the
effect of her eyes ""as looking at night at the great distant lamps of a
mosque through the open door.""  The eyebrows were typical.  Finely
arched and rich in long curling hair, they seemed like the proper
architectural environment of the deep, splendid eyes.  Her hair was
black also, but was as fine as silk.  Generally black hair is a type of
animal strength and seems as if some strong expression of the forces of
a strong nature; but in this case there could be no such thought.  There
were refinement and high breeding; and though there was no suggestion of
weakness, any sense of power there was, was rather spiritual than
animal.  The whole harmony of her being seemed complete. Carriage,
figure, hair, eyes; the mobile, full mouth, whose scarlet lips and white
teeth seemed to light up the lower part of the face--as the eyes did the
upper; the wide sweep of the jaw from chin to ear; the long, fine
fingers; the hand which seemed to move from the wrist as though it had a
sentience of its own.  All these perfections went to make up a
personality that dominated either by its grace, its sweetness, its
beauty, or its charm.

Nurse Kennedy, on the other hand, was rather under than over a woman's
average height.  She was firm and thickset, with full limbs and broad,
strong, capable hands. Her colour was in the general effect that of an
autumn leaf.  The yellow-brown hair was thick and long, and the
golden-brown eyes sparkled from the freckled, sunburnt skin.  Her rosy
cheeks gave a general idea of rich brown.  The red lips and white teeth
did not alter the colour scheme, but only emphasized it.  She had a snub
nose--there was no possible doubt about it; but like such noses in
general it showed a nature generous, untiring, and full of good-nature.
Her broad white forehead, which even the freckles had spared, was full
of forceful thought and reason.

Doctor Winchester had on their journey from the hospital, coached her in
the necessary particulars, and without a word she took charge of the
patient and set to work.  Having examined the new-made bed and shaken
the pillows, she spoke to the Doctor, who gave instructions; presently
we all four, stepping together, lifted the unconscious man from the
sofa.

Early in the afternoon, when Sergeant Daw had returned, I called at my
rooms in Jermyn Street, and sent out such clothes, books and papers as I
should be likely to want within a few days.  Then I went on to keep my
legal engagements.

The Court sat late that day as an important case was ending; it was
striking six as I drove in at the gate of the Kensington Palace Road.  I
found myself installed in a large room close to the sick chamber.

That night we were not yet regularly organised for watching, so that the
early part of the evening showed an unevenly balanced guard.  Nurse
Kennedy, who had been on duty all day, was lying down, as she had
arranged to come on again by twelve o'clock.  Doctor Winchester, who was
dining in the house, remained in the room until dinner was announced;
and went back at once when it was over.  During dinner Mrs. Grant
remained in the room, and with her Sergeant Daw, who wished to complete
a minute examination which he had undertaken of everything in the room
and near it.  At nine o'clock Miss Trelawny and I went in to relieve the
Doctor. She had lain down for a few hours in the afternoon so as to be
refreshed for her work at night.  She told me that she had determined
that for this night at least she would sit up and watch.  I did not try
to dissuade her, for I knew that her mind was made up.  Then and there I
made up my mind that I would watch with her--unless, of course, I should
see that she really did not wish it.  I said nothing of my intentions
for the present.  We came in on tiptoe, so silently that the Doctor, who
was bending over the bed, did not hear us, and seemed a little startled
when suddenly looking up he saw our eyes upon him.  I felt that the
mystery of the whole thing was getting on his nerves, as it had already
got on the nerves of some others of us.  He was, I fancied, a little
annoyed with himself for having been so startled, and at once began to
talk in a hurried manner as though to get over our idea of his
embarrassment:

""I am really and absolutely at my wits"" end to find any fit cause for
this stupor.  I have made again as accurate an examination as I know
how, and I am satisfied that there is no injury to the brain, that is,
no external injury.  Indeed, all his vital organs seem unimpaired.  I
have given him, as you know, food several times and it has manifestly
done him good.  His breathing is strong and regular, and his pulse is
slower and stronger than it was this morning.  I cannot find evidence of
any known drug, and his unconsciousness does not resemble any of the
many cases of hypnotic sleep which I saw in the Charcot Hospital in
Paris.  And as to these wounds""--he laid his finger gently on the
bandaged wrist which lay outside the coverlet as he spoke, ""I do not
know what to make of them.  They might have been made by a
carding-machine; but that supposition is untenable.  It is within the
bounds of possibility that they might have been made by a wild animal if
it had taken care to sharpen its claws.  That too is, I take it,
impossible. By the way, have you any strange pets here in the house;
anything of an exceptional kind, such as a tiger-cat or anything out of
the common?"" Miss Trelawny smiled a sad smile which made my heart ache,
as she made answer:

""Oh no!  Father does not like animals about the house, unless they are
dead and mummied.""  This was said with a touch of bitterness--or
jealousy, I could hardly tell which.  ""Even my poor kitten was only
allowed in the house on sufferance; and though he is the dearest and
best-conducted cat in the world, he is now on a sort of parole, and is
not allowed into this room.""

As she was speaking a faint rattling of the door handle was heard.
Instantly Miss Trelawny's face brightened.  She sprang up and went over
to the door, saying as she went:

""There he is!  That is my Silvio.  He stands on his hind legs and
rattles the door handle when he wants to come into a room.""  She opened
the door, speaking to the cat as though he were a baby:  ""Did him want
his movver?  Come then; but he must stay with her!""  She lifted the cat,
and came back with him in her arms.  He was certainly a magnificent
animal.  A chinchilla grey Persian with long silky hair; a really lordly
animal with a haughty bearing despite his gentleness; and with great
paws which spread out as he placed them on the ground.  Whilst she was
fondling him, he suddenly gave a wriggle like an eel and slipped out of
her arms.  He ran across the room and stood opposite a low table on
which stood the mummy of an animal, and began to mew and snarl.  Miss
Trelawny was after him in an instant and lifted him in her arms, kicking
and struggling and wriggling to get away; but not biting or scratching,
for evidently he loved his beautiful mistress.  He ceased to make a
noise the moment he was in her arms; in a whisper she admonished him:

""O you naughty Silvio!  You have broken your parole that mother gave for
you.  Now, say goodnight to the gentlemen, and come away to mother's
room!""  As she was speaking she held out the cat's paw to me to shake.
As I did so I could not but admire its size and beauty.  ""Why,"" said I,
""his paw seems like a little boxing-glove full of claws.""  She smiled:

""So it ought to.  Don't you notice that my Silvio has seven toes, see!""
she opened the paw; and surely enough there were seven separate claws,
each of them sheathed in a delicate, fine, shell-like case.  As I gently
stroked the foot the claws emerged and one of them accidentally--there
was no anger now and the cat was purring--stuck into my hand.
Instinctively I said as I drew back:

""Why, his claws are like razors!""

Doctor Winchester had come close to us and was bending over looking at
the cat's claws; as I spoke he said in a quick, sharp way:

""Eh!""  I could hear the quick intake of his breath.  Whilst I was
stroking the now quiescent cat, the Doctor went to the table and tore
off a piece of blotting-paper from the writing-pad and came back.  He
laid the paper on his palm and, with a simple ""pardon me!"" to Miss
Trelawny, placed the cat's paw on it and pressed it down with his other
hand.  The haughty cat seemed to resent somewhat the familiarity, and
tried to draw its foot away.  This was plainly what the Doctor wanted,
for in the act the cat opened the sheaths of its claws and and made
several reefs in the soft paper. Then Miss Trelawny took her pet away.
She returned in a couple of minutes; as she came in she said:

""It is most odd about that mummy!  When Silvio came into the room
first--indeed I took him in as a kitten to show to Father--he went on
just the same way.  He jumped up on the table, and tried to scratch and
bite the mummy.  That was what made Father so angry, and brought the
decree of banishment on poor Silvio.  Only his parole, given through me,
kept him in the house.""

Whilst she had been gone, Doctor Winchester had taken the bandage from
her father's wrist.  The wound was now quite clear, as the separate cuts
showed out in fierce red lines.  The Doctor folded the blotting-paper
across the line of punctures made by the cat's claws, and held it down
close to the wound.  As he did so, he looked up triumphantly and
beckoned us over to him.

The cuts in the paper corresponded with the wounds in the wrist!  No
explanation was needed, as he said;

""It would have been better if master Silvio had not broken his parole!""

We were all silent for a little while.  Suddenly Miss Trelawny said:

""But Silvio was not in here last night!""

""Are you sure?  Could you prove that is necessary?""  She hesitated
before replying:

""I am certain of it; but I fear it would be difficult to prove.  Silvio
sleeps in a basket in my room.  I certainly put him to bed last night; I
remember distinctly laying his little blanket over him, and tucking him
in.  This morning I took him out of the basket myself.  I certainly
never noticed him in here; though, of course, that would not mean much,
for I was too concerned about poor father, and too much occupied with
him, to notice even Silvio.""

The Doctor shook his head as he said with a certain sadness:

""Well, at any rate it is no use trying to prove anything now.  Any cat
in the world would have cleaned blood-marks--did any exist--from his paws
in a hundredth part of the time that has elapsed.""

Again we were all silent; and again the silence was broken by Miss
Trelawny:

""But now that I think of it, it could not have been poor Silvio that
injured Father. My door was shut when I first heard the sound; and
Father's was shut when I listened at it.  When I went in, the injury had
been done; so that it must have been before Silvio could possibly have
got in.""  This reasoning commended itself, especially to me as a
barrister, for it was proof to satisfy a jury.  It gave me a distinct
pleasure to have Silvio acquitted of the crime--possibly because he was
Miss Trelawny's cat and was loved by her.  Happy cat!  Silvio's mistress
was manifestly pleased as I said:

""Verdict, 'not guilty!'""  Doctor Winchester after a pause observed:

""My apologies to master Silvio on this occasion; but I am still puzzled
to know why he is so keen against that mummy.  Is he the same toward the
other mummies in the house?  There are, I suppose, a lot of them.  I saw
three in the hall as I came in.""

""There are lots of them,"" she answered.  ""I sometimes don't know whether
I am in a private house or the British Museum.  But Silvio never
concerns himself about any of them except that particular one.  I
suppose it must be because it is of an animal, not a man or a woman.""

""Perhaps it is of a cat!"" said the Doctor as he started up and went
across the room to look at the mummy more closely.  ""Yes,"" he went on,
""it is the mummy of a cat; and a very fine one, too.  If it hadn't been
a special favourite of some very special person it would never have
received so much honour.  See!  A painted case and obsidian eyes-just
like a human mummy.  It is an extraordinary thing, that knowledge of
kind to kind.  Here is a dead cat--that is all; it is perhaps four or
five thousand years old--and another cat of another breed, in what is
practically another world, is ready to fly at it, just as it would if it
were not dead.  I should like to experiment a bit about that cat if you
don't mind, Miss Trelawny.""  She hesitated before replying:

""Of course, do anything you may think necessary or wise; but I hope it
will not be anything to hurt or worry my poor Silvio.""  The Doctor
smiled as he answered:

""Oh, Silvio would be all right:  it is the other one that my sympathies
would be reserved for.""

""How do you mean?""

""Master Silvio will do the attacking; the other one will do the
suffering.""

""Suffering?""  There was a note of pain in her voice.  The Doctor smiled
more broadly:

""Oh, please make your mind easy as to that.  The other won't suffer as
we understand it; except perhaps in his structure and outfit.""

""What on earth do you mean?""

""Simply this, my dear young lady, that the antagonist will be a mummy
cat like this one.  There are, I take it, plenty of them to be had in
Museum Street.  I shall get one and place it here instead of that one--
you won't think that a temporary exchange will violate your Father's
instructions, I hope.  We shall then find out, to begin with, whether
Silvio objects to all mummy cats, or only to this one in particular.""

""I don't know,"" she said doubtfully.  ""Father's instructions seem very
uncompromising.""  Then after a pause she went on:  ""But of course under
the circumstances anything that is to be ultimately for his good must be
done.  I suppose there can't be anything very particular about the mummy
of a cat.""

Doctor Winchester said nothing.  He sat rigid, with so grave a look on
his face that his extra gravity passed on to me; and in its enlightening
perturbation I began to realise more than I had yet done the strangeness
of the case in which I was now so deeply concerned.  When once this
thought had begun there was no end to it.  Indeed it grew, and
blossomed, and reproduced itself in a thousand different ways.  The room
and all in it gave grounds for strange thoughts.  There were so many
ancient relics that unconsciously one was taken back to strange lands
and strange times.  There were so many mummies or mummy objects, round
which there seemed to cling for ever the penetrating odours of bitumen,
and spices and gums--""Nard and Circassia's balmy smells""--that one was
unable to forget the past.  Of course, there was but little light in the
room, and that carefully shaded; so that there was no glare anywhere.
None of that direct light which can manifest itself as a power or an
entity, and so make for companionship.  The room was a large one, and
lofty in proportion to its size.  In its vastness was place for a
multitude of things not often found in a bedchamber.  In far corners
of the room were shadows of uncanny shape.  More than once as I thought,
the multitudinous presence of the dead and the past took such hold on me
that I caught myself looking round fearfully as though some strange
personality or influence was present.  Even the manifest presence of
Doctor Winchester and Miss Trelawny could not altogether comfort or
satisfy me at such moments.  It was with a distinct sense of relief that
I saw a new personality in the room in the shape of Nurse Kennedy.
There was no doubt that that business-like, self-reliant, capable young
woman added an element of security to such wild imaginings as my own.
She had a quality of common sense that seemed to pervade everything
around her, as though it were some kind of emanation.  Up to that moment
I had been building fancies around the sick man; so that finally all
about him, including myself, had become involved in them, or enmeshed,
or saturated, or. . .But now that she had come, he relapsed into his
proper perspective as a patient; the room was a sick-room, and the
shadows lost their fearsome quality.  The only thing which it could not
altogether abrogate was the strange Egyptian smell. You may put a mummy
in a glass case and hermetically seal it so that no corroding air can
get within; but all the same it will exhale its odour.  One might think
that four or five thousand years would exhaust the olfactory qualities
of anything; but experience teaches us that these smells remain, and
that their secrets are unknown to us.  Today they are as much mysteries
as they were when the embalmers put the body in the bath of natron. . .

All at once I sat up.  I had become lost in an absorbing reverie.  The
Egyptian smell had seemed to get on my nerves--on my memory--on my very
will.

At that moment I had a thought which was like an inspiration.  If I was
influenced in such a manner by the smell, might it not be that the sick
man, who lived half his life or more in the atmosphere, had gradually
and by slow but sure process taken into his system something which had
permeated him to such degree that it had a new power derived from
quantity--or strength--or. . .

I was becoming lost again in a reverie.  This would not do.  I must take
such precaution that I could remain awake, or free from such entrancing
thought.  I had had but half a night's sleep last night; and this night
I must remain awake.  Without stating my intention, for I feared that I
might add to the trouble and uneasiness of Miss Trelawny, I went
downstairs and out of the house.  I soon found a chemist's shop, and
came away with a respirator.  When I got back, it was ten o'clock; the
Doctor was going for the night.  The Nurse came with him to the door of
the sick-room, taking her last instructions.  Miss Trelawny sat still
beside the bed.  Sergeant Daw, who had entered as the Doctor went out,
was some little distance off.

When Nurse Kennedy joined us, we arranged that she should sit up till
two o'clock, when Miss Trelawny would relieve her.  Thus, in accordance
with Mr. Trelawny's instructions, there would always be a man and a
woman in the room; and each one of us would overlap, so that at no time
would a new set of watchers come on duty without some one to tell of
what--if anything--had occurred.  I lay down on a sofa in my own room,
having arranged that one of the servants should call me a little before
twelve.  In a few moments I was asleep.

When I was waked, it took me several seconds to get back my thoughts so
as to recognise my own identity and surroundings.  The short sleep had,
however, done me good, and I could look on things around me in a more
practical light than I had been able to do earlier in the evening.  I
bathed my face, and thus refreshed went into the sick-room.  I moved
very softly.  The Nurse was sitting by the bed, quiet and alert; the
Detective sat in an arm-chair across the room in deep shadow.  He did
not move when I crossed, until I got close to him, when he said in a
dull whisper:

""It is all right; I have not been asleep!""  An unnecessary thing to say,
I thought--it always is, unless it be untrue in spirit.  When I told him
that his watch was over; that he might go to bed till I should call him
at six o'clock, he seemed relieved and went with alacrity.  At the door
he turned and, coming back to me, said in a whisper:

""I sleep lightly and I shall have my pistols with me.  I won't feel so
heavy-headed when I get out of this mummy smell.""

He too, then, had shared my experience of drowsiness!

I asked the Nurse if she wanted anything.  I noticed that she had a
vinaigrette in her lap.  Doubtless she, too, had felt some of the
influence which had so affected me. She said that she had all she
required, but that if she should want anything she would at once let me
know.  I wished to keep her from noticing my respirator, so I went to
the chair in the shadow where her back was toward me.  Here I quietly
put it on, and made myself comfortable.

For what seemed a long time, I sat and thought and though.  It was a
wild medley of thoughts, as might have been expected from the
experiences of the previous day and night.  Again I found myself
thinking of the Egyptian smell; and I remember that I felt a delicious
satisfaction that I did not experience it as I had done.  The respirator
was doing its work.

It must have been that the passing of this disturbing thought made for
repose of mind, which is the corollary of bodily rest, for, though I
really cannot remember being asleep or waking from it, I saw a vision--I
dreamed a dream, I scarcely know which.

I was still in the room, seated in the chair.  I had on my respirator
and knew that I breathed freely.  The Nurse sat in her chair with her
back toward me.  She sat quite still.  The sick man lay as still as the
dead.  It was rather like the picture of a scene than the reality; all
were still and silent; and the stillness and silence were continuous.
Outside, in the distance I could hear the sounds of a city, the
occasional roll of wheels, the shout of a reveller, the far-away echo of
whistles and the rumbling of trains.  The light was very, very low; the
reflection of it under the green-shaded lamp was a dim relief to the
darkness, rather than light.  The green silk fringe of the lamp had
merely the colour of an emerald seen in the moonlight. The room, for all
its darkness, was full of shadows.  It seemed in my whirling thoughts as
though all the real things had become shadows--shadows which moved, for
they passed the dim outline of the high windows.  Shadows which had
sentience. I even thought there was sound, a faint sound as of the mew
of a cat--the rustle of drapery and a metallic clink as of metal faintly
touching metal.  I sat as one entranced.  At last I felt, as in
nightmare, that this was sleep, and that in the passing of its portals
all my will had gone.

All at once my senses were full awake.  A shriek rang in my ears.  The
room was filled suddenly with a blaze of light.  There was the sound of
pistol shots--one, two; and a haze of white smoke in the room.  When my
waking eyes regained their power, I could have shrieked with horror
myself at what I saw before me.





Chapter IV
The Second Attempt

The sight which met my eyes had the horror of a dream within a dream,
with the certainty of reality added.  The room was as I had seen it
last; except that the shadowy look had gone in the glare of the many
lights, and every article in it stood stark and solidly real.

By the empty bed sat Nurse Kennedy, as my eyes had last seen her,
sitting bolt upright in the arm-chair beside the bed.  She had placed a
pillow behind her, so that her back might be erect; but her neck was
fixed as that of one in a cataleptic trance.  She was, to all intents
and purposes, turned into stone.  There was no special expression on her
face--no fear, no horror; nothing such as might be expected of one in
such a condition.  Her open eyes showed neither wonder nor interest.
She was simply a negative existence, warm, breathing, placid; but
absolutely unconscious of the world around her.  The bedclothes were
disarranged, as though the patient had been drawn from under them
without throwing them back.  The corner of the upper sheet hung upon the
floor; close by it lay one of the bandages with which the Doctor had
dressed the wounded wrist. Another and another lay further along the
floor, as though forming a clue to where the sick man now lay.  This was
almost exactly where he had been found on the previous night, under the
great safe.  Again, the left arm lay toward the safe.  But there had
been a new outrage, an attempt had been made to sever the arm close to
the bangle which held the tiny key.  A heavy ""kukri"" knife--one of the
leaf-shaped knives which the Gurkhas and others of the hill tribes of
India use with such effect--had been taken from its place on the wall,
and with it the attempt had been made. It was manifest that just at the
moment of striking, the blow had been arrested, for only the point of
the knife and not the edge of the blade had struck the flesh.  As it
was, the outer side of the arm had been cut to the bone and the blood
was pouring out.  In addition, the former wound in front of the arm had
been cut or torn about terribly, one of the cuts seemed to jet out blood
as if with each pulsation of the heart.  By the side of her father knelt
Miss Trelawny, her white nightdress stained with the blood in which she
knelt.  In the middle of the room Sergeant Daw, in his shirt and
trousers and stocking feet, was putting fresh cartridges into his
revolver in a dazed mechanical kind of way.  His eyes were red and
heavy, and he seemed only half awake, and less than half conscious of
what was going on around him.  Several servants, bearing lights of
various kinds, were clustered round the doorway.

As I rose from my chair and came forward, Miss Trelawny raised her eyes
toward me. When she saw me she shrieked and started to her feet,
pointing towards me.  Never shall I forget the strange picture she made,
with her white drapery all smeared with blood which, as she rose from
the pool, ran in streaks toward her bare feet.  I believe that I had
only been asleep; that whatever influence had worked on Mr. Trelawny and
Nurse Kennedy--and in less degree on Sergeant Daw--had not touched me.
The respirator had been of some service, though it had not kept off the
tragedy whose dire evidences were before me.  I can understand now--I
could understand even then--the fright, added to that which had gone
before, which my appearance must have evoked.  I had still on the
respirator, which covered mouth and nose; my hair had been tossed in my
sleep.  Coming suddenly forward, thus enwrapped and dishevelled, in that
horrified crowd, I must have had, in the strange mixture of lights, an
extraordinary and terrifying appearance.  It was well that I recognised
all this in time to avert another catastrophe; for the half-dazed,
mechanically-acting Detective put in the cartridges and had raised his
revolver to shoot at me when I succeeded in wrenching off the respirator
and shouting to him to hold his hand.  In this also he acted
mechanically; the red, half-awake eyes had not in them even then the
intention of conscious action.  The danger, however, was averted.  The
relief of the situation, strangely enough, came in a simple fashion.
Mrs. Grant, seeing that her young mistress had on only her nightdress,
had gone to fetch a dressing-gown, which she now threw over her.  This
simple act brought us all back to the region of fact.  With a long
breath, one and all seemed to devote themselves to the most pressing
matter before us, that of staunching the flow of blood from the arm of
the wounded man.  Even as the thought of action came, I rejoiced; for
the bleeding was very proof that Mr. Trelawny still lived.

Last night's lesson was not thrown away.  More than one of those present
knew now what to do in such an emergency, and within a few seconds
willing hands were at work on a tourniquet.  A man was at once
despatched for the doctor, and several of the servants disappeared to
make themselves respectable.  We lifted Mr. Trelawny on to the sofa
where he had lain yesterday; and, having done what we could for him,
turned our attention to the Nurse.  In all the turmoil she had not
stirred; she sat there as before, erect and rigid, breathing softly and
naturally and with a placid smile. As it was manifestly of no use to
attempt anything with her till the doctor had come, we began to think of
the general situation.

Mrs. Grant had by this time taken her mistress away and changed her
clothes; for she was back presently in a dressing-gown and slippers, and
with the traces of blood removed from her hands.  She was now much
calmer, though she trembled sadly; and her face was ghastly white.  When
she had looked at her father's wrist, I holding the tourniquet, she
turned her eyes round the room, resting them now and again on each one
of us present in turn, but seeming to find no comfort.  It was so
apparent to me that she did not know where to begin or whom to trust
that, to reassure her, I said:

""I am all right now; I was only asleep.""  Her voice had a gulp in it as
she said in a low voice:

""Asleep!  You! and my Father in danger!  I thought you were on the
watch!""  I felt the sting of justice in the reproach; but I really
wanted to help her, so I answered:

""Only asleep.  It is bad enough, I know; but there is something more
than an ""only"" round us here.  Had it not been that I took a definite
precaution I might have been like the Nurse there.""  She turned her eyes
swiftly on the weird figure, sitting grimly upright like a painted
statue; and then her face softened.  With the action of habitual
courtesy she said:

""Forgive me!  I did not mean to be rude.  But I am in such distress and
fear that I hardly know what I am saying.  Oh, it is dreadful!  I fear
for fresh trouble and horror and mystery every moment.""  This cut me to
the very heart, and out of the heart's fulness I spoke:

""Don't give me a thought!  I don't deserve it.  I was on guard, and yet
I slept.  All that I can say is that I didn't mean to, and I tried to
avoid it; but it was over me before I knew it.  Anyhow, it is done now;
and can't be undone.  Probably some day we may understand it all; but
now let us try to get at some idea of what has happened.  Tell me what
you remember!""  The effort to recollect seemed to stimulate her; she
became calmer as she spoke:

""I was asleep, and woke suddenly with the same horrible feeling on me
that Father was in great and immediate danger.  I jumped up and ran,
just as I was, into his room.  It was nearly pitch dark, but as I opened
the door there was light enough to see Father's nightdress as he lay on
the floor under the safe, just as on that first awful night.  Then I
think I must have gone mad for a moment.""  She stopped and shuddered.
My eyes lit on Sergeant Daw, still fiddling in an aimless way with the
revolver.  Mindful of my work with the tourniquet, I said calmly:

""Now tell us, Sergeant Daw, what did you fire at?""  The policeman seemed
to pull himself together with the habit of obedience.  Looking around at
the servants remaining in the room, he said with that air of importance
which, I take it, is the regulation attitude of an official of the law
before strangers:

""Don't you think, sir, that we can allow the servants to go away?  We
can then better go into the matter.""  I nodded approval; the servants
took the hint and withdrew, though unwillingly, the last one closing the
door behind him.  Then the Detective went on:

""I think I had better tell you my impressions, sir, rather than recount
my actions. That is, so far as I remember them.""  There was a mortified
deference now in his manner, which probably arose from his consciousness
of the awkward position in which he found himself.  ""I went to sleep
half-dressed--as I am now, with a revolver under my pillow.  It was the
last thing I remember thinking of.  I do not know how long I slept.  I
had turned off the electric light, and it was quite dark.  I thought I
heard a scream; but I can't be sure, for I felt thick-headed as a man
does when he is called too soon after an extra long stretch of work.
Not that such was the case this time.  Anyhow my thoughts flew to the
pistol.  I took it out, and ran on to the landing.  Then I heard a sort
of scream, or rather a call for help, and ran into this room.  The room
was dark, for the lamp beside the Nurse was out, and the only light was
that from the landing, coming through the open door.  Miss Trelawny was
kneeling on the floor beside her father, and was screaming.  I thought I
saw something move between me and the window; so, without thinking, and
being half dazed and only half awake, I shot at it.  It moved a little
more to the right between the windows, and I shot again.  Then you came
up out of the big chair with all that muffling on your face.  It seemed
to me, being as I say half dazed and half awake--I know, sir, you will
take this into account--as if it had been you, being in the same
direction as the thing I had fired at.  And so I was about to fire again
when you pulled off the wrap.""  Here I asked him--I was cross-examining
now and felt at home:

""You say you thought I was the thing you fired at.  What thing?""  The
man scratched his head, but made no reply.

""Come, sir,"" I said, ""what thing; what was it like?""  The answer came in
a low voice:

""I don't know, sir.  I thought there was something; but what it was, or
what it was like, I haven't the faintest notion.  I suppose it was
because I had been thinking of the pistol before I went to sleep, and
because when I came in here I was half dazed and only half awake--which I
hope you will in future, sir, always remember.""  He clung to that
formula of excuse as though it were his sheet-anchor.  I did not want to
antagonise the man; on the contrary I wanted to have him with us.
Besides, I had on me at that time myself the shadow of my own default;
so I said as kindly as I knew how:

""Quite right! Sergeant.  Your impulse was correct; though of course in
the half-somnolent condition in which you were, and perhaps partly
affected by the same influence--whatever it may be--which made me sleep
and which has put the Nurse in that cataleptic trance, it could not be
expected that you would paused to weigh matters.  But now, whilst the
matter is fresh, let me see exactly where you stood and where I sat.  We
shall be able to trace the course of your bullets.""  The prospect of
action and the exercise of his habitual skill seemed to brace him at
once; he seemed a different man as he set about his work.  I asked Mrs.
Grant to hold the tourniquet, and went and stood where he had stood and
looked where, in the darkness, he had pointed.  I could not but notice
the mechanical exactness of his mind, as when he showed me where he had
stood, or drew, as a matter of course, the revolver from his pistol
pocket, and pointed with it.  The chair from which I had risen still
stood in its place.  Then I asked him to point with his hand only, as I
wished to move in the track of his shot.

Just behind my chair, and a little back of it, stood a high buhl
cabinet.  The glass door was shattered.  I asked:

""Was this the direction of your first shot or your second?""  The answer
came promptly.

""The second; the first was over there!""

He turned a little to the left, more toward the wall where the great
safe stood, and pointed.  I followed the direction of his hand and came
to the low table whereon rested, amongst other curios, the mummy of the
cat which had raised Silvio's ire.  I got a candle and easily found the
mark of the bullet.  It had broken a little glass vase and a tazza of
black basalt, exquisitely engraved with hieroglyphics, the graven lines
being filled with some faint green cement and the whole thing being
polished to an equal surface.  The bullet, flattened against the wall,
lay on the table.

I then went to the broken cabinet.  It was evidently a receptacle for
valuable curios; for in it were some great scarabs of gold, agate, green
jasper, amethyst, lapis lazuli, opal, granit, and blue-green china.
None of these things happily were touched.  The bullet had gone through
the back of the cabinet; but no other damage, save the shattering of the
glass, had been done.  I could not but notice the strange arrangement of
the curios on the shelf of the cabinet.  All the scarabs, rings,
amulets, &c. were arranged in an uneven oval round an exquisitely-carved
golden miniature figure of a hawk-headed God crowned with a disk and
plumes.  I did not wait to look further at present, for my attention was
demanded by more pressing things; but I determined to make a more minute
examination when I should have time.  It was evident that some of the
strange Egyptian smell clung to these old curios; through the broken
glass came an added whiff of spice and gum and bitumen, almost stronger
than those I had already noticed as coming from others in the room.

All this had really taken but a few minutes.  I was surprised when my
eye met, through the chinks between the dark window blinds and the
window cases, the brighter light of the coming dawn.  When I went back
to the sofa and took the tourniquet from Mrs. Grant, she went over and
pulled up the blinds.

It would be hard to imagine anything more ghastly than the appearance of
the room with the faint grey light of early morning coming in upon it.
As the windows faced north, any light that came was a fixed grey light
without any of the rosy possibility of dawn which comes in the eastern
quarter of heaven.  The electric lights seemed dull and yet glaring; and
every shadow was of a hard intensity.  There was nothing of morning
freshness; nothing of the softness of night.  All was hard and cold and
inexpressibly dreary.  The face of the senseless man on the sofa seemed
of a ghastly yellow; and the Nurse's face had taken a suggestion of
green from the shade of the lamp near her.  Only Miss Trelawny's face
looked white; and it was of a pallor which made my heart ache.  It
looked as if nothing on God's earth could ever again bring back to it
the colour of life and happiness.

It was a relief to us all when Doctor Winchester came in, breathless
with running.  He only asked one question:

""Can anyone tell me anything of how this wound was gotten?""  On seeing
the headshake which went round us under his glance, he said no more, but
applied himself to his surgical work.  For an instant he looked up at
the Nurse sitting so still; but then bent himself to his task, a grave
frown contracting his brows.  It was not till the arteries were tied and
the wounds completely dressed that he spoke again, except, of course,
when he had asked for anything to be handed to him or to be done for
him.  When Mr. Trelawny's wounds had been thoroughly cared for, he said
to Miss Trelawny:

""What about Nurse Kennedy?""  She answered at once:

""I really do not know.  I found her when I came into the room at
half-past two o'clock, sitting exactly as she does now.  We have not
moved her, or changed her position.  She has not wakened since.  Even
Sergeant Daw's pistol-shots did not disturb her.""

""Pistol-shots?  Have you then discovered any cause for this new
outrage?""  The rest were silent, so I answered:

""We have discovered nothing.  I was in the room watching with the Nurse.
Earlier in the evening I fancied that the mummy smells were making me
drowsy, so I went out and got a respirator.  I had it on when I came on
duty; but it did not keep me from going to sleep.  I awoke to see the
room full of people; that is, Miss Trelawny and Sergeant Daw, being only
half awake and still stupefied by the same scent or influence which had
affected us, fancied that he saw something moving through the shadowy
darkness of the room, and fired twice.  When I rose out of my chair,
with my face swathed in the respirator, he took me for the cause of the
trouble.  Naturally enough, he was about to fire again, when I was
fortunately in time to manifest my identity.  Mr. Trelawny was lying
beside the safe, just as he was found last night; and was bleeding
profusely from the new wound in his wrist.  We lifted him on the sofa,
and made a tourniquet.  That is, literally and absolutely, all that any
of us know as yet.  We have not touched the knife, which you see lies
close by the pool of blood. Look!"" I said, going over and lifting it.
""The point is red with the blood which has dried.""

Doctor Winchester stood quite still a few minutes before speaking:

""Then the doings of this night are quite as mysterious as those of last
night?""

""Quite!"" I answered.  He said nothing in reply, but turning to Miss
Trelawny said:

""We had better take Nurse Kennedy into another room.  I suppose there is
nothing to prevent it?""

""Nothing!  Please, Mrs. Grant, see that Nurse Kennedy's room is ready;
and ask two of the men to come and carry her in.""  Mrs. Grant went out
immediately; and in a few minutes came back saying:

""The room is quite ready; and the men are here.""  By her direction two
footmen came into the room and, lifting up the rigid body of Nurse
Kennedy under the supervision of the Doctor, carried her out of the
room.  Miss Trelawny remained with me in the sick chamber, and Mrs.
Grant went with the Doctor into the Nurse's room.

When we were alone Miss Trelawny came over to me, and taking both my
hands in hers, said:

""I hope you won't remember what i said.  I did not mean it, and I was
distraught.""  I did not make reply; but I held her hands and kissed
them.  There are different ways of kissing a lady's hands.  This way was
intended as homage and respect; and it was accepted as such in the
high-bred, dignified way which marked Miss Trelawny's bearing and every
movement.  I went over to the sofa and looked down at the senseless man.
The dawn had come much nearer in the last few minutes, and there was
something of the clearness of day in the light.  As I looked at the
stern, cold, set face, now as white as a marble monument in the pale
grey light, i could not but feel that there was some deep mystery beyond
all that had happened within the last twenty-six hours.  Those beetling
brows screened some massive purpose; that high, broad forehead held some
finished train of reasoning, which the broad chin and massive jaw would
help to carry into effect.  As I looked and wondered, there began to
steal over me again that phase of wandering thought which had last night
heralded the approach of sleep.  I resisted it, and held myself sternly
to the present.  This was easier to do when Miss Trelawny came close to
me, and, leaning her forehead against my shoulder, began to cry
silently.  Then all the manhood in me woke, and to present purpose.  It
was of little use trying to speak; words were inadequate to thought. But
we understood each other; she did not draw away when I put arm
protectingly over her shoulder as I used to do with my little sister
long ago when in her childish trouble she would come to her big brother
to be comforted.  That very act or attitude of protection made me more
resolute in my purpose, and seemed to clear my brain of idle, dreamy
wandering in thought.  With an instinct of greater protection, however,
I took away my arm as I heard the Doctor's footstep outside the door.

When Doctor Winchester came in he looked intently at the patient before
speaking. His brows were set, and his mouth was a thin, hard line.
Presently he said:

""There is much in common between the sleep of your Father and Nurse
Kennedy. Whatever influence has brought it about has probably worked the
same way in both cases.  In Kennedy's case the coma is less marked.  I
cannot but feel, however, that with her we may be able to do more and
more quickly than with this patient, as our hands are not tied.  I have
placed her in a draught; and already she shows some signs, though very
faint ones, of ordinary unconsciousness.  The rigidity of her limbs is
less, and her skin seems more sensitive--or perhaps I should say less
insensitive--to pain.""

""How is it, then,"" I asked, ""that Mr. Trelawny is still in this state of
insensibility; and yet, so far as we know, his body has not had such
rigidity at all?""

""That I cannot answer.  The problem is one which we may solve in a few
hours; or it may need a few days.  But it will be a useful lesson in
diagnosis to us all; and perhaps to many and many others after us, who
knows!"" he added, with the genuine fire of an enthusiast.

As the morning wore on, he flitted perpetually between the two rooms,
watching anxiously over both patients.  He made Mrs. Grant remain with
the Nurse, but either Miss Trelawny or I, generally both of us, remained
with the wounded man. We each managed, however, to get bathed and
dressed; the Doctor and Mrs. Grant remained with Mr. Trelawny whilst we
had breakfast.

Sergeant Daw went off to report at Scotland Yard the progress of the
night; and then to the local station to arrange for the coming of his
comrade, Wright, as fixed with Superintendent Dolan.  When he returned I
could not but think that he had been hauled over the coals for shooting
in a sick-room; or perhaps for shooting at all without certain and
proper cause.  His remark to me enlightened me in the matter:

""A good character is worth something, sir, in spite of what some of them
say.  See! I've still got leave to carry my revolver.""

That day was a long and anxious one.  Toward nightfall Nurse Kennedy so
far improved that the rigidity of her limbs entirely disappeared.  She
still breathed quietly and regularly; but the fixed expression of her
face, though it was a calm enough expression, gave place to fallen
eyelids and the negative look of sleep. Doctor Winchester had, towards
evening, brought two more nurses, one of whom was to remain with Nurse
Kennedy and the other to share in the watching with Miss Trelawny, who
had insisted on remaining up herself.  She had, in order to prepare for
the duty, slept for several hours in the afternoon.  We had all taken
counsel together, and had arranged thus for the watching in Mr.
Trelawny's room.  Mrs. Grant was to remain beside the patient till
twelve, when Miss Trelawny would relieve her.  The new nurse was to sit
in Miss Trelawny's room, and to visit the sick chamber each quarter of
an hour.  The Doctor would remain till twelve; when I was to relieve
him.  One or other of the detectives was to remain within hail of the
room all night; and to pay periodical visits to see that all was well.
Thus, the watchers would be watched; and the possibility of such events
as last night, when the watchers were both overcome, would be avoided.

When the sun set, a strange and grave anxiety fell on all of us; and in
our separate ways we prepared for the vigil.  Doctor Winchester had
evidently been thinking of my respirator, for he told me he would go out
and get one.  Indeed, he took to the idea so kindly that I persuaded
Miss Trelawny also to have one which she could put on when her time for
watching came.

And so the night drew on.





Chapter V
More Strange Instructions

When I came from my room at half-past eleven o'clock I found all well in
the sick-room.  The new nurse, prim, neat, and watchfull, sat in the
chair by the bedside where Nurse Kennedy had sat last night.  A little
way off, between the bed and the safe, sat Dr. Winchester alert and
wakeful, but looking strange and almost comic with the respirator over
mouth and nose.  As I stood in the doorway looking at them I heard a
slight sound; turning round I saw the new detective, who nodded, held up
the finger of silence and withdrew quietly.  Hitherto no one of the
watchers was overcome by sleep.

I took a chair outside the door.  As yet there was no need for me to
risk coming again under the subtle influence of last night.  Naturally
my thoughts went revolving round the main incidents of the last day and
night, and I found myself arriving at strange conclusions, doubts,
conjectures; but I did not lose myself, as on last night, in trains of
thought.  The sense of the present was ever with me, and I really felt
as should a sentry on guard.  Thinking is not a slow process; and when
it is earnest the time can pass quickly.  It seemed a very short time
indeed till the door, usually left ajar, was pulled open and Dr.
Winchester emerged, taking off his respirator as he came.  His act, when
he had it off, was demostrative of his keenness.  He turned up the
outside of the wrap and smelled it carefully.

""I am going now,"" he said.  ""I shall come early in the morning; unless,
of course, I am sent for before.  But all seems well tonight.""

The next to appear was Sergeant Daw, who went quietly into the room and
took the seat vacated by the Doctor.  I still remained outside; but
every few minutes looked into the room.  This was rather a form than a
matter of utility, for the room was so dark that coming even from the
dimly-lighted corridor it was hard to distinguish anything.

A little before twelve o'clock Miss Trelawny came from her room.  Before
coming to her father's she went into that occupied by Nurse Kennedy.
After a couple of minutes she came out, looking, I thought, a trifle
more cheerful.  She had her respirator in her hand, but before putting
it on, asked me if anything special had occurred since she had gone to
lie down.  I answered in a whisper--there was no loud talking in the
house tonight--that all was safe, was well.  She then put on her
respirator, and I mine; and we entered the room.  The Detective and the
Nurse rose up, and we took their places.  Sergeant Daw was the last to
go out; he closed the door behind him as we had arranged.

For a while I sat quiet, my heart beating.  The place was grimly dark.
The only light was a faint one from the top of the lamp which threw a
white circle on the high ceiling, except the emerald sheen of the shade
as the light took its under edges. Even the light only seemed to
emphasize the blackness of the shadows.  These presently began to seem,
as on last night, to have a sentience of their own.  I did not myself
feel in the least sleepy; and each time I went softly over to look at
the patient, which I did about every ten minutes, I could see that Miss
Trelawny was keenly alert.  Every quarter of an hour one or other of the
policemen looked in through the partly opened door.  Each time both Miss
Trelawny and I said through our mufflers, ""all right,"" and the door was
closed again.

As the time wore on, the silence and the darkness seemed to increase.
The circle of light on the ceiling was still there, but it seemed less
brilliant than at first.  The green edging of the lamp-shade became like
Maori greenstone rather than emerald. The sounds of the night without
the house, and the starlight spreading pale lines along the edges of the
window-cases, made the pall of black within more solemn and more
mysterious.

We heard the clock in the corridor chiming the quarters with its silver
bell till two o'clock; and then a strange feeling came over me.  I could
see from Miss Trelawny's movement as she looked round, that she also had
some new sensation.  The new detective had just looked in; we two were
alone with the unconscious patient for another quarter of an hour.

My heart began to beat wildly.  There was a sense of fear over me.  Not
for myself; my fear was impersonal.  It seemed as though some new person
had entered the room, and that a strong intelligence was awake close to
me.  Something brushed against my leg.  I put my hand down hastily and
touched the furry coat of Silvio. With a very faint far-away sound of a
snarl he turned and scratched at me.  I felt blood on my hand.  I rose
gently and came over to the bedside.  Miss Trelawny, too, had stood up
and was looking behind her, as though there was something close to her.
Her eyes were wild, and her breast rose and fell as though she were
fighting for air. When I touched her she did not seem to feel me; she
worked her hands in front of her, as though she was fending off
something.

There was not an instant to lose.  I seized her in my arms and rushed
over to the door, threw it open, and strode into the passage, calling
loudly:

""Help!  Help!""

In an instant the two Detectives, Mrs. Grant, and the Nurse appeared on
the scene. Close on their heels came several of the servants, both men
and women. Immediately Mrs. Grant came near enough, I placed Miss
Trelawny in her arms, and rushed back into the room, turning up the
electric light as soon as I could lay my hand on it.  Sergeant Daw and
the Nurse followed me.

We were just in time.  Close under the great safe, where on the two
succesive nights he had been found, lay Mr. Trelawny with his left arm,
bare save for the bandages, stretched out.  Close by his side was a
leaf-shaped Egyptian knife which had lain amongst the curios on the
shelf of the broken cabinet.  Its point was stuck in the parquet floor,
whence had been removed the blood-stained rug.

But there was no sign of disturbance anywhere; nor any sign of any one
or anything unusual.  The Policemen and I searched the room accurately,
whilst the Nurse and two of the servants lifted the wounded man back to
bed; but no sign or clue could we get.  Very soon Miss Trelawny returned
to the room.  She was pale but collected. When she came close to me she
said in a low voice:

""I felt myself fainting.  I did not know why; but I was afraid!""

The only other shock I had was when Miss Trelawny cried out to me, as I
placed my hand on the bed to lean over and look carefully at her father:

""You are wounded.  Look! look! your hand is bloody.  There is blood on
the sheets!"" I had, in the excitement, quite forgotten Silvio's scratch.
As I looked at it, the recollection came back to me; but before I could
say a word Miss Trelawny had caught hold of my hand and lifted it up.
When she saw the parallel lines of the cuts she cried out again:

""It is the same wound as Father's!""  Then she laid my hand down gently
but quickly, and said to me and to Sergeant Daw:

""Come to my room!  Silvio is there in his basket.""  We followed her, and
found Silvio sitting in his basket awake.  He was licking his paws.  The
Detective said:

""He is there sure enough; but why licking his paws?""

Margaret--Miss Trelawny--gave a moan as she bent over and took one of
the forepaws in her hand; but the cat seemed to resent it and snarled.
At that Mrs. Grant came into the room.  When she saw that we were
looking at the cat she said:

""The Nurse tells me that Silvio was asleep on Nurse Kennedy's bed ever
since you went to your Father's room until a while ago.  He came there
just after you had gone to master's room.  Nurse says that Nurse Kennedy
is moaning and muttering in her sleep as though she had a nightmare.  I
think we should send for Dr. Winchester.""

""Do so at once, please!"" said Miss Trelawny; and we went back to the
room.

For a while Miss Trelawny stood looking at her father, with her brows
wrinkled. Then, turning to me, as though her mind were made up, she
said:

""Don't you think we should have a consultation on Father?  Of course I
have every confidence in Doctor Winchester; he seems an immensely clever
young man.  But he is a young man; and there must be men who have
devoted themselves to this branch of science.  Such a man would have
more knowledge and more experience; and his knowledge and experience
might help to throw light on poor Father's case. As it is, Doctor
Winchester seems to be quite in the dark.  Oh! I don't know what to do.
It is all so terrible!""  Here she broke down a little and cried; and I
tried to comfort her.

Doctor Winchester arrived quickly.  His first thought was for his
patient; but when he found him without further harm, he visited Nurse
Kennedy.  When he saw her, a hopeful look came into his eyes.  Taking a
towel, he dipped a corner of it in cold water and flicked on the face.
The skin coloured, and she stirred slightly.  He said to the new nurse--
Sister Doris he called her:

""She is all right.  She will wake in a few hours at latest.  She may be
dizzy and distraught at first, or perhaps hysterical.  If so, you know
how to treat her.""

""Yes, sir!"" answered Sister Doris demurely; and we went back to Mr.
Trelawny's room. As soon as we had entered, Mrs. Grant and the Nurse
went out so that only Doctor Winchester, Miss Trelawny, and myself
remained in the room.  When the door had been closed Doctor Winchester
asked me as to what had occurred.  I told him fully, giving exactly
every detail so far as I could remember.  Throughout my narrative, which
did not take long, however, he kept asking me questions as to who had
been present and the order in which each one had come into the room.  He
asked other things, but nothing of any importance; these were all that
took my attention, or remained in my memory.  When our conversation was
finished, he said in a very decided way indeed, to Miss Trelawny:

""I think, Miss Trelawny, that we had better have a consultation on this
case.""  She answered at once, seemingly a little to his surprise:

""I am glad you have mentioned it.  I quite agree.  Who would you
suggest?""

""Have you any choice yourself?"" he asked.  ""Any one to whom your Father
is known? Has he ever consulted any one?""

""Not to my knowledge.  But I hope you will choose whoever you think
would be best.  My dear Father should have all the help that can be had;
and I shall be deeply obliged by your choosing.  Who is the best man in
London--anywhere else--in such a case?""

""There are several good men; but they are scattered all over the world.
Somehow, the brain specialist is born, not made; though a lot of hard
work goes to the completing of him and fitting him for his work.  He
comes from no country.  The most daring investigator up to the present
is Chiuni, the Japanese; but he is rather a surgical experimentalist
than a practitioner.  Then there is Zammerfest of Uppsala, and Fenelon
of the University of Paris, and Morfessi of Naples.  These, of course,
are in addition to our own men, Morrison of Aberdeen and Richardson of
Birmingham. But before them all I would put Frere of King's College.  Of
all that I have named he best unites theory and practice.  He has no
hobbies--that have been discovered at all events; and his experience is
immense.  It is the regret of all of us who admire him that the nerve so
firm and the hand so dexterous must yield to time.  For my own part I
would rather have Frere than any one living.""

""Then,"" said Miss Trelawny decisively, ""let us have Doctor Frere--by the
way, is he 'Doctor' or 'Mister'?--as early as we can get him in the
morning!""

A weight seemed removed from him, and he spoke with greater ease and
geniality than he had yet shown:

""He is Sir James Frere.  I shall go to him myself as early as it is
possibly to see him, and shall ask him to come here at once.""  Then
turning to me he said:

""You had better let me dress your hand.""

""It is nothing,"" I said.

""Nevertheless it should be seen to.  A scratch from any animal might
turn out dangerous; there is nothing like being safe.""  I submitted;
forthwith he began to dress my hand.  He examined with a
magnifying-glass the several parallel wounds, and compared them with the
slip of blotting-paper, marked with Silvio's claws, which he took from
his pocket-book.  He put back the paper, simply remarking:

""It's a pity that Silvio slips in--and out--just when he shouldn't.""

The morning wore slowly on.  By ten o'clock Nurse Kennedy had so far
recovered that she was able to sit up and talk intelligibly.  But she
was still hazy in her thoughts; and could not remember anything that had
happened on the previous night, after her taking her place by the
sick-bed.  As yet she seemed neither to know nor care what had happened.

It was nearly eleven o'clock when Doctor Winchester returned with Sir
James Frere. Somehow I felt my heart sink when from the landing I saw
them in the hall below; I knew that Miss Trelawny was to have the pain
of telling yet another stranger of her ignorance of her father's life.

Sir James Frere was a man who commanded attention followed by respect.
He knew so thoroughly what he wanted himself, that he placed at once on
one side all wishes and ideas of less definite persons.  The mere flash
of his piercing eyes, or the set of his resolute mouth, or the lowering
of his great eyebrows, seemed to compel immediate and willing obedience
to his wishes.  Somehow, when we had all been introduced and he was well
amongst us, all sense of mystery seemed to melt away.  It was with a
hopeful spirit that I saw him pass into the sick-room with Doctor
Winchester.

They remained in the room a long time; once they sent for the Nurse, the
new one, Sister Doris, but she did not remain long.  Again they both
went into Nurse Kennedy's room.  He sent out the nurse attendant on her.
Doctor Winchester told me afterward that Nurse Kennedy, though she was
ignorant of later matters, gave full and satisfactory answers to all
Doctor Frere's questions relating to her patient up to the time she
became unconscious.  Then they went to the study, where they remained so
long, and their voices raised in heated discussion seemed in such
determined opposition, that I began to feel uneasy.  As for Miss
Trelawny, she was almost in a state of collapse from nervousness before
they joined us.  Poor girl! she had had a sadly anxious time of it, and
her nervous strength had almost broken down.

They came out at last, Sir James first, his grave face looking as
unenlightening as that of the sphinx.  Doctor Winchester followed him
closely; his face was pale, but with that kind of pallor which looked
like a reaction.  It gave me the idea that it had been red not long
before.  Sir James asked that Miss Trelawny would come into the study.
He suggested that I should come also.  When we had enterd, Sir James
turned to me and said:

""I understand from Doctor Winchester that you are a friend of Miss
Trelawny, and that you have already considerable knowledge of this case.
Perhaps it will be well that you should be with us.  I know you already
as a keen lawyer, Mr. Ross, though I never had the pleasure of meeting
you.  As Doctor Winchester tells me that there are some strange matters
outside this case which seem to puzzle him--and others--and in which he
thinks you may yet be specially interested, it might be as well that you
should know every phase of the case.  For myself I do not take much
account of mysteries--except those of science; and as there seems to be
some idea of an attempt at assassination or robbery, all I can say is
that if assassins were at work they ought to take some elementary
lessons in anatomy before their next job, for they seem thoroughly
ignorant.  If robbery were their purpose, they seem to have worked with
marvellous inefficiency.  That, however, is not my business.""  Here he
took a big pinch of snuff, and turning to to Miss Trelawny, went on:
""Now as to the patient. Leaving out the cause of his illness, all we can
say at present is that he appears to be suffering from a marked attack
of catalepsy.  At present nothing can be done, except to sustain his
strength.  The treatment of my friend Doctor Winchester is mainly such
as I approve of; and I am confident that should any slight change arise
he will be able to deal with it satisfactorily.  It is an interesting
case--most interesting; and should any new or abnormal development arise
I shall be happy to come at any time.  There is just one thing to which
I wish to call your attention; and I put it to you, Miss Trelawny,
directly, since it is your responsibility.  Doctor Winchester informs me
that you are not yourself free in the matter, but are bound by an
instruction given by your Father in case just such a condition of things
should arise.  I would strongly advise that the patient be removed to
another room; or, as an alternative, that those mummies and all such
things should be removed from his chamber.  Why, it's enough to put any
man into an abnormal condition, to have such an assemblage of horrors
round him, and to breathe the atmosphere which they exhale.  You have
evidence already of how such mephitic odour may act.  That nurse--
Kennedy, I think you said, Doctor--isn't yet out of her state of
catalepsy; and you, Mr. Ross, have, I am told, experienced something of
the same effects.  I know this""--here his eyebrows came down more than
ever, and his mouth hardened--""if I were in charge here I should insist
on the patient having a different atmosphere; or I would throw up the
case.  Doctor Winchester already knows that I can only be again
consulted on this condition being fulfilled.  But I trust that you will
see your way, as a good daughter to my mind should, to looking to your
Father's health and sanity rather than to any whim of his--whether
supported or not by a foregoing fear, or by any number of ""penny
dreadful"" mysteries.  The day has hardly come yet, I am glad to say,
when the British Museum and St. Thomas's Hospital have exchanged their
normal functions.  Good-day, Miss Trelawny.  I earnestly hope that I may
soon see your Father restored.  Remember, that should you fulfil the
elementary condition which I have laid down, I am at your service day or
night.  Good-morning, Mr. Ross.  I hope you will be able to report to me
soon, Doctor Winchester.""

When he had gone we stood silent, till the rumble of his carriage wheels
died away. The first to speak was Doctor Winchester:

""I think it well to say that to my mind, speaking purely as a physician,
he is quite right.  I feel as if I could have assaulted him when he made
it a condition of not giving up the case; but all the same he is right
as to treatment.  He does not understand that there is something odd
about this special case; and he will not realise knot that we are all
tied up in by Mr. Trelawny's instructions.  Of course--"" He was
interrupted by Miss Trelawny:

""Doctor Winchester, do you, too, wish to give up the case; or are you
willing to continue it under the conditions you know?""

""Give it up!  Less now than ever.  Miss Trelawny, I shall never give it
up, so long as life is left to him or any of us!""  She said nothing, but
held out her hand, which he took warmly.

""Now,"" said she, ""if Sir James Frere is a type of the cult of
Specialists, I want no more of them.  To start with, he does not seem to
know any more than you do about my Father's condition; and if he were a
hundredth part as much interested in it as you are, he would not stand
on such punctilio.  Of course, I am only too anxious about my poor
Father; and if I can see a way to meet either of Sir James Frere's
conditions, I shall do so.  I shall ask Mr. Marvin to come here today,
and advise me as to the limit of Father's wishes.  If he thinks I am
free to act in any way on my own responsibility, I shall not hesitate to
do so.""  Then Doctor Winchester took his leave.

Miss Trelawny sat down and wrote a letter to Mr. Marvin, telling him of
the state of affairs, and asking him to come and see her and to bring
with him any papers which might throw any light on the subject.  She
sent the letter off with a carriage to bring back the solicitor; we
waited with what patience we could for his coming.

It is not a very long journey for oneself from Kensington Palace Gardens
to Lincoln's Inn Fields; but it seemed endlessly long when waiting for
someone else to take it.  All things, however, are amenable to Time; it
was less than an hour all told when Mr. Marvin was with us.

He recognised Miss Trelawny's impatience, and when he had learned
sufficient of her father's illness, he said to her:

""Whenever you are ready I can go with you into particulars regarding
your Father's wishes.""

""Whenever you like,"" she said, with an evident ignorance of his meaning.
""Why not now?""  He looked at me, as to a fellow man of business, and
stammered out:

""We are not alone.""

""I have brought Mr. Ross here on purpose,"" she answered.  ""He knows so
much at present, that I want him to know more.""  The solicitor was a
little disconcerted, a thing which those knowing him only in courts
would hardly have believed.  He answered, however, with some hesitation:

""But, my dear young lady--Your Father's wishes!--Confidence between father
and child--""

Here she interrupted him; there was a tinge of red in her pale cheeks as
she did so:

""Do you really think that applies to the present circumstances, Mr.
Marvin?  My Father never told me anything of his affairs; and I can now,
in this sad extremity, only learn his wishes through a gentleman who is
a stranger to me and of whom I never even heard till I got my Father's
letter, written to be shown to me only in extremity.  Mr. Ross is a new
friend; but he has all my confidence, and I should like him to be
present.  Unless, of course,"" she added, 'such a thing is forbidden by
my Father.  Oh! forgive me, Mr. Marvin, if I seem rude; but I have been
in such dreadful trouble and anxiety lately, that I have hardly command
of myself.""  She covered her eyes with her hand for a few seconds; we
two men looked at each other and waited, trying to appear unmoved.  She
went on more firmly; she had recovered herself:

""Please! please do not think I am ungrateful to you for your kindness in
coming here and so quickly.  I really am grateful; and I have every
confidence in your judgment.  If you wish, or think it best, we can be
alone.""  I stood up; but Mr. Marvin made a dissentient gesture.  He was
evidently pleased with her attitude; there was geniality in his voice
and manner as he spoke:

""Not at all!  Not at all!  There is no restriction on your Father's
part; and on my own I am quite willing.  Indeed, all told, it may be
better.  From what you have said of Mr. Trelawny's illness, and the
other--incidental--matters, it will be well in case of any grave
eventuality, that it was understood from the first, that circumstances
were ruled by your Father's own imperative instructions.  For, please
understand me, his instructions are imperative--most imperative.  They
are so unyielding that he has given me a Power of Attorney, under which
I have undertaken to act, authorising me to see his written wishes
carried out.  Please believe me once for all, that he intended fully
everything mentioned in that letter to you!  Whilst he is alive he is to
remain in his own room; and none of his property is to be removed from
it under any circumstances whatever.  He has even given an inventory of
the articles which are not to be displaced.""

Miss Trelawny was silent.  She looked somewhat distressed; so, thinking
that I understood the immediate cause, I asked:

""May we see the list?""  Miss Trelawny's face at once brightened; but it
fell again as the lawyer answered promptly--he was evidently prepared for
the question:

""Not unless I am compelled to take action on the Power of Attorney.  I
have brought that instrument with me.  You will recognise, Mr. Ross""--he
said this with a sort of business conviction which I had noticed in his
professional work, as he handed me the deed--""how strongly it is worded,
and how the grantor made his wishes apparent in such a way as to leave
no loophole.  It is his own wording, except for certain legal
formalities; and I assure you I have seldom seen a more iron-clad
document.  Even I myself have no power to make the slightest relaxation
of the instructions, without committing a distinct breach of faith.  And
that, I need not tell you, is impossible."" He evidently added the last
words in order to prevent an appeal to his personal consideration.  He
did not like the seeming harshness of his words, however, for he added:

""I do hope, Miss Trelawny, that you understand that I am willing--
frankly and unequivocally willing--to do anything I can, within the
limits of my power, to relieve your distress.  But your Father had, in
all his doings, some purpose of his own which he did not disclose to me.
So far as I can see, there is not a word of his instructions that he had
not thought over fully.  Whatever idea he had in his mind was the idea
of a lifetime; he had studied it in every possible phase, and was
prepared to guard it at every point.

""Now I fear I have distressed you, and I am truly sorry for it; for I
see you have much--too much--to bear already.  But I have no alternative.
If you want to consult me at any time about anything, I promise you I
will come without a moment's delay, at any hour of the day or night.
There is my private address,"" he scribbled in his pocket-book as he
spoke, ""and under it the address of my club, where I am generally to be
found in the evening.""  He tore out the paper and handed it to her.  She
thanked him.  He shook hands with her and with me and withdrew.

As soon as the hall door was shut on him, Mrs. Grant tapped at the door
and came in. There was such a look of distress in her face that Miss
Trelawny stood up, deadly white, and asked her:

""What is it, Mrs. Grant?  What is it?  Any new trouble?""

""I grieve to say, miss, that the servants, all but two, have given
notice and want to leave the house today.  They have talked the matter
over among themselves; the butler has spoken for the rest.  He says as
how they are willing to forego their wages, and even to pay their legal
obligations instead of notice; but that go today they must.""

""What reason do they give?""

""None, miss.  They say as how they're sorry, but that they've nothing to
say.  I asked Jane, the upper housemaid, miss, who is not with the rest
but stops on; and she tells me confidential that they've got some notion
in their silly heads that the house is haunted!""

We ought to have laughed, but we didn't.  I could not look in Miss
Trelawny's face and laugh.  The pain and horror there showed no sudden
paroxysm of fear; there was a fixed idea of which this was a
confirmation.  For myself, it seemed as if my brain had found a voice.
But the voice was not complete; there was some other thought, darker and
deeper, which lay behind it, whose voice had not sounded as yet.





Chapter VI
Suspicions

The first to get full self-command was Miss Trelawny.  There was a
haughty dignity in her bearing as she said:

""Very well, Mrs. Grant; let them go!  Pay them up to today, and a
month's wages. They have hitherto been very good servants; and the
occasion of their leaving is not an ordinary one.  We must not expect
much faithfulness from any one who is beset with fears.  Those who
remain are to have in future double wages; and please send these to me
presently when I send word.""  Mrs. Grant bristled with smothered
indignation; all the housekeeper in her was outraged by such generous
treatment of servants who had combined to give notice:

""They don't deserve it, miss; them to go on so, after the way they have
been treated here.  Never in my life have I seen servants so well
treated or anyone so good to them and gracious to them as you have been.
They might be in the household of a King for treatment.  And now, just
as there is trouble, to go and act like this.  It's abominable, that's
what it is!""

Miss Trelawny was very gentle with her, and smothered her ruffled
dignity; so that presently she went away with, in her manner, a lesser
measure of hostility to the undeserving.  In quite a different frame of
mind she returned presently to ask if her mistress would like her to
engage a full staff of other servants, or at any rate try to do so.
""For you know, ma'am,"" she went on, ""when once a scare has been
established in the servants"" hall, it's wellnigh impossible to get rid
of it.  Servants may come; but they go away just as quick.  There's no
holding them.  They simply won't stay; or even if they work out their
month's notice, they lead you that life that you wish every hour of the
day that you hadn't kept them.  The women are bad enough, the huzzies;
but the men are worse!""  There was neither anxiety nor indignation in
Miss Trelawny's voice or manner as she said:

""I think, Mrs. Grant, we had better try to do with those we have.
Whilst my dear Father is ill we shall not be having any company, so that
there will be only three now in the house to attend to.  If those
servants who are willing to stay are not enough, I should only get
sufficient to help them to do the work.  It will not, I should think, be
difficult to get a few maids; perhaps some that you know already.  And
please bear in mind, that those whom you get, and who are suitable and
will stay, are henceforth to have the same wages as those who are
remaining.  Of course, Mrs. Grant, you well enough understand that
though I do not group you in any way with the servants, the rule of
double salary applies to you too.""  As she spoke she extended her long,
fine-shaped hand, which the other took and then, raising it to her lips,
kissed it impressively with the freedom of an elder woman to a younger.
I could not but admire the generosity of her treatment of her servants.
In my mind I endorsed Mrs. Grant's sotto voce remark as she left the
room:

""No wonder the house is like a King's house, when the mistress is a
Princess!""

""A Princess!""  That was it.  The idea seemed to satisfy my mind, and to
bring back in a wave of light the first moment when she swept across my
vision at the ball in Belgrave Square.  A queenly figure! tall and slim,
bending, swaying, undulating as the lily or the lotos.  Clad in a
flowing gown of some filmy black material shot with gold. For ornament
in her hair she wore an old Egyptian jewel, a tiny crystal disk, set
between rising plumes carved in lapis lazuli.  On her wrist was a broad
bangle or bracelet of antique work, in the shape of a pair of spreading
wings wrought in gold, with the feathers made of coloured gems.  For all
her gracious bearing toward me, when our hostess introduced me, I was
then afraid of her.  It was only when later, at the picnic on the river,
I had come to realise her sweet and gentle, that my awe changed to
something else.

For a while she sat, making some notes or memoranda.  Then putting them
away, she sent for the faithful servants.  I thought that she had better
have this interview alone, and so left her.  When I came back there were
traces of tears in her eyes.

The next phase in which I had a part was even more disturbing, and
infinitely more painful.  Late in the afternoon Sergeant Daw came into
the study where I was sitting. After closing the door carefully and
looking all round the room to make certain that we were alone, he came
close to me.

""What is it?"" I asked him.  ""I see you wish to speak to me privately.""

""Quite so, sir!  May I speak in absolute confidence?""

""Of course you may.  In anything that is for the good of Miss Trelawny--
and of course Mr. Trelawny--you may be perfectly frank.  I take it that
we both want to serve them to the best of our powers.""  He hesitated
before replying:

""Of course you know that I have my duty to do; and I think you know me
well enough to know that I will do it.  I am a policeman--a detective;
and it is my duty to find out the facts of any case I am put on, without
fear or favour to anyone.  I would rather speak to you alone, in
confidence if I may, without reference to any duty of anyone to anyone,
except mine to Scotland Yard.""

""Of course! of course!"" I answered mechanically, my heart sinking, I did
not know why.  ""Be quite frank with me.  I assure you of my confidence.""

""Thank you, sir.  I take it that what I say is not to pass beyond you--
not to anyone. Not to Miss Trelawny herself, or even to Mr. Trelawny
when he becomes well again.""

""Certainly, if you make it a condition!"" I said a little more stiffly.
The man recognised the change in my voice or manner, and said
apologetically:

""Excuse me, sir, but I am going outside my duty in speaking to you at
all on the subject.  I know you, however, of old; and I feel that I can
trust you.  Not your word, sir, that is all right; but your discretion!""

I bowed.  ""Go on!"" I said.  He began at once:

""I have gone over this case, sir, till my brain begins to reel; but I
can't find any ordinary solution of it.  At the time of each attempt no
one has seemingly come into the house; and certainly no one has got out.
What does it strike you is the inference?""

""That the somebody--or the something--was in the house already,"" I
answered, smiling in spite of myself.

""That's just what I think,"" he said, with a manifest sigh of relief.
""Very well! Who can be that someone?""

""'Someone, or something,' was what I said,"" I answered.

""Let us make it 'someone,' Mr. Ross!  That cat, though he might have
scratched or bit, never pulled the old gentleman out of bed, and tried
to get the bangle with the key off his arm.  Such things are all very
well in books where your amateur detectives, who know everything before
it's done, can fit them into theories; but in Scotland Yard, where the
men aren't all idiots either, we generally find that when crime is done,
or attempted, it's people, not things, that are at the bottom of it.""

""Then make it 'people' by all means, Sergeant.""

""We were speaking of 'someone,' sir.""

""Quite right.  Someone, be it!""

""Did it ever strike you, sir, that on each of the three separate
occasions where outrage was effected, or attempted, there was one person
who was the first to be present and to give the alarm?""

""Let me see!  Miss Trelawny, I believe, gave the alarm on the first
occasion.  I was present myself, if fast asleep, on the second; and so
was Nurse Kennedy.  When I woke there were several people in the room;
you were one of them.  I understand that on that occasion also Miss
Trelawny was before you.  At the last attempt I was Miss Trelawny
fainted.  I carried her out and went back.  In returning, I was first;
and I think you were close behind me.""

Sergeant Daw thought for a moment before replying:

""She was present, or first, in the room on all the occasions; there was
only damage done in the first and second!""

The inference was one which I, as a lawyer, could not mistake.  I
thought the best thing to do was to meet it half-way.  I have always
found that the best way to encounter an inference is to cause it to be
turned into a statement.

""You mean,"" I said, ""that as on the only occasions when actual harm was
done, Miss Trelawny's being the first to discover it is a proof that she
did it; or was in some way connected with the attempt, as well as the
discovery?""

""I didn't venture to put it as clear as that; but that is where the
doubt which I had leads.""  Sergeant Daw was a man of courage; he
evidently did not shrink from any conclusion of his reasoning on facts.

We were both silent for a while.  Fears began crowding in on my own
mind.  Not doubts of Miss Trelawny, or of any act of hers; but fears
lest such acts should be misunderstood.  There was evidently a mystery
somewhere; and if no solution to it could be found, the doubt would be
cast on someone.  In such cases the guesses of the majority are bound to
follow the line of least resistance; and if it could be proved that any
personal gain to anyone could follow Mr. Trelawny's death, should such
ensue, it might prove a difficult task for anyone to prove innocence in
the face of suspicious facts.  I found myself instinctively taking that
deferential course which, until the plan of battle of the prosecution is
unfolded, is so safe an attitude for the defence.  It would never do for
me, at this stage, to combar any theories which a detective might form.
I could best help Miss Trelawny by listening and understanding.  When
the time should come for the dissipation and obliteration of the
theories, I should be quite willing to use all my militant ardour, and
all the weapons at my command.

""You will of course do your duty, I know,"" I said, ""and without fear.
What course do you intend to take?""

""I don't know as yet, sir.  You see, up to now it isn't with me even a
suspicion.  If any one else told me that that sweet young lady had a
hand in such a matter, I would think him a fool; but I am bound to
follow my own conclusions.  I know well that just as unlikely persons
have been proved guilty, when a whole court--all except the prosecution
who knew the facts, and the judge who had taught his mind to wait--would
have sworn to innocence.  I wouldn't, for all the world, wrong such a
young lady; more especial when she has such a cruel weight to bear.  And
you will be sure that I won't say a word that'll prompt anyone else to
make such a charge.  That's why I speak to you in confidence, man to
man.  You are skilled in proofs; that is your profession.  Mine only
gets so far as suspicions, and what we call our own proofs--which are
nothing but ex parte evidence after all.  You know Miss Trelawny better
than I do; and though I watch round the sick-room, and go where I like
about the house and in and out of it, I haven't the same opportunities
as you have of knowing the lady and what her life is, or her means are;
or of anything else which might give me a clue to her actions.  If I
were to try to find out from her, it would at once arouse her
suspicions.  Then, if she were guilty, all possibility of ultimate proof
would go; for she would easily find a way to baffle discovery.  But if
she be innocent, as I hope she is, it would be doing a cruel wrong to
accuse her.  I have thought the matter over according to my lights
before I spoke to you; and if I have taken a liberty, sir, I am truly
sorry.""

""No liberty in the world, Daw,"" I said warmly, for the man's courage and
honesty and consideration compelled respect.  ""I am glad you have spoken
to me so frankly. We both want to find out the truth; and there is so
much about this case that is strange--so strange as to go beyond all
experiences--that to aim at truth is our only chance of making anything
clear in the long-run--no matter what our views are, or what object we
wish to achieve ultimately!""  The Sergeant looked pleased as he went on:

""I thought, therefore, that if you had it once in your mind that
somebody else held to such a possibility, you would by degrees get
proof; or at any rate such ideas as would convince yourself, either for
or against it.  Then we would come to some conclusion; or at any rate we
should so exhaust all other possibilities that the most likely one would
remain as the nearest thing to proof, or strong suspicion, that we could
get. After that we should have to--""

Just at this moment the door opened and Miss Trelawny entered the room.
The moment she saw us she drew back quickly, saying:

""Oh, I beg pardon!  I did not know you were here, and engaged.""  By the
time I had stood up, she was about to go back.

""Do come in,"" I said; ""Sergeant Daw and I were only talking matters
over.""

Whilst she was hesitating, Mrs. Grant appeared, saying as she entered
the room: ""Doctor Winchester is come, miss, and is asking for you.""

I obeyed Miss Trelawny's look; together we left the room.

When the Doctor had made his examination, he told us that there was
seemingly no change.  He added that nevertheless he would like to stay
in the house that night is he might.  Miss Trelawny looked glad, and
sent word to Mrs. Grant to get a room ready for him.  Later in the day,
when he and I happened to be alone together, he said suddenly:

""I have arranged to stay here tonight because I want to have a talk
with you.  And as I wish it to be quite private, I thought the least
suspicious way would be to have a cigar together late in the evening
when Miss Trelawny is watching her father.""  We still kept to our
arrangement that either the sick man's daughter or I should be on watch
all night.  We were to share the duty at the early hours of the morning.
I was anxious about this, for I knew from our conversation that the
Detective would watch in secret himself, and would be particularly alert
about that time.

The day passed uneventfully.  Miss Trelawny slept in the afternoon; and
after dinner went to relieve the Nurse.  Mrs. Grant remained with her,
Sergeant Daw being on duty in the corridor.  Doctor Winchester and I
took our coffee in the library.  When we had lit our cigars he said
quietly:

""Now that we are alone I want to have a confidential talk.  We are
'tiled,' of course; for the present at all events?""

""Quite so!"" I said, my heart sinking as I thought of my conversation
with Sergeant Daw in the morning, and of the disturbing and harrowing
fears which it had left in my mind.  He went on:

""This case is enough to try the sanity of all of us concerned in it.
The more I think of it, the madder I seem to get; and the two lines,
each continually strengthened, seem to pull harder in opposite
directions.""

""What two lines?""  He looked at me keenly for a moment before replying.
Doctor Winchester's look at such moments was apt to be disconcerting.
It would have been so to me had I had a personal part, other than my
interest in Miss Trelawny, in the matter.  As it was, however, I stood
it unruffled.  I was now an attorney in the case; an amicus curiae in
one sense, in another retained for the defence.  The mere thought that
in this clever man's mind were two lines, equally strong and opposite,
was in itself so consoling as to neutralise my anxiety as to a new
attack.  As he began to speak, the Doctor's face wore an inscrutable
smile; this, however, gave place to a stern gravity as he proceeded:

""Two lines:  Fact and--Fancy!  In the first there is this whole thing;
attacks, attempts at robbery and murder; stupefyings; organised
catalepsy which points to either criminal hypnotism and thought
suggestion, or some simple form of poisoning unclassified yet in our
toxicology.  In the other there is some influence at work which is not
classified in any book that I know--outside the pages of romance.  I
never felt in my life so strongly the truth of Hamlet's words:

     'There are more things in Heaven and earth... 
      Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.'

""Let us take the 'Fact' side first.  Here we have a man in his home;
amidst his own household; plenty of servants of different classes in the
house, which forbids the possibility of an organised attempt made from
the servants"" hall.  He is wealthy, learned, clever.  From his
physiognomy there is no doubting that he is a man of iron will and
determined purpose.  His daughter--his only child, I take it, a young
girl bright and clever--is sleeping in the very next room to his.  There
is seemingly no possible reason for expecting any attack or disturbance
of any kind; and no reasonable opportunity for any outsider to effect
it.  And yet we have an attack made; a brutal and remorseless attack,
made in the middle of the night.  Discovery is made quickly; made with
that rapidity which in criminal cases generally is found to be not
accidental, but of premeditated intent.  The attacker, or attackers, are
manifestly disturbed before the completion of their work, whatever their
ultimate intent may have been.  And yet there is no possible sign of
their escape; no clue, no disturbance of anything; no open door or
window; no sound.  Nothing whatever to show who had done the deed, or
even that a deed has been done; except the victim, and his surroundings
incidental to the deed!

""The next night a similar attempt is made, though the house is full of
wakeful people; and though there are on watch in the room and around it
a detective officer, a trained nurse, an earnest friend, and the man's
own daughter.  The nurse is thrown into a catalepsy, and the watching
friend--though protected by a respirator--into a deep sleep.  Even the
detective is so far overcome with some phase of stupor that he fires off
his pistol in the sick-room, and can't even tell what he thought he was
firing at.  That respirator of yours is the only thing that seems to
have a bearing on the 'fact' side of the affair.  That you did not lose
your head as the others did--the effect in such case being in proportion
to the amount of time each remained in the room--points to the
probability that the stupefying medium was not hypnotic, whatever else
it may have been.  But again, there is a fact which is contradictory.
Miss Trelawny, who was in the room more than any of you--for she was in
and out all the time and did her share of permanent watching also--did
not seem to be affected at all.  This would show that the influence,
whatever it is, does not affect generally--unless, of course, it was that
she was in some way inured to it.  If it should turn out that it be some
strange exhalation from some of those Egyptian curios, that might
account for it; only, we are then face to face with the fact that Mr.
Trelawny, who was most of all in the room--who, in fact, lived more than
half his life in it--was affected worst of all.  What kind of influence
could it be which would account for all these different and
contradictory effects?  No! the more I think of this form of the
dilemma, the more I am bewildered!  Why, even if it were that the
attack, the physical attack, on Mr. Trelawny had been made by some one
residing in the house and not within the sphere of suspicion, the
oddness of the stupefyings would still remain a mystery.  It is not easy
to put anyone into a catalepsy.  Indeed, so far as is known yet in
science, there is no way to achieve such an object at will.  The crux of
the whole matter is Miss Trelawny, who seems to be subject to none of
the influences, or possibly of the variants of the same influence at
work.  Through all she goes unscathed, except for that one slight
semi-faint.  It is most strange!""

I listened with a sinking heart; for, though his manner was not
illuminative of distrust, his argument was disturbing.  Although it was
not so direct as the suspicion of the Detective, it seemed to single out
Miss Trelawny as different from all others concerned; and in a mystery
to be alone is to be suspected, ultimately if not immediately.  I
thought it better not to say anything.  In such a case silence is indeed
golden; and if I said nothing now I might have less to defend, or
explain, or take back later.  I was, therefore, secretly glad that his
form of putting his argument did not require any answer from me--for the
present, at all events. Doctor Winchester did not seem to expect any
answer--a fact which, when I recognised it, gave my pleasure, I hardly
knew why.  He paused for a while, sitting with his chin in his hand, his
eyes staring at vacancy, whilst his brows were fixed.  His cigar was
held limp between his fingers; he had apparently forgotten it.  In an
even voice, as though commencing exactly where he had left off, he
resumed his argument:

""The other horn of the dilemma is a different affair altogether; and if
we once enter on it we must leave everything in the shape of science and
experience behind us.  I confess that it has its fascinations for me;
though at every new thought I find myself romancing in a way that makes
me pull up suddenly and look facts resolutely in the face.  I sometimes
wonder whether the influence or emanation from the sick-room at times
affects me as it did the others--the Detective, for instance.  Of course
it may be that if it is anything chemical, any drug, for example, in
vaporeal form, its effects may be cumulative.  But then, what could
there be that could produce such an effect?  The room is, I know, full
of mummy smell; and no wonder, with so many relics from the tomb, let
alone the actual mummy of that animal which Silvio attacked.  By the
way, I am going to test him tomorrow; I have been on the trace of a
mummy cat, and am to get possession of it in the morning.  Wnen I bring
it here we shall find out if it be a fact that racial instinct can
survive a few thousand years in the grave.  However, to get back to the
subject in hand.  These very mummy smells arise from the presence of
substances, and combinations of substances, which the Egyptian priests,
who were the learned men and scientists of their time, found by the
experience of centuries to be strong enough to arrest the natural forces
of decay. There must be powerful agencies at work to effect such a
purpose; and it is possible that we may have here some rare substance or
combination whose qualities and powers are not understood in this later
and more prosaic age.  I wonder if Mr. Trelawny has any knowledge, or
even suspicion, of such a kind?  I only know this for certain, that a
worse atmosphere for a sick chamber could not possibly be imagined; and
I admire the courage of Sir James Frere in refusing to have anything to
do with a case under such conditions.  These instructions of Mr.
Trelawny to his daughter, and from what you have told me, the care with
which he has protected his wishes through his solicitor, show that he
suspected something, at any rate. Indeed, it would almost seem as if he
expected something to happen. . . .I wonder if it would be possible to
learn anything about that!  Surely his papers would show or suggest
something. . . .It is a difficult matter to tackle; but it might have to
be done.  His present condition cannot go on for ever; and if anything
should happen there would have to be an inquest.  In such case full
examination would have to be made into everything. . . .As it stands,
the police evidence would show a murderous attack more than once
repeated.  As no clue is apparent, it would be necessary to seek one in
a motive.""

He was silent.  The last words seemed to come in a lower and lower tone
as he went on.  It had the effect of hopelessness.  It came to me as a
conviction that now was my time to find out if he had any definite
suspicion; and as if in obedience to some command, I asked:

""Do you suspect anyone?""  He seemed in a way startled rather than
surprised as he turned his eyes on me:

""Suspect anyone?  Any thing, you mean.  I certainly suspect that there
is some influence; but at present my suspicion is held within such
limit.  Later on, if there be any sufficiently definite conclusion to my
reasoning, or my thinking-for there are not proper data for reasoning-I
may suspect; at present however-""

He stopped suddenly and looked at the door.  There was a faint sound as
the handle turned.  My own heart seemed to stand still.  There was over
me some grim, vague apprehension.  The interruption in the morning, when
I was talking with the Detective, came back upon me with a rush.

The door opened, and Miss Trelawny entered the room.

When she saw us, she started back; and a deep flush swept her face.  For
a few seconds she paused; at such a time a few succeeding seconds seem
to lengthen in geometrical progression.  The strain upon me, and, as I
could easily see, on the Doctor also, relaxed as she spoke:

""Oh, forgive me, I did not know that you were engaged.  I was looking
for you, Doctor Winchester, to ask you if I might go to bed tonight
with safety, as you will be here.  I feel so tired and worn-out that I
fear I may break down; and tonight I would certainly not be of any
use.""  Doctor Winchester answered heartily:

""Do!  Do go to bed by all means, and get a good night's sleep.  God
knows! you want it.  I am more than glad you have made the suggestion,
for I feared when I saw you tonight that I might have you on my hands a
patient next.""

She gave a sigh of relief, and the tired look seemed to melt from her
face.  Never shall I forget the deep, earnest look in her great,
beautiful black eyes as she said to me:

""You will guard Father tonight, won't you, with Doctor Winchester?  I
am so anxious about him that every second brings new fears.  But I am
really worn-out; and if I don't get a good sleep, I think I shall go
mad.  I will change my room for tonight. I'm afraid that if I stay so
close to Father's room I shall multiply every sound into a new terror.
But, of course, you will have m e waked if there be any cause.  I shall
be in the bedroom of the little suite next the boudoir off the hall.  I
had those rooms when first I came to live with Father, and I had no care
then. . . .It will be easier to rest there; and perhaps for a few hours
I may forget.  I shall be all right in the morning.  Good-night!""

When I had closed the door behind her and come back to the little table
at which we had been sitting, Doctor Winchester said:

""That poor girl is overwrought to a terrible degree.  I am delighted
that she is to get a rest.  It will be life to her; and in the morning
she will be all right.  Her nervous system is on the verge of a
breakdown.  Did you notice how fearfully disturbed she was, and how red
she got when she came in and found us talking?  An ordinary thing like
that, in her own house with her own guests, wouldn't under normal
circumstances disturb her!""

I was about to tell him, as an explanation in her defence, how her
entrance was a repetition of her finding the Detective and myself alone
together earlier in the day, when I remembered that that conversation
was so private that even an allusion to it might be awkward in evoking
curiosity.  So I remained silent.

We stood up to go to the sick-room; but as we took our way through the
dimly-lighted corridor I could not help thinking, again and again, and
again--ay, and for many a day after--how strange it was that she had
interrupted me on two such occasions when touching on such a theme.

There was certainly some strange web of accidents, in whose meshes we
were all involved.





Chapter VII
The Traveller's Loss

That night everything went well.  Knowing that Miss Trelawny herself was
not on guard, Doctor Winchester and I doubled our vigilance.  The Nurses
and Mrs. Grant kept watch, and the Detectives made their visit each
quarter of an hour.  All night the patient remained in his trance.  He
looked healthy, and his chest rose and fell with the easy breathing of a
child.  But he never stirred; only for his breathing he might have been
of marble.  Doctor Winchester and I wore our respirators, and irksome
they were on that intolerably hot night.  Between midnight and three
o'clock I felt anxious, and had once more that creepy feeling to which
these last few nights had accustome me; but the grey of the dawn,
stealing round the edges of the blinds, came with inexpressible relief,
followed by restfulness, went through the household.  During the hot
night my ears, strained to every sound, had been almost painfully
troubled; as though my brain or sensoriea were in anxious touch with
them.  Every breath of the Nurse or the rustle of her dress; every soft
pat of slippered feet, as the Policeman went his rounds; every moment of
watching life, seemed to be a new impetus to guardianship.  Something of
the same feeling must have been abroad in the house; now and again I
could hear upstairs the sound of restless feet, and more than once
downstairs the opening of a window.  With the coming of the dawn,
however, all this ceased, and the whole household seemed to rest.
Doctor Winchester went home when Sister Doris came to relieve Mrs.
Grant.  He was, I think, a little disappointed or chagrined that nothing
of an exceptional nature had happened during his long night vigil.

At eight o'clock Miss Trelawny joined us, and I was amazed as well as
delighted to see how much good her night's sleep had done her.  She was
fairly radiant; just as I had seen her at our first meeting and at the
picnic.  There was even a suggestion of colour in her cheeks, which,
however, looked startlingly white in contrast with her black brows and
scarlet lips.  With her restored strength, there seemed to have come a
tenderness even exceeding that which she had at first shown to her sick
father.  I could not but be moved by the loving touches as she fixed his
pillows and brushed the hair from his forehead.

I was wearied out myself with my long spell of watching; and now that
she was on guard I started off to be, blinking my tired eyes in the full
light and feeling the weariness of a sleepless night on me all at once.

I had a good sleep, and after lunch I was about to start out to walk to
Jermyn Street, when I noticed an importunate man at the hall door.  The
servant in charge was the one called Morris, formerly the ""odd man,"" but
since the exodus of the servants promoted to be butler pro tem.  The
stranger was speaking rather loudly, so that there was no difficulty in
understanding his grievance.  The servant man was respectful in both
words and demeanour; but he stood squarely in front of the great double
door, so that the other could not enter.  The first words which I heard
from the visitor sufficiently explained the situation:

""That's all very well, but I tell you I must see Mr. Trelawny!  What is
the use of your saying I can't, when I tell you I must.  You put me off,
and off, and off!  I came here at nine; you said then tha he was not up,
and that as he was not well he could not be disturbed.  I came at
twelve; and you told me again he was not up.  I asked then to see any of
his household; you told me that Miss Trelawny was not up.  Now I come
again at three, and you tell me he is still in bed, and is not awake
yet.  Where is Miss Trelawny?  'She is occupied and must not be
disturbed!'  Well, she must be disturbed!  Or some one must.  I am here
about Mr. Trelawny's special business; and I have come from a place
where servants always begin by saying No.  'No' isn't good enough for me
this time!  I've had three years of it, waiting outside doors and tents
when it took longer to get in than it did into the tombs; and then you
would think, too, the men inside were as dead as the mummies.  I've had
about enough of it, I tell you.  And when I come home, and find the door
of the man I've been working for barred, in just the same way and with
the same old answers, it stirs me up the wrong way.  Did Mr. Trelawny
leave orders that he would not see me when I should come?""

He paused and excitedly mopped his forehead.  The servant answered very
respectfully:

""I am very sorry, sir, if in doing my duty I have given any offence.
But I have my orders, and must obey them.  If you would like to leave
any message, I will give it to Miss Trelawny; and if you will leave your
address, she can communicate with you if she wishes.""  The answer came
in such a way that it was easy to see that the speaker was a kind-
hearted man, and a just one.

""My good fellow, I have no fault to find with you personally; and I am
sorry if I have hurt your feelings.  I must be just, even if I am angry.
But it is enough to anger any man to find himself in the position I am.
Time is pressing.  There is not an hour--not a minute--to lose!  And yet
here I am, kicking my heels for six hours; knowing all the time that
your master will be a hundred times angrier than I am, when he hears how
the time has been fooled away.  He would rather be waked out of a
thousand sleeps than not see me just at present-and before it is too
late.  My God! it's simply dreadful, after all I've gone through, to
have my work spoiled at the last and be foiled in the very doorway by a
stupid flunkey!  Is there no one with sense in the house; or with
authority, even if he hasn't got sense?  I could mighty soon convince
him that your master must be awakened; even if he sleeps like the Seven
Sleepers-""

There was no mistaking the man's sincerity, or the urgency and
importance of his business; from his point of view at any rate.  I
stepped forward.

""Morris,"" I said, ""you had better tell Miss Trelawny that this gentleman
wants to see her particularly.  If she is busy, ask Mrs. Grant to tell
her.""

""Very good, sir!"" he answered in a tone of relief, and hurried away.

I took the stranger into the little boudoir across the hall.  As we went
he asked me:

""Are you the secretary?""

""No!  I am a friend of Miss Trelawny's.  My name is Ross.""

""Thank you very much, Mr. Ross, for your kindness!"" he said.  ""My name
is Corbeck.  I would give you my card, but they don't use cards where
I've come from.  And if I had had any, I suppose they, too, would have
gone last night-""

He stopped suddenly, as though conscious that he had said too much.  We
both remained silent; as we waited I took stock of him.  A short, sturdy
man, brown as a coffee-berry; possibly inclined to be fat, but now lean
exceedingly.  The deep wrinkles in his face and neck were not merely
from time and exposure; there were those unmistakable signs where flesh
or fat has fallen away, and the skin has become loose.  The neck was
simply an intricate surface of seams and wrinkles, and sun-scarred with
the burning of the Desert.  The Far East, the Tropic Seasons, and the
Desert--each can have its colour mark.  But all three are quite
different; and an eye which has once known, can thenceforth easily
distinguish them.  The dusky pallor of one; the fierce red-brown of the
other; and of the third, the dark, ingrained burning, as though it had
become a permanent colour.  Mr. Corbeck had a big head, massive and
full; with shaggy, dark red-brown hair, but bald on the temples.  His
forehead was a fine one, high and broad; with, to use the terms of
physiognomy, the frontal sinus boldly marked.  The squareness of it
showed ""ratiocination""; and the fulness under the eyes ""language"".  He
had the short, broad nose that marks energy; the square chin-marked
despite a thick, unkempt beard-and massive jaw that showed great
resolution.

""No bad man for the Desert!"" I thought as I looked.

Miss Trelawny came very quickly.  When Mr. Corbeck saw her, he seemed
somewhat surprised.  But his annoyance and excitement had not
disappeared; quite enough remained to cover up any such secondary and
purely exoteric feeling as surprise. But as she spoke he never took his
eyes off her; and I made a mental note that I would find some early
opportunity of investigating the cause of his surprise.  She began with
an apology which quite smoothed down his ruffled feelings:

""Of course, had my Father been well you would not have been kept
waiting.  Indeed, had not I been on duty in the sick-room when you
called the first time, I should have seen you at once.  Now will you
kindly tell me what is the matter which so presses?"" He looked at me and
hesitated.  She spoke at once:

""You may say before Mr. Ross anything which you can tell me.  He has my
fullest confidence, and is helping me in my trouble.  I do not think you
quite understand how serious my Father's condition is.  For three days
he has not waked, or given any sign of consciousness; and I am in
terrible trouble about him.  Unhappily I am in great ignorance of my
Father and his life.  I only came to live with him a year ago; and I
know nothing whatever of his affairs.  I do not even know who you are,
or in what way your business is associated with him.""  She said this
with a little deprecating smile, all conventional and altogether
graceful; as though to express in the most genuine way her absurd
ignorance.

He looked steadily at her for perhaps a quarter of a minute; then he
spoke, beginning at once as though his mind were made up and his
confidence established:

""My name is Eugene Corbeck.  I am a Master of Arts and Doctor of Laws
and Master of Surgery of Cambridge; Doctor of Letters of Oxford; Doctor
of Science and Doctor of Languages of London University; Doctor of
Philosophy of Berlin; Doctor of Oriental Languages of Paris.  I have
some other degrees, honorary and otherwise, but I need not trouble you
with them.  Those I have name will show you that I am sufficiently
feathered with diplomas to fly into even a sick-room.  Early in life-
fortunately for my interests and pleasures, but unfortunately for my
pocket-I fell in with Egyptology.  I must have been bitten by some
powerful scarab, for I took it bad.  I went out tomb-hunting; and
managed to get a living of a sort, and to learn some things that you
can't get out of books.  I was in pretty low water when I met your
Father, who was doing some explorations on his own account; and since
then I haven't found that I have many unsatisfied wants.  He is a real
patron of the arts; no mad Egyptologist can ever hope for a better
chief!""

He spoke with feeling; and I was glad to see that Miss Trelawny coloured
up with pleasure at the praise of her father.  I could not help
noticing, however, that Mr. Corbeck was, in a measure, speaking as if
against time.  I took it that he wished, while speaking, to study his
ground; to see how far he would be justified in taking into confidence
the two strangers before him.  As he went on, I could see that his
confidence kept increasing.  When I thought of it afterward, and
remembered what he had said, I realised that the measure of the
information which he gave us marked his growing trust.

""i have been several times out on expeditions in Egypt for your Father;
and I have always found it a delight to work for him.  Many of his
treasures-and he has some rare ones, I tell you-he has procured through
me, either by my exploration or by purchase-or-or-otherwise.  Your
Father, Miss Trelawny, has a rare knowledge.  He sometimes makes up his
mind that he wants to find a particular thing, of whose existence-if it
still exists-he has become aware; and he will follow it all over the
world till he gets it.  I've been on just such a chase now.""

He stopped suddenly, as suddenly as thought his mouth had been shut by
the jerk of a string.  We waited; when he went on he spoke with a
caution that was new to him, as though he wished to forestall our asking
any questions:

""I am not at liberty to mentions anything of my mission; where it was
to, what it was for, or anything at all about it.  Such matters are in
confidence between Mr. Trelawny and myself; I am pledged to absolute
secrecy.""

He paused, and an embarrassed look crept over his face.  Suddenly he
said:

""You are sure, Miss Trelawny, your Father is not well enough to see me
today?""

A look of wonderment was on her face in turn.  But it cleared at once;--
she stood up, saying in a tone in which dignity and graciousness were
blended:

""Come and see for yourself!""  She moved toward her father's room; he
followed, and I brought up the rear.

Mr. Corbeck entered the sick-room as though he knew it.  There is an
unconscious attitude or bearing to persons in new surroundings which
there is no mistaking. Even in his anxiety to see his powerful friend,
he glanced for a moment round the room, as at a familiar place.  Then
all his attention became fixed on the bed.  I watched him narrowly, for
somehow I felt that on this man depended much of our enlightenment
regarding the strange matter in which we were involved.

It was not that I doubted him.  The man was of transparent honesty; it
was this very quality which we had to dread.  He was of that courageous,
fixed trueness to his undertaking, that if he should deem it his duty to
guard a secret he would do it to the last.  The case before us was, at
least, an unusual one; and it would, consequently, require more liberal
recognition of bounds of the duty of secrecy than would hold under
ordinary conditions.  To us, ignorance was helplessness.  If we could
learn anything of the past we might at least form some idea of the
conditions antecedent to the attack; and might, so, achieve some means
of helping the patient to recovery. There were curios whish might be
removed. . . .My thoughts were beginning to whirl once again; I pulled
myself up sharply and watched.  There was a look of infinite pity on the
sun-stained, rugged face as he gazed at his friend, lying so helpless.
The sternness of Mr. Trelawny's face had not relaxed in sleep; but
somehow it made the helplessness more marked.  It would not have
troubled one to see a weak or an ordinary face under such conditions;
but this purposeful, masterful man, lying before us wrapped in
impenetrable sleep, had all the pathos of a great ruin.  The sight was
not a new one to us; but I could see that Miss Trelawny, like myself,
was moved afresh by it in the presence of the stranger.  Mr. Corbeck's
face grew stern.  All the pity died away; and in its stead came a grim,
hard look which boded ill for whoever had been the cause of this mighty
downfall.  This look in turn gave place to one of decision; the volcanic
energy of the man was working to some definite purpose.  He glanced
around at us; and as his eyes lighted on Nurse Kennedy his eyebrows went
up a trifle.  She noted the look, and glanced interrogatively at Miss
Trelawny, who flashed back a reply with a glance.  She went quietly from
the room, closing the door behind her.  Mr. Corbeck looked first at me,
with a strong man's natural impulse to learn from a man rather than a
woman; then at Miss Trelawny, with a remembrance of the duty of
courtesy, and said:

""Tell me all about it.  How it began and when!""  Miss Trelawny looked at
me appeallingly; and forthwith I told him all that I knew.  He seemed to
make no motion during the whole time; but insensibly the bronze face
became steel.  When, at the end, I told him of Mr. Marvin's visit and of
the Power of Attorney, his look began to brighten.  And when, seeing his
interest in the matter, I went more into detail as to its terms, he
spoke:

""Good!  Now I know where my duty lies!""

With a sinking heart I heard him.  Such a phrase, coming at such a time,
seemed to close the door to my hopes of enlightenment.

""What do you mean?"" I asked, feeling that my question was a feeble one.

His answer emphasized my fears:

""Trelawny knows what he is doing.  He had some definite purpose in all
that he did; and we must not thwart him.  He evidently expected
something to happen, and guarded himself at all points.""

""Not at all points!"" I said impulsively.  ""There must have been a weak
spot somewhere, or he wouldn't be lying here like that!""  Somehow his
impassiveness surprised me.  I had expected that he would find a valid
argument in my phrase; but it did not move him, at least not in the way
I thought.  Something like a smile flickered over his swarthy face as he
answered me:

""This is not the end!  Trelawny did not guard himself to no purpose.
Doubtless, he expected this too; or at any rate the possibility of it.""

""Do you know what he expected, or from what source?""  The questioner was
Miss Trelawny.

The answer came at once:  ""No!  I know nothing of either.  I can 
guess. . .""  He stopped suddenly.

""Guess what?""  The suppressed excitement in the girl's voice was akin to
anguish. The steely look came over the swarthy face again; but there was
tenderness and courtesy in both voice and manner as he replied:

""Believe me, I would do anything I honestly could to relieve you
anxiety.  But in this I have a higher duty.""

""What duty?""

""Silence!""  As he spoke the word, the strong mouth closed like a steel
trap.

We all remained silent for a few minutes.  In the intensity of our
thinking, the silence became a positive thing; the small sounds of life
within and without the house seemed intrusive.  The first to break it
was Miss Trelawny.  I had seen an idea-a hope-flash in her eyes; but she
steadied herself before speaking:

""What was the urgent subject on which you wanted to see me, knowing that
my Father was-not available?""  The pause showed her mastery of her
thoughts.

The instantaneous change in Mr. Corbeck was almost ludicrous.  His start
of surprise, coming close upon his iron-clad impassiveness, was like a
pantomimic change.  But all idea of comedy was swept away by the tragic
earnestness with which he remembered his original purpose.

""My God!"" he said, as he raised his hand from the chair back on which it
rested, and beat it down with a violence which would in itself have
arrested attention.  His brows corrugated as he went on:  ""I quite
forgot!  What a loss!  Now of all times!  Just at the moment of success!
He lying there helpless, and my tongue tied!  Not able to raise hand or
foot in my ignorance of his wishes!""

""What is it?  Oh, do tell us!  I am so anxious about my dear Father!  Is
it any new trouble?  I hope not! oh, I hope not!  I have had such
anxiety and trouble already!  It alarms me afresh to hear you speak so!
Won't you tell me something to allay this terrible anxiety and
uncertainty?""

He drew his sturdy form up to his full height as he said:

""Alas!  I cannot, may not, tell you anything.  It is his secret.""  He
pointed to the bed. ""And yet-and yet I came here for his advice, his
counsel, his assistance.  And he lies there helpless. . . .And time is
flying by us!  It may soon be too late!""

""What is it? what is it?"" broke in Miss Trelawny in a sort of passion of
anxiety, her face drawn with pain.  ""Oh, speak!  Say something!  This
anxiety, and horror, and mystery are killing me!""  Mr. Corbeck calmed
himself by a great effort.

""I may not tell you details; but I have had a great loss.  My mission,
in which I have spent three years, was successful.  I discovered all
that I sought-and more; and brought them home with me safely.
Treasures, priceless in themselves, but doubly precious to him by whose
wishes and instructions I sought them.  I arrived in London only last
night, and when I woke this morning my precious charge was stolen.
Stolen in some mysterious way.  Not a soul in London knew that I was
arriving.  No one but myself knew what was in the shabby portmanteau
that I carried.  My room had but one door, and that I locked and bolted.
The room was high in the house, five stories up, so that no entrance
could have been obtained by the window.  Indeed, I had closed the window
myself and shut the hasp, for I wished to be secure in every way.  This
morning the hasp was untouched. . . .And yet my portmanteau was empty.
The lamps were gone! . . .There! it is out.  I went to Egypt to search
for a set of antique lamps which Mr. Trelawny wished to trace.  With
incredible labour, and through many dangers, I followed them.  I brought
them safe home. . . .And now!""  He turned away much moved.  Even his
iron nature was breaking down under the sense of loss.

Miss Trelawny stepped over and laid her hand on his arm.  I looked at
her in amazement.  All the passion and pain which had so moved her
seemed to have taken the form of resolution.  Her form was erect, her
eyes blazed; energy was manifest in every nerve and fibre of her being.
Even her voice was full of nervous power as she spoke.  It was apparent
that she was a marvellously strong woman, and that her strength could
answer when called upon.

""We must act at once!  My Father's wishes must be carried out if it is
possible to us. Mr. Ross, you are a lawyer.  We have actually in the
house a man whom you consider one of the best detectives in London.
Surely we can do something.  We can begin at once!""  Mr. Corbeck took
new life from her enthusiasm.

""Good!  You are your Father's daughter!"" was all he said.  But his
admiration for her energy was manifested by the impulsive way in which
he took her hand.  I moved over to the door.  I was going to bring
Sergeant Daw; and from her look of approval, I knew that Margaret-Miss
Trelawny-understood.  I was at the door when Mr. Corbeck called me back.

""One moment,"" he said, ""before we bring a stranger on the scene.  It
must be borne in mind that he is not to know what you know now, that the
lamps were the objects of a prolonged and difficult and dangerous
search.  All I can tell him, all that he must know from any source, is
that some of my property has been stolen.  I must describe some of the
lamps, especially one, for it is of gold; and my fear is lest the thief,
ignorant of its historic worth, may, in order to cover up his crime,
have it melted.  I would willingly pay ten, twenty, a hundred, a
thousand times its intrinsic value rather than have it destroyed.  I
shall tell him only what is necessary.  So, please, let me answer any
questions he may ask; unless, of course, I ask you or refer to either of
you for the answer.""  We both nodded acquiescence.  Then a thought
struck me and I said:

""By the way, if it be necessary to keep this matter quiet it will be
better to have it if possible a private job for the Detective.  If once
a thing gets to Scotland Yard it is out of our power to keep it quiet,
and further secrecy may be impossible.  I shall sound Sergeant Daw
before he comes up.  If I say nothing, it will mean that he accepts the
task and will deal with it privately.""  Mr. Corbeck answered at once:

""Secrecy is everything.  The one thing I dread is that the lamps, or
some of them, may be destroyed at once.""  To my intense astonishment
Miss Trelawny spoke out at once, but quietly, in a decided voice:

""They will not be destroyed; nor any of them!""  Mr. Corbeck actually
smiled in amazement.

""How on earth do you know?"" he asked.  Her answer was still more
incomprehensible:

""I don't know how I know it; but know it I do.  I feel it all through
me; as though it were a conviction which has been with me all my life!""





Chapter VIII
The Finding of the Lamps

Sergeant Daw at first made some demur; but finally agreed to advise
privately on a matter which might be suggested to him.  He added that I
was to remember that he only undertook to advise; for if action were
required he might have to refer the matter to headquarters.  With this
understanding I left him in the study, and brought Miss Trelawny and Mr.
Corbeck to him.  Nurse Kennedy resumed her place at the bedside before
we left the room.

I could not but admire the cautious, cool-headed precision with which
the traveller stated his case.  He did not seem to conceal anything, and
yet he gave the least possible description of the objects missing.  He
did not enlarge on the mystery of the case; he seemed to look on it as
an ordinary hotel theft.  Knowing, as I did, that his one object was to
recover the articles before their identity could be obliterated, I could
see the rare intellectual skill with which he gave the necessary matter
and held back all else, though without seeming to do so.  ""Truly,""
thought I, ""this man has learned the lesson of the Eastern bazaars; and
with Western intellect has improved upon his masters!""  He quite
conveyed his idea to the Detective, who, after thinking the matter over
for a few moments, said:

""Pot or scale? that is the question.""

""What does that mean?"" asked the other, keenly alert.

""An old thieves phrase from Birmingham.  I thought that in these days of
slang everyone knew that.  In old times at Brum, which had a lot of
small metal industries, the gold- and silver-smiths used to buy metal
from almost anyone who came along. And as metal in small quantities
could generally be had cheap when they didn't ask where it came from, it
got to be a custom to ask only one thing-whether the customer wanted the
goods melted, in which case the buyer made the price, and the melting-
pot was always on the fire.  If it was to be preserved in its present
state at the buyer's option, it went into the scale and fetched standard
price for old metal.

""There is a good deal of such work done still, and in other places than
Brum.  When we're looking for stolen watches we often come across the
works, and it's not possible to identify wheels and springs out of a
heap; but it's not often that we come across cases that are wanted.
Now, in the present instance much will depend on whether the thief is a
good man-that's what they call a man who knows his work.  A first-class
crook will know whether a thing is of more value than merely the metal
in it; and in such case he would put it with someone who could place it
later on-in America or France, perhaps.  By the way, do you think anyone
but yourself could identify your lamps?""

""No one but myself!""

""Are there others like them?""

""Not that I know of,"" answered Mr. Corbeck; ""though there may be others
that resemble them in many particulars.""  The Detective paused before
asking again: ""Would any other skilled person-at the British Museum, for
instance, or a dealer, or a collector like Mr. Trelawny, know the value-
the artistic value-of the lamps?""

""Certainly!  Anyone with a head on his houlders would see at a glance
that the things were valuable.""

The Detective's face brightened.  ""Then there is a chance.  If your door
was locked and the window shut, the goods were not stolen by the chance
of a chambermaid or a boots coming along.  Whoever did the job went
after it special; and he ain't going to part with his swag without his
price.  This must be a case of notice to the pawnbrokers.  There's one
good thing about it, anyhow, that the hue and cry needn't be given.  We
needn't tell Scotland Yard unless you like; we can work the thing
privately.  If you wish to keep the thing dark, as you told me at the
first, that is our chance.""  Mr. Corbeck, after a pause, said quietly:

""I suppose you couldn't hazard a suggestion as to how the robbery was
effected?"" The Policeman smiled the smile of knowledge and experience.

""In a very simple way, I have no doubt, sir.  That is how all these
mysterious crimes turn out in the long-run.  The criminal knows his work
and all the tricks of it; and he is always on the watch for chances.
Moreover, he knows by experience what these chances are likely to be,
and how they usually come.  The other person is only careful; he doesn't
know all the tricks and pits that may be made for him, and by some
little oversight or other he falls into the trap.  When we know all
about this case, you will wonder that you did not see the method of it
all along!""  This seemed to annoy Mr. Corbeck a little; there was
decided heat in his manner as he answered:

""Look here, my good friend, there is not anything simple about this
case-except that the things were taken.  The window was closed; the
fireplace was bricked up.  There is only one door to the room, and that
I locked and bolted.  There is no transom; I have heard all about hotel
robberies through the transom.  I never left my room in the night.  I
looked at the things before going to bed; and I went to look at them
again when I woke up.  If you can rig up any kind of simple robbery out
of these facts you are a clever man.  That's all I say; clever enough to
go right away and get my things back.""  Miss Trelawny laid her hand upon
his arm in a soothing way, and said quietly:

""Do not distress yourself unnecessarily.  I am sure they will turn up.""
Sergeant Daw turned to her so quickly that I could not help remembering
vividly his suspicions of her, already formed, as he said:

""May I ask, miss, on what you base that opinion?""

I dreaded to hear her answer, given to ears already awake to supicion;
but it came to me as a new pain or shock all the same:

""I cannot tell you how I know.  But I am sure of it!""  The Detective
looked at her for some seconds in silence, and then threw a quick glance
at me.

Presently he had a little more conversation with Mr. Corbeck as to his
own movements, the details of the hotel and the room, and the means of
identifying the goods.  Then he went away to commence his inquiries, Mr.
Corbeck impressing on him the necessity for secrecy lest the thief
should get wind of his danger and destroy the lamps.  Mr. Corbeck
promised, when going away to attend to various matters of his own
business, to return early in the evening, and to stay in the house.

All that day Miss Trelawny was in better spirits and looked in better
strength than she had yet been, despite the new shock and annoyance of
the theft which must ultimately bring so much disappointment to her
father.

We spent most of the day looking over the curio treasures of Mr.
Trelawny.  From what I had heard from Mr. Corbeck I began to have some
idea of the vastness of his enterprise in the world of Egyptian
research; and with this light everything around me began to have a new
interest.  As I went on, the interest grew; any lingering doubts which I
might have had changed to wonder and admiration.  The house seemed to be
a veritable storehouse of marvels of antique art.  In addition to the
curios, big and little, in Mr. Trelawny's own room-from the great
sarcophagi down to the scarabs of all kinds in the cabinets-the great
hall, the staircase landings, the study, and even the boudoir were full
of antique pieces which would have made a collector's mouth water.

Miss Trelawny from the first came with me, and looked with growing
interest at everything.  After having examined some cabinets of
exquisite amulets she said to me in quite a naive way:

""You will hardly believe that I have of late seldom even looked at any
of these things. It is only since Father has been ill that I seem to
have even any curiosity about them. But now, they grow and grow on me to
quite an absorbing degree.  I wonder if it is that the collector's blood
which I have in my veins is beginning to manifest itself.  If so, the
strange thing is that I have not felt the call of it before.  Of course
I know most of the big things, and have examined them more or less; but
really, in a sort of way I have always taken them for granted, as though
they had always been there.  I have noticed the same thing now and again
with family pictures, and the way they are taken for granted by the
family.  If you will let me examine them with you it will be
delightful!""

It was a joy to me to hear her talk in such a way; and her last
suggestion quite thrilled me.  Together we went round the various rooms
and passages, examining and admiring the magnificent curios.  There was
such a bewildering amount and variety of objects that we could only
glance at most of them; but as we went along we arranged that we should
take them seriatim, day by day, and examine them more closely.  In the
hall was a sort of big frame of floriated steel work which Margaret said
her father used for lifting the heavy stone lids of the sarcophagi.  It
was not heavy and could be moved about easily enough.  By aid of this we
raised the covers in turn and looked at the endless series of
hieroglyphic pictures cut in most of them.  In spite of her profession
of ignorance Margaret knew a good deal about them; her year of life with
her father had had unconsciously its daily and hourly lesson.  She was a
remarkably clever and acute-minded girl, and with a prodigious memory;
so that her store of knowledge, gathered unthinkingly bit by bit, had
grown to proportions that many a scholar might have envied.

And yet it was all so naive and unconscious; so girlish and simple.  She
was so fresh in her views and ideas, and had so little thought of self,
that in her companionship I forgot for the time all the troubles and
mysteries which enmeshed the house; and I felt like a boy again. . . .

The most interesting of the sarcophagi were undoubtedly the three in Mr.
Trelawny's room.  Of these, two were of dark stone, one of porphyry and
the other of a sort of ironstone.  These were wrought with some
hieroglyphs.  But the third was strikingly different.  It was of some
yellow-brown substance of the dominating colour effect of Mexican onyx,
which it resembled in many ways, excepting that the natural pattern of
its convolutions was less marked.  Here and there were patches almost
transparent-certainly translucent.  The whole chest, cover and all, was
wrought with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of minute hieroglyphics,
seemingly in an endless series.  Back, front, sides, edges, bottom, all
had their quota of the dainty pictures, the deep blue of their colouring
showing up fresh and sharply edge in the yellow stone.  It was very
long, nearly nine feet; and perhaps a yard wide.  The sides undulated,
so that there was no hard line.  Even the corners took such excellent
curves that they pleased the eye.  ""Truly,"" I said, ""this must have been
made for a giant!""

""Or for a giantess!"" said Margaret.

This sarcophagus stood near to one of the windows.  It was in one
respect different from all the other sarcophagi in the place.  All the
others in the house, of whatever material-granite, porphyry, ironstone,
basalt, slate, or wood-were quite simple in form within.  Some of them
were plain of interior surface; others were engraved, in whole or part,
with hieroglyphics.  But each and all of them had no protuberances or
uneven surface anywhere.  They might have been used for baths; indeed,
they resembled in many ways Roman baths of stone or marble which I had
seen.  Inside this, however, was a raised space, outlined like a human
figure.  I asked Margaret if she could explain it in any way.  For
answer she said:

""Father never wished to speak about this.  It attracted my attention
from the first; but when I asked him about it he said:  'I shall tell
you all about it some day, little girl-if I live!  But not yet!  The
story is not yet told, as I hope to tell it to you!  Some day, perhaps
soon, I shall know all; and then we shall go over it together.  And a
mighty interesting story you will find it-from first to last!'  Once
afterward I said, rather lightly I am afraid:  'Is that story of the
sarcophagus told yet, Father?'  He shook his head, and looked at me
gravely as he said:  'Not yet, little girl; but it will be-if I live-if
I live!'  His repeating that phrase about his living rather frightened
me; I never ventured to ask him again.""

Somehow this thrilled me.  I could not exactly say how or why; but it
seemed like a gleam of light at last.  There are, I think, moments when
the mind accepts something as true; though it can account for neither
the course of the thought, nor, if there be more than one thought, the
connection between them.  Hitherto we had been in such outer darkness
regarding Mr. Trelawny, and the strange visitation which had fallen on
him, that anything which afforded a clue, even of the faintest and most
shadowy kind, had at the outset the enlightening satisfaction of a
certainty.  Here were two lights of our puzzle.  The first that Mr.
Trelawny associated with this particular curio a doubt of his own
living.  The second that he had some purpose or expectation with regard
to it, which he would not disclose, even to his daughter, till complete.
Again it was to be borne in mind that this sarcophagus differed
internally from all the others.  What meant that odd raised place?  I
said nothing to Miss Trelawny, for I feared lest I should either
frighten her or buoy her up with future hopes; but I made up my mind
that I would take an early opportunity for further investigation.

Close beside the sarcophagus was a low table of green stone with red
veins in it, like bloodstone.  The feet were fashioned like the paws of
a jackal, and round each leg was twined a full-throated snake wrought
exquisitely in pure gold.  On it rested a strange and very beautiful
coffer or casket of stone of a peculiar shape.  It was something like a
small coffin, except that the longer sides, instead of being cut off
square like the upper or level part were continued to a point.  Thus it
was an irregular septahedron, there being two planes on each of the two
sides, one end and a top and bottom.  The stone, of one piece of which
it was wrought, was such as I had never seen before.  At the base it was
of a full green, the colour of emerald without, of course, its gleam.
It was not by any means dull, however, either in colour or substance,
and was of infinite hardness and fineness of texture.  The surface was
almost that of a jewel.  The colour grew lighter as it rose, with
gradation so fine as to be imperceptible, changing to a fine yellow
almost of the colour of ""mandarin"" china.  It was quite unlike anything
I had ever seen, and did not resemble any stone or gem that I knew.  I
took it to be some unique mother-stone, or matrix of some gem.  It was
wrought all over, except in a few spots, with fine hieroglyphics,
exquisitely done and coloured with the same blue-green cement or pigment
that appeared on the sarcophagus.  In length it was about two feet and a
half; in breadth about half this, and was nearly a foot high.  The
vacant spaces were irregularly distributed about the top running to the
pointed end.  These places seemed less opaque than the rest of the
stone.  I tried to lift up the lid so that I might see if they were
translucent; but it was securely fixed.  It fitted so exactly that the
whole coffer seemed like a single piece of stone mysteriously hollowed
from within.  On the sides and edges were some odd-looking protuberances
wrought just as finely as any other portion of the coffer which had been
sculptured by manifest design in the cutting of the stone.  They had
queer-shaped holes or hollows, different in each; and, like the rest,
were covered with the hieroglyphic figures, cut finely and filled in
with the same blue-green cement.

On the other side of the great sarcophagus stood another small table of
alabaster, exquisitely chased with symbolic figures of gods and the
signs of the zodiac.  On this table stood a case of about a foot square
composed of slabs of rock crystal set in a skeleton of bands of red
gold, beautifully engraved with hieroglyphics, and coloured with a blue
green, very much the tint of the figures on the sarcophagus and the
coffer.  The whole work was quite modern.

But if the case was modern what it held was not.  Within, on a cushion
of cloth of gold as fine as silk, and with the peculiar softness of old
gold, rested a mummy hand, so perfect that it startled one to see it.  A
woman's hand, fine and long, with slim tapering fingers and nearly as
perfect as when it was given to the embalmer thousands of years before.
In the embalming it had lost nothing of its beautiful shape; even the
wrist seemed to maintain its pliability as the gentle curve lay on the
cushion.  The skin was of a rich creamy or old ivory colour; a dusky
fair skin which suggested heat, but heat in shadow.  The great
peculiarity of it, as a hand, was that it had in all seven fingers,
there being two middle and two index fingers.  The upper end of the
wrist was jagged, as though it had been broken off, and was stained with
a red-brown stain.  On the cushion near the hand was a small scarab,
exquisitely wrought of emerald.

""That is another of Father's mysteries.  When I asked him about it he
said that it was perhaps the most valuable thing he had, except one.
When I asked him what that one was, he refused to tell me, and forbade
me to ask him anything concerning it. 'I will tell you,' he said, 'all
about it, too, in good time-if I live!'""

""If I live!"" the phrase again.  These three things grouped together, the
Sarcophagus, the Coffer, and the Hand, seemed to make a trilogy of
mystery indeed!

At this time Miss Trelawny was sent for on some domestic matter.  I
looked at the other curios in the room; but they did not seem to have
anything like the same charm for me, now that she was away.  Later on in
the day I was sent for to the boudoir where she was consulting with Mrs.
Grant as to the lodgment of Mr. Corbeck.  They were in doubt as to
whether he should have a room close to Mr. Trelawny's or quite away from
it, and had thought it well to ask my advice on the subject.  I came to
the conclusion that he had better not be too near; for the first at all
events, he could easily be moved closer if necessary.  When Mrs. Grant
had gone, I asked Miss Trelawny how it came that the furniture of this
room, the boudoir in which we were, was so different from the other
rooms of the house.

""Father's forethought!"" she answered.  ""When I first came, he thought,
and rightly enough, that I might get frightened with so many records of
death and the tomb everywhere.  So he had this room and the little suite
off it-that door opens into the sitting-room-where I slept last night,
furnished with pretty things.  You see, they are all beautiful.  That
cabinet belonged to the great Napoleon.""

""There is nothing Egyptian in these rooms at all then?"" I asked, rather
to show interest in what she had said than anything else, for the
furnishing of the room was apparent.  ""What a lovely cabinet!  May I
look at it?""

""Of course! with the greatest pleasure!"" she answered, with a smile.
""Its finishing, within and without, Father says, is absolutely
complete.""  I stepped over and looked at it closely.  It was made of
tulip wood, inlaid in patterns; and was mounted in ormolu.  I pulled
open one of the drawers, a deep one where I could see the work to great
advantage.  As I pulled it, something rattled inside as though rolling;
there was a tinkle as of metal on metal.

""Hullo!"" I said.  ""There is something in here.  Perhaps I had better not
open it.""

""There is nothing that I know of,"" she answered.  ""Some of the
housemaids may have used it to put something by for the time and
forgotten it.  Open it by all means!""

I pulled open the drawer; as I did so, both Miss Trelawny and I started
back in amazement.

There before our eyes lay a number of ancient Egyptian lamps, of various
sizes and of strangely varied shapes.

We leaned over them and looked closely.  My own heart was beating like a
trip-hammer; and I could see by the heaving of Margaret's bosom that
she was strangely excited.

Whilst we looked, afraid to touch and almost afraid to think, there was
a ring at the front door; immediately afterwards Mr. Corbeck, followed
by Sergeant Daw, came into the hall.  The door of the boudoir was open,
and when they saw us Mr. Corbeck came running in, followed more slowly
by the Detective.  There was a sort of chastened joy in his face and
manner as he said impulsively:

""Rejoice with me, my dear Miss Trelawny, my luggage has come and all my
things are intact!""  Then his face fell as he added, ""Except the lamps.
The lamps that were worth all the rest a thousand times. . . .""  He
stopped, struck by the strange pallor of her face.  Then his eyes,
following her look and mine, lit on the cluster of lamps in the drawer.
He gave a sort of cry of surprise and joy as he bent over and touched
them:

""My lamps!  My lamps!  Then they are safe-safe-safe! . . . But how, in
the name of God-of all the Gods-did they come here?""

We all stood silent.  The Detective made a deep sound of in-taking
breath.  I looked at him, and as he caught my glance he turned his eyes
on Miss Trelawny whose back was toward him.

There was in them the same look of suspicion which had been there when
he had spoken to me of her being the first to find her father on the
occasions of the attacks.





Chapter IX
The Need of Knowledge

Mr. Corbeck seemed to go almost off his head at the recovery of the
lamps.  He took them up one by one and looked them all over tenderly, as
though they were things that he loved.  In his delight and excitement he
breathed so hard that it seemed almost like a cat purring.  Sergeant Daw
said quietly, his voice breaking the silence like a discord in a melody:

""Are you quite sure those lamps are the ones you had, and that were
stolen?""

His answer was in an indignant tone:  ""Sure!  Of course I'm sure.  There
isn't another set of lamps like these in the world!""

""So far as you know!""  The Detective's words were smooth enough, but his
manner was so exasperating that I was sure he had some motive in it; so
I waited in silence. He went on:

""Of course there may be some in the British Museum; or Mr. Trelawny may
have had these already.  There's nothing new under the sun, you know,
Mr. Corbeck; not even in Egypt.  These may be the originals, and yours
may have been the copies.  Are there any points by which you can
identify these as yours?""

Mr. Corbeck was really angry by this time.  He forgot his reserve; and
in his indignation poured forth a torrent of almost incoherent, but
enlightening, broken sentences:

""Identify!  Copies of them!  British Museum!  Rot!  Perhaps they keep a
set in Scotland Yard for teaching idiot policemen Egyptology!  Do I know
them?  When I have carried them about my body, in the desert, for three
months; and lay awake night after night to watch them!  When I have
looked them over with a magnifying-glass, hour after hour, till my eyes
ached; till every tiny blotch, and chip, and dinge became as familiar to
me as his chart to a captain; as familiar as they doubtless have been
all the time to every thick-headed area-prowler within the bounds of
mortality.  See here, young man, look at these!""  He ranged the lamps in
a row on the top of the cabinet.  ""Did you ever see a set of lamps of
these shapes-of any one of these shapes?  Look at these dominant figures
on them!  Did you ever see so complete a set-even in Scotland Yard; even
in Bow Street?  Look! one on each, the seven forms of Hathor. Look at
that figure of the Ka of a Princess of the Two Egypts, standing between
Ra and Osiris in the Boat of the Dead, with the Eye of Sleep, supported
on legs, bending before her; and Harmochis rising in the north.  Will
you find that in the British Museum-or Bow Street?  Or perhaps your
studies in the Gizeh Museum, or the Fitzwilliam, or Paris, or Leyden, or
Berlin, have shown you that the episode is common in hieroglyphics; and
that this is only a copy.  Perhaps you can tell me what that figure of
Ptah-Seker-Ausar holding the Tet wrapped in the Sceptre of Papyrus
means?  Did you ever see it before; even in the British Museum, or
Gizeh, or Scotland Yard?""

He broke off suddenly; and then went on in quite a different way:

""Look here! it seems to me that the thick-headed idiot is myself!  I beg
your pardon, old fellow, for my rudeness.  I quite lost my temper at the
suggestion that I do not know these lamps.  You don't mind, do you?""
The Detective answered heartily:

""Lord, sir, not I.  I like to see folks angry when I am dealing with
them, whether they are on my side or the other.  It is when people are
angry that you learn the truth from them.  I keep cool; that is my
trade!  Do you know, you have told me more about those lamps in the past
two minutes than when you filled me up with details of how to identify
them.""

Mr. Corbeck grunted; he was not pleased at having given himself away.
All at once he turned to  me and said in his natural way:

""Now tell me how you got them back?""  I was so surprised that I said
without thinking:

""We didn't get them back!""  The traveller laughed openly.

""What on earth do you mean?"" he asked.  ""You didn't get them back!  Why,
there they are before your eyes!  We found you looking at them when we
came in.""  By this time I had recovered my surprise and had my wits
about me.

""Why, that's just it,"" I said.  ""We had only come across them, by
accident, that very moment!""

Mr. Corbeck drew back and looked hard at Miss Trelawny and myself;
turning his eyes from one to the other as he asked:

""Do you mean to tell me that no one brought them here; that you found
them in that drawer?  That, so to speak, no one at all brought them
back?""

""I suppose someone must have brought them here; they couldn't have come
of their own accord.  But who it was, or when, or how, neither of us
knows.  We shall have to make inquiry, and see if any of the servants
know anything of it.""

We all stood silent for several seconds.  It seemed a long time.  The
first to speak was the Detective, who said in an unconscious way:

""Well, I'm damned!  I beg your pardon, miss!""  Then his mouth shut like
a steel trap.

We called up the servants, one by one, and asked them if they knew
anything of some articles placed in a drawer in the boudoir; but none of
them could throw any light on the circumstance.  We did not tell them
what the articles were; or let them see them.

Mr. Corbeck packed the lamps in cotton wool, and placed them in a tin
box.  This, I may mention incidentally, was then brought up to the
detectives' room, where one of the men stood guard over them with a
revolver the whole night.  Next day we got a small safe into the house,
and placed them in it.  There were two different keys.  One of them I
kept myself; the other I placed in my drawer in the Safe Deposit vault.
We were all determined that the lamps should not be lost again.

About an hour after we had found the lamps, Doctor Winchester arrived.
He had a large parcel with him, which, when unwrapped, proved to be the
mummy of a cat. With Miss Trelawny's permission he placed this in the
boudoir; and Silvio was brought close to it.  To the surprise of us all,
however, except perhaps Doctor Winchester, he did not manifest the least
annoyance; he took no notice of it whatever.  He stood on the table
close beside it, purring loudly.  Then, following out his plan, the
Doctor brought him into Mr. Trelawny's room, we all following. Doctor
Winchester was excited; Miss Trelawny anxious.  I was more than
interested myself, for I began to have a glimmering of the Doctor's
idea.  The Detective was calmly and coldly superior; but Mr. Corbeck,
who was an enthusiast, was full of eager curiosity.

The moment Doctor Winchester got into the room, Silvio began to mew and
wriggle; and jumping out of his arms, ran over to the cat mummy and
began to scratch angrily at it.  Miss Trelawny had some difficulty in
taking him away; but so soon as he was out of the room he became quiet.
When she came back there was a clamour of comments:

""I thought so!"" from the Doctor.

""What can it mean?"" from Miss Trelawny.

""That's a very strange thing!"" from Mr. Corbeck.

""Odd! but it doesn't prove anything!"" from the Detective.

""I suspend my judgment!"" from myself, thinking it advisable to say
something.

Then by common consent we dropped the theme--for the present.

In my room that evening I was making some notes of what had happened,
when there came a low tap on the door.  In obedience to my summons
Sergeant Daw came in, carefully closing the door behind him.

""Well, Sergeant,"" said I, 'sit down.  What is it?""

""I wanted to speak to you, sir, about those lamps.""  I nodded and
waited:  he went on:  ""You know that that room where they were found
opens directly into the room where Miss Trelawny slept last night?""

""Yes.""

""During the night a window somewhere in that part of the house was
opened, and shut again.  I heard it, and took a look round; but I could
see no sign of anything.""

""Yes, I know that!"" I said; ""I heard a window moved myself.""

""Does nothing strike you as strange about it, sir?""

""Strange!"" I said; ""Strange! why it's all the most bewildering,
maddening thing I have ever encountered.  It is all so strange that one
seems to wonder, and simply waits for what will happen next.  But what
do you mean by strange?""

The Detective paused, as if choosing his words to begin; and then said
deliberately:

""You see, I am not one who believes in magic and such things.  I am for
facts all the time; and I always find in the long-run that there is a
reason and a cause for everything.  This new gentleman says these things
were stolen out of his room in the hotel.  The lamps, I take it from
some things he has said, really belong to Mr. Trelawny.  His daughter,
the lady of the house, having left the room she usually occupies, sleeps
that night on the ground floor.  A window is heard to open and shut
during the night.  When we, who have been during the day trying to find
a clue to the robbery, come to the house, we find the stolen goods in a
room close to where she slept, and opening out of it!""

He stopped.  I felt that same sense of pain and apprehension, which I
had experienced when he had spoken to me before, creeping, or rather
rushing, over me again.  I had to face the matter out, however.  My
relations with her, and the feeling toward her which I now knew full
well meant a very deep love and devotion, demanded so much.  I said as
calmly as I could, for I knew the keen eyes of the skilful investigator
were on me:

""And the inference?""

He answered with the cool audacity of conviction:

""The inference to me is that there was no robbery at all.  The goods
were taken by someone to this house, where they were received through a
window on the ground floor.  They were placed in the cabinet, ready to
be discovered when the proper time should come!""

Somehow I felt relieved; the assumption was too monstrous.  I did not
want, however, my relief to be apparent, so I answered as gravely as I
could:

""And who do you suppose brought them to the house?""

""I keep my mind open as to that.  Possibly Mr. Corbeck himself; the
matter might be too risky to trust to a third party.""

""Then the natural extension of your inference is that Mr. Corbeck is a
liar and a fraud; and that he is in conspiracy with Miss Trelawny to
deceive someone or other about those lamps.""

""Those are harsh words, Mr. Ross.  They're so plain-spoken that they
bring a man up standing, and make new doubts for him.  But I have to go
where my reason points.  It may be that there is another party than Miss
Trelawny in it.  Indeed, if it hadn't been for the other matter that set
me thinking and bred doubts of its own about her, I wouldn't dream of
mixing her up in this.  But I'm safe on Corbeck.  Whoever else is in it,
he is!  The things couldn't have been taken without his connivance-if
what he says is true.  If it isn't-well! he is a liar anyhow.  I would
think it a bad job to have him stay in the house with so many valuables,
only that it will give me and my mate a chance of watching him.  we'll
keep a pretty good look-out, too, I tell you.  He's up in my room now,
guarding those lamps; but Johnny Wright is there too.  I go on before he
comes off; so there won't be much chance of another house-breaking.  Of
course, Mr. Ross, all this, too, is between you and me.""

""Quite so!  You may depend on my silence!"" I said; and he went away to
keep a close eye on the Egyptologist.

It seemed as though all my painful experiences were to go in pairs, and
that the sequence of the previous day was to be repeated; for before
long I had another private visit from Doctor Winchester who had now paid
his nightly visit to his patient and was on his way home.  He took the
seat which I proffered and began at once:

""This is a strange affair altogether.  Miss Trelawny has just been
telling me about the stolen lamps, and of the finding of them in the
Napoleon cabinet.  It would seem to be another complication of the
mystery; and yet, do you know, it is a relief to me.  I have exhausted
all human and natural possibilities of the case, and am beginning to
fall back on superhuman and supernatural possibilities.  Here are such
strange things that, if I am not going mad, I think we must have a
solution before long.  I wonder if I might ask some questions and some
help from Mr. Corbeck, without making further complications and
embarrassing us.  He seems to know an amazing amount regarding Egypt and
all relating to it.  Perhaps he wouldn't mind translating a little bit
of hieroglyphic.  It is child's play to him.  What do you think?""

When I had thought the matter over a few seconds I spoke.  We wanted all
the help we could get.  For myself, I had perfect confidence in both
men; and any comparing notes, or mutual assistance, might bring good
results.  Such could hardly bring evil.

""By all means I should ask him.  He seems an extraordinarily learned man
in Egyptology; and he seems to me a good fellow as well as an
enthusiast.  By the way, it will be necessary to be a little guarded as
to whom you speak regarding any information which he may give you.""

""Of course!"" he answered.  ""Indeed I should not dream of saying anything
to anybody, excepting yourself.  We have to remember that when Mr.
Trelawny recovers he may not like to think that we have been chattering
unduly over his affairs.""

""Look here!"" I said, ""why not stay for a while:  and I shall ask him to
come and have a pipe with us.  We can then talk over things.""

He acquiesced:  so I went to the room where Mr. Corbeck was, and brought
him back with me.  I thought the detectives were pleased at his going.
On the way to my room he said:

""I don't half like leaving those things there, with only those men to
guard them. They're a deal sight too precious to be left to the police!""

From which it would appear that suspicion was not confined to Sergeant
Daw.

Mr. Corbeck and Doctor Winchester, after a quick glance at each other,
became at once on most friendly terms.  The traveller professed his
willingness to be of any assistance which he could, provided, he added,
that it was anything about which he was free to speak.  This was not
very promising; but Doctor Winchester began at once:

""I want you, if you will, to translate some hieroglyphic for me.""

""Certainly, with the greatest pleasure, so far as I can.  For I may tell
you that hieroglyphic writing is not quite mastered yet; though we are
getting at it!  We are getting at it!  What is the inscription?""

""There are two,"" he answered.  ""One of them I shall bring here.""

He went out, and returned in a minute with the mummy cat which he had
that evening introduced to Silvio.  The scholar took it; and, after a
short examination, said:

""There is nothing especial in this.  It is an appeal to Bast, the Lady
of Bubastis, to give her good bread and milk in the Elysian Fields.
There may be more inside; and if you will care to unroll it, I will do
my best.  I do not think, however, that there is anything special.  From
the method of wrapping I should say it is from the Delta; and of a late
period, when such mummy work was common and cheap.  What is the other
inscription you wish me to see?""

""The inscription on the mummy cat in Mr. Trelawny's room.""

Mr. Corbeck's face fell.  ""No!"" he said, ""I cannot do that!  I am, for
the present at all events, practically bound to secrecy regarding any of
the things in Mr. Trelawny's room.""

Doctor Winchester's comment and my own were made at the same moment.  I
said only the one word ""Checkmate!"" from which I think he may have
gathered that I guessed more of his idea and purpose than perhaps I had
intentionally conveyed to him.  He murmured:

""Practically bound to secrecy?""

Mr. Corbeck at once took up the challenge conveyed:

""Do not misunderstand me!  I am not bound by any definite pledge of
secrecy; but I am bound in honour to respect Mr. Trelawny's confidence,
given to me, I may tell you, in a very large measure.  Regarding many of
the objects in his room he has a definite purpose in view; and it would
not be either right or becoming for me, his trusted friend and
confidant, to forestall that purpose.  Mr. Trelawny, you may know--or
rather you do not know or you would not have so construed my remark--is
a scholar, a very great scholar.  He has worked for years toward a
certain end.  For this he has spared no labour, no expense, no personal
danger or self-denial.  He is on the line of a result which will place
him amongst the foremost discoverers or investigators of his age.  And
now, just at the time when any hour might bring him success, he is
stricken down!""

He stopped, seemingly overcome with emotion.  After a time he recovered
himself and went on:

""Again, do not misunderstand me as to another point.  I have said that
Mr. Trelawny has made much confidence with me; but I do not mean to lead
you to believe that I know all his plans, or his aims or objects.  I
know the period which he has been studying; and the definite historical
individual whose life he has been investigating, and whose records he
has been following up one by one with infinite patience.  But beyond
this I know nothing.  That he has some aim or object in the completion
of this knowledge I am convinced.  What it is I may guess; but I must
say nothing. Please to remember, gentlemen, that I have voluntarily
accepted the position of recipient of a partial confidence.  I have
respected that; and I must ask any of my friends to do the same.""

He spoke with great dignity; and he grew, moment by moment, in the
respect and esteem of both Doctor Winchester and myself.  We understood
that he had not done speaking; so we waited in silence till he
continued:

""I have spoken this much, although I know well that even such a hint as
either of you might gather from my words might jeopardise the success of
his work.  But I am convinced that you both wish to help him--and his
daughter,"" he said this looking me fairly between the eyes, ""to the best
of your power, honestly and unselfishly.  He is so stricken down, and
the manner of it is so mysterious that I cannot but think that it is in
some way a result of his own work.  That he calculated on some set-back
is manifest to us all.  God knows! I am willing to do what I can, and to
use any knowledge I have in his behalf.  I arrived in England full of
exultation at the thought that I had fulfilled the mission with which he
had trusted me.  I had got what he said were the last objects of his
search; and I felt assured that he would now be able to begin the
experiment of which he had often hinted to me.  It is too dreadful that
at just such a time such a calamity should have fallen on him.  Doctor
Winchester, you are a physician; and, if your face does not belie you,
you are a clever and a bold one.  Is there no way which you can devise
to wake this man from his unnatural stupor?""

There was a pause; then the answer came slowly and deliberately:

""There is no ordinary remedy that I know of.  There might possibly be
some extraordinary one.  But there would be no use in trying to find it,
except on one condition.""

""And that?""

""Knowledge!  I am completely ignorant of Egyptian matters, language,
writing, history, secrets, medicines, poisons, occult powers--all that go
to make up the mystery of that mysterious land.  This disease, or
condition, or whatever it may be called, from which Mr. Trelawny is
suffering, is in some way connected with Egypt.  I have had a suspicion
of this from the first; and later it grew into a certainty, though
without proof.  What you have said tonight confirms my conjecture, and
makes me believe that a proof is to be had.  I do not think that you
quite know all that has gone on in this house since the night of the
attack--of the finding of Mr. Trelawny's body. Now I propose that we
confide in you.  If Mr. Ross agrees, I shall ask him to tell you. He is
more skilled than I am in putting facts before other people.  He can
speak by his brief; and in this case he has the best of all briefs, the
experience of his own eyes and ears, and the evidence that he has
himself taken on the spot from participators in, or spectators of, what
has happened.  When you know all, you will, I hope, be in a position to
judge as to whether you can best help Mr. Trelawny, and further his
secret wishes, by your silence or your speech.""

I nodded approval.  Mr. Corbeck jumped up, and in his impulsive way held
out a hand to each.

""Done!"" he said.  ""I acknowledge the honour of your confidence; and on
my part I pledge myself that if I find my duty to Mr. Trelawny's wishes
will, in his own interest, allow my lips to open on his affairs, I shall
speak so freely as I may.""

Accordingly I began, and told him, as exactly as I could, everything
that had happened from the moment of my waking at the knocking on the
door in Jermyn Street.  The only reservations I made were as to my own
feeling toward Miss Trelawny and the matters of small import to the main
subject which followed it; and my conversations with Sergeant Daw, which
were in themselves private, and which would have demanded discretionary
silence in any case.  As I spoke, Mr. Corbeck followed with breathless
interest.  Sometimes he would stand up and pace about the room in
uncontrollable excitement; and then recover himself suddenly, and sit
down again.  Sometimes he would be about to speak, but would, with an
effort, restrain himself.  I think the narration helped me to make up my
own mind; for even as I talked, things seemed to appear in a clearer
light.  Things big and little, in relation of their importance to the
case, fell into proper perspective.  The story up to date became
coherent, except as to its cause, which seemed a greater mystery than
ever.  This is the merit of entire, or collected, narrative.  Isolated
facts, doubts, suspicions, conjectures, give way to a homogeneity which
is convincing.

That Mr. Corbeck was convinced was evident.  He did not go through any
process of explanation or limitation, but spoke right out at once to the
point, and fearlessly like a man:

""That settles me!  There is in activity some Force that needs special
care.  If we all go on working in the dark we shall get in one another's
way, and by hampering each other, undo the good that any or each of us,
working in different directions, might do.  It seems to me that the
first thing we have to accomplish is to get Mr. Trelawny waked out of
that unnatural sleep.  That he can be waked is apparent from the way the
Nurse has recovered; though what additional harm may have been done to
him in the time he has been lying in that room I suppose no one can
tell.  We must chance that, however.  He has lain there, and whatever
the effect might be, it is there now; and we have, and shall have, to
deal with it as a fact.  A day more or less won't hurt in the long-run.
It is late now; and we shall probably have tomorrow a task before us
that will require our energies afresh.  You, Doctor, will want to get to
your sleep; for I suppose you have other work as well as this to do
tomorrow.  As for you, Mr. Ross, I understand that you are to have a
spell of watching in the sick-room tonight.  I shall get you a book
which will help to pass the time for you.  I shall go and look for it in
the library.  I know where it was when I was here last; and I don't
suppose Mr. Trelawny has used it since.  He knew long ago all that was
in it which was or might be of interest to him.  But it will be
necessary, or at least helpful, to understand other things which I shall
tell you later.  You will be able to tell Doctor Winchester all that
would aid him.  For I take it that our work will branch out pretty soon.
We shall each have our own end to hold up; and it will take each of us
all our time and understanding to get through his own tasks.  It will
not be necessary for you to read the whole book.  All that will interest
you--with regard to our matter I mean of course, for the whole book is
interesting as a record of travel in a country then quite unknown--is the
preface, and two or three chapters which I shall mark for you.""

He shook hands warmly with Doctor Winchester who had stood up to go.

Whilst he was away I sat lonely, thinking.  As I thought, the world
around me seemed to be illimitably great.  The only little spot in which
I was interested seemed like a tiny speck in the midst of a wilderness.
Without and around it were darkness and unknown danger, pressing in from
every side.  And the central figure in our little oasis was one of
sweetness and beauty.  A figure one could love; could work for; could
die for . . . !

Mr. Corbeck came back in a very short time with the book; he had found
it at once in the spot where he had seen it three years before.  Having
placed in it several slips of paper, marking the places where I was to
read, he put it into my hands, saying:

""That is what started Mr. Trelawny; what started me when I read it; and
which will, I have no doubt, be to you an interesting beginning to a
special study--whatever the end may be.  If, indeed, any of us here may
ever see the end.""

At the door he paused and said:

""I want to take back one thing.  That Detective is a good fellow.  What
you have told me of him puts him in a new light.  The best proof of it
is that I can go quietly to sleep tonight, and leave the lamps in his
care!""

When he had gone I took the book with me, put on my respirator, and went
to my spell of duty in the sick-room!





Chapter X
The Valley of the Sorcerer

I placed the book on the little table on which the shaded lamp rested
and moved the screen to one side.  Thus I could have the light on my
book; and by looking up, see the bed, and the Nurse, and the door.  I
cannot say that the conditions were enjoyable, or calculated to allow of
that absorption in the subject which is advisable for effective study.
However, I composed myself to the work as well as I could.  The book was
one which, on the very face of it, required special attention.  It was a
folio in Dutch, printed in Amsterdam in 1650.  Some one had made a
literal translation, writing generally the English word under the Dutch,
so that the grammatical differences between the two tongues made even
the reading of the translation a difficult matter.  One had to dodge
backward and forward among the words.  This was in addition to the
difficulty of deciphering a strange handwriting of two hundred years
ago.  I found, however, that after a short time I got into the habit of
following in conventional English the Dutch construction; and, as I
became more familiar with the writing, my task became easier.

At first the circumstances of the room, and the fear lest Miss Trelawny
should return unexpectedly and find me reading the book, disturbed me
somewhat.  For we had arranged amongst us, before Doctor Winchester had
gone home, that she was not to be brought into the range of the coming
investigation.  We considered that there might be some shock to a
woman's mind in matters of apparent mystery; and further, that she,
being Mr. Trelawny's daughter, might be placed in a difficult position
with him afterward if she took part in, or even had a personal knowledge
of, the disregarding of his expressed wishes.  But when I remembered
that she did not come on nursing duty till two o'clock, the fear of
interruption passed away.  I had still nearly three house before me.
Nurse Kennedy sat in her chair by the bedside, patient and alert.  A
clock ticked on the landing; other clocks in the house ticked; the life
of the city without manifested itself in the distant hum, now and again
swelling into a roar as a breeze floating westward took the concourse of
sounds with it.  But still the dominant idea was of silence.  The light
on my book, and the soothing fringe of green silk round the shade
intensified, whenever I looked up, the gloom of the sick-room.  With
every line I read, this seemed to grow deeper and deeper; so that when
my eyes came back to the page the light seemed to dazzle me.  I stuck to
my work, however, and presently began to get sufficiently into the
subject to become interested in it.

The book was by one Nicholas van Huyn of Hoorn.  In the preface he told
how, attracted by the work of John Greaves of Merton College,
Pyramidographia, he himself visited Egypt, where he became so interested
in its wonders that he devoted some years of his life to visiting
strange places, and exploring the ruins of many temples and tombs.  He
had come across many variants of the story of the building of the
Pyramids as told by the Arabian historian, Ibn Abd Alhokin, some of
which he set down.  These I did not stop to read, but went on to the
marked pages.

As soon as I began to read these, however, there grew on me some sense
of a disturbing influence.  Once or twice I looked to see if the Nurse
had moved, for there was a feeling as though some one were near me.
Nurse Kennedy sat in her place, as steady and alert as ever; and I came
back to my book again.

The narrative went on to tell how, after passing for several days
through the mountains to the east of Aswan, the explorer came to a
certain place.  Here I give his own words, simply putting the
translation into modern English:

""Toward evening we came to the entrance of a narrow, deep valley,
running east and west.  I wished to proceed through this; for the sun,
now nearly down on the horizon, showed a wide opening beyond the
narrowing of the cliffs.  But the fellaheen absolutely refused to enter
the valley at such a time, alleging that they might be caught by the
night before they could emerge from the other end.  At first they would
give no reason for their fear.  They had hitherto gone anywhere I
wished, and at any time, without demur.  On being pressed, however, they
said that the place was the Valley of the Sorcerer, where none might
come in the night.  On being asked to tell of the Sorcerer, they
refused, saying that there was no name, and that they knew nothing.  On
the next morning, however, when the sun was up and shining down the
valley, their fears had somewhat passed away.  Then they told me that a
great Sorcerer in ancient days--'millions of millions of years' was the
term they used--a King or a Queen, they could not say which, was buried
there.  They could not give the name, persisting to the last that there
was no name; and that anyone who should name it would waste away in life
so that at death nothing of him would remain to be raised again in the
Other World.  In passing through the valley they kept together in a
cluster, hurrying on in front of me.  None dared to remain behind. They
gave, as their reason for so proceeding, that the arms of the Sorcerer
were long, and that it was dangerous to be the last.  The which was of
little comfort to me who of this necessity took that honourable post.
In the narrowest part of the valley, on the south side, was a great
cliff of rock, rising sheer, of smooth and even surface. Hereon were
graven certain cabalistic signs, and many figures of men and animals,
fishes, reptiles and birds; suns and stars; and many quaint symbols.
Some of these latter were disjointed limbs and features, such as arms
and legs, fingers, eyes, noses, ears, and lips.  Mysterious symbols
which will puzzle the Recording Angel to interpret at the Judgment Day.
The cliff faced exactly north.  There was something about it so strange,
and so different from the other carved rocks which I had visited, that I
called a halt and spent the day in examining the rock front as well as I
could with my telescope.  The Egyptians of my company were terribly
afraid, and used every kind of persuasion to induce me to pass on.  I
stayed till late in the afternoon, by which time I had failed to make
out aright the entry of any tomb, for I suspected that such was the
purpose of the sculpture of the rock.  By this time the men were
rebellious; and I had to leave the valley if I did not wish my whole
retinue to desert.  But I secretly made up my mind to discover the tomb,
and explore it.  To this end I went further into the mountains, where I
met with an Arab Sheik who was willing to take service with me.  The
Arabs were not bound by the same superstitious fears as the Egyptians;
Sheik Abu Some and his following were willing to take a part in the
explorations.

""When I returned to the valley with these Bedouins, I made effort to
climb the face of the rock, but failed, it being of one impenetrable
smoothness.  The stone, generally flat and smooth by nature, had been
chiselled to completeness.  That there had been projecting steps was
manifest, for there remained, untouched by the wondrous climate of that
strange land, the marks of saw and chisel and mallet where the steps had
been cut or broken away.

""Being thus baffled of winning the tomb from below, and being unprovided
with ladders to scale, I found a way by much circuitous journeying to
the top of the cliff. Thence I caused myself to be lowered by ropes,
till I had investigated that portion of the rock face wherein I expected
to find the opening.  I found that there was an entrance, closed however
by a great stone slab.  This was cut in the rock more than a hundred
feet up, being two-thirds the height of the cliff.  The hieroglyphic and
cabalistic symbols cut in the rock were so managed as to disguise it.
The cutting was deep, and was continued through the rock and the portals
of the doorway, and through the great slab which formed the door itself.
This was fixed in place with such incredible exactness that no stone
chisel or cutting implement which I had with me could find a lodgment in
the interstices.  I used much force, however; and by many heavy strokes
won a way into the tomb, for such I found it to be.  The stone door
having fallen into the entrance I passed over it into the tomb, noting
as I went a long iron chain which hung coiled on a bracket close to the
doorway.

""The tomb I found to be complete, after the manner of the finest
Egyptian tombs, with chamber and shaft leading down to the corridor,
ending in the Mummy Pit.  It had the table of pictures, which seems some
kind of record--whose meaning is now for ever lost--graven in a wondrous
colour on a wondrous stone.

""All the walls of the chamber and the passage were carved with strange
writings in the uncanny form mentioned.  The huge stone coffin or
sarcophagus in the deep pit was marvellously graven throughout with
signs.  The Arab chief and two others who ventured into the tomb with
me, and who were evidently used to such grim explorations, managed to
take the cover from the sarcophagus without breaking it. At which they
wondered; for such good fortune, they said, did not usually attend such
efforst.  Indeed they seemed not over careful; and did handle the
various furniture of the tomb with such little concern that, only for
its great strength and thickness, even the coffin itself might have been
injured.  Which gave me much concern, for it was very beautifully
wrought of rare stone, such as I had no knowledge of.  Much I grieved
that it were not possible to carry it away.  But time and desert
journeyings forbade such; I could only take with me such small matters
as could be carried on the person.

""Within the sarcophagus was a body, manifestly of a woman, swathed with
many wrappings of linen, as is usual with all mummies.  From certain
embroiderings thereon, I gathered that she was of high rank.  Across the
breast was one hand, unwrapped.  In the mummies which I had seen, the
arms and hands are within the wrappings, and certain adornments of wood,
shaped and painted to resemble arms and hands, lie outside the enwrapped
body.

""But this hand was strange to see, for it was the real hand of her who
lay enwrapped there; the arm projecting from the cerements being of
flesh, seemingly made as like marble in the process of embalming.  Arm
and hand were of dusky white, being of the hue of ivory that hath lain
long in air.  The skin and the nails were complete and whole, as though
the body had been placed for burial over night.  I touched the hand and
moved it, the arm being something flexible as a live arm; though stiff
with long disuse, as are the arms of those faqueers which I have seen in
the Indees.  There was, too, an added wonder that on this ancient hand
were no less than seven fingers, the same all being fine and long, and
of great beauty.  Sooth to say, it made me shudder and my flesh creep to
touch that hand that had lain there undisturbed for so many thousands of
years, and yet was like unto living flesh.  Underneath the hand, as
though guarded by it, lay a huge jewel of ruby; a great stone of
wondrous bigness, for the ruby is in the main a small jewel.  This one
was of wondrous colour, being as of fine blood whereon the light
shineth.  But its wonder lay not in its size or colour, though these
were, as I have said, of priceless rarity; but in that the light of it
shone from seven stars, each of seven points, as clearly as though the
stars were in reality there imprisoned.  When that the hand was lifted,
the sight of that wondrous stone lying there struck me with a shock
almost to momentary paralysis.  I stood gazing on it, as did those with
me, as though it were that faded head of the Gorgon Medusa with the
snakes in her hair, whose sight struck into stone those who beheld.  So
strong was the feeling that I wanted to hurry away from the place.  So,
too, those with me; therefore, taking this rare jewel, together with
certain amulets of strangeness and richness being wrought of
jewel-stones, I made haste to depart.  I would have remained longer, and
made further research in the wrappings of the mummy, but that I feared
so to do.  For it came to me all at once that I was in a desert place,
with strange men who were with me because they were not over-scrupulous.
That we were in a lone cavern of the dead, an hundred feet above the
ground, where none could find me were ill done to me, nor would any ever
seek. But in secret I determined that I would come again, though with
more secure following.  Moreover, was I tempted to seek further, as in
examining the wrappings I saw many things of strange import in that
wondrous tomb; including a casket of eccentric shape made of some
strange stone, which methought might have contained other jewels,
inasmuch as it had secure lodgment in the great sarcophagus itself.
There was in the tomb also another coffer which, though of rare
proportion and adornment, was more simply shaped.  It was of ironstone
of great thickness; but the cover was lightly cemented down with what
seemed gum and Paris plaster, as though to insure that no air could
penetrate.  The Arabs with me so insisted in its opening, thinking that
from its thickness much treasure was stored therein, that I consented
thereto.  But their hope was a false one, as it proved.  Within, closely
packed, stood four jars finely wrought and carved with various
adornments.  Of these one was the head of a man, another of a dog,
another of a jackal, and another of a hawk.  I had before known that
such burial urns as these were used to contain the entrails and other
organs of the mummied dead; but on opening these, for the fastening of
wax, though complete, was thin, and yielded easily, we found that they
held but oil.  The Bedouins, spilling most of the oil in the process,
groped with their hands in the jars lest treasure should have been there
concealed.  But their searching was of no avail; no treasure was there.
I was warned of my danger by seeing in the eyes of the Arabs certain
covetous glances.  Whereon, in order to hasten their departure, I
wrought upon those fears of superstition which even in these callous men
were apparent.  The chief of the Bedouins ascended from the Pit to give
the signal to those above to raise us; and I, not caring to remain with
the men whom I mistrusted, followed him immediately.  The others did not
come at once; from which I feared that they were rifling the tomb afresh
on their own account.  I refrained to speak of it, however, lest worse
should befall.  At last they came.  One of them, who ascended first, in
landing at the top of the cliff lost his foothold and fell below.  He
was instantly killed.  The other followed, but in safety. The chief came
next, and I came last.  Before coming away I pulled into its place
again, as well as I could, the slab of stone that covered the entrance
to the tomb.  I wished, if possible, to preserve it for my own
examination should I come again.

""When we all stood on the hill above the cliff, the burning sun that was
bright and full of glory was good to see after the darkness and strange
mystery of the tomb. Even was I glad that the poor Arab who fell down
the cliff and lay dead below, lay in the sunlight and not in that gloomy
cavern.  I would fain have gone with my companions to seek him and give
him sepulture of some kind; but the Sheik made light of it, and sent two
of his men to see to it whilst we went on our way.

""That night as we camped, one of the men only returned, saying that a
lion of the desert had killed his companion after that they had buried
the dead man in a deep sand without the valley, and had covered the spot
where he lay with many great rocks, so that jackals or other preying
beasts might not dig him up again as is their wont.

""Later, in the light of the fire round which the men sat or lay, I saw
him exhibit to his fellows something white which they seemed to regard
with special awe and reverence.  So I drew near silently, and saw that
it was none other than the white hand of the mummy which had lain
protecting the Jewel in the great sarcophagus. I heard the Bedouin tell
how he had found it on the body of him who had fallen from the cliff.
There was no mistaking it, for there were the seven fingers which I had
noted before.  This man must have wrenched it off the dead body whilst
his chief and I were otherwise engaged; and from the awe of the others I
doubted not that he had hoped to use it as an Amulet, or charm.  Whereas
if powers it had, they were not for him who had taken it from the dead;
since his death followed hard upon his theft.  Already his Amulet had
had an awesome baptism; for the wrist of the dead hand was stained with
red as though it had been dipped in recent blood.

""That night I was in certain fear lest there should be some violence
done to me; for if the poor dead hand was so valued as a charm, what
must be the worth in such wise of the rare Jewel which it had guarded.
Though only the chief knew of it, my doubt was perhaps even greater; for
he could so order matters as to have me at his mercy when he would.  I
guarded myself, therefore, with wakefulness so well as I could,
determined that at my earliest opportunity I should leave this party,
and complete my journeying home, first to the Nile bank, and then down
its course to Alexandria; with other guides who knew not what strange
matters I had with me.

""At last there came over me a disposition of sleep, so potent that I
felt it would be resistless.  Fearing attack, or that being searched in
my sleep the Bedouin might find the Star Jewel which he had seen me
place with others in my dress, I took it out unobserved and held it in
my hand.  It seemed to give back the light of the flickering fire and
the light of the stars--for there was no moon--with equal fidelity; and I
could note that on its reverse it was graven deeply with certain signs
such as I had seen in the tomb.  As I sank into the unconsciousness of
sleep, the graven Star Jewel was hidden in the hollow of my clenched
hand.

""I waked out of sleep with the light of the morning sun on my face.  I
sat up and looked around me.  The fire was out, and the camp was
desolate; save for one figure which lay prone close to me.  It was that
of the Arab chief, who lay on his back, dead.  His face was almost
black; and his eyes were open, and staring horribly up at the sky, as
though he saw there some dreadful vision.  He had evidently been
strangled; for on looking, I found on his throat the red marks where
fingers had pressed.  There seemed so many of these marks that I counted
them.  There were seven; and all parallel, except the thumb mark, as
though made with one hand.  This thrilled me as I thought of the mummy
hand with the seven fingers.

""Even there, in the open desert, it seemed as if there could be
enchantments!

""In my surprise, as I bent over him, I opened my right hand, which up to
now I had held shut with the feeling, instinctive even in sleep, of
keeping safe that which it held.  As I did so, the Star Jewel held there
fell out and struck the dead man on the mouth.  Mirabile dictu there
came forth at once from the dead mouth a great gush of blood, in which
the red jewel was for the moment lost.  I turned the dead man over to
look for it, and found that he lay with his right hand bent under him as
though he had fallen on it; and in it he held a great knife, keen of
point and edge, such as Arabs carry at the belt.  It may have been that
he was about to murder me when vengeance came on him, whether from man
or God, or the Gods of Old, I know not.  Suffice it, that when I found
my Ruby Jewel, which shone up as a living star from the mess of blood
wherein it lay, I paused not, but fled from the place. I journeyed on
alone through the hot desert, till, by God's grace, I came upon an Arab
tribe camping by a well, who gave me salt.  With them I rested till they
had set me on my way.

""I know not what became of the mummy hand, or of those who had it.  What
strife, or suspicion, or disaster, or greed went with it I know not; but
some such cause there must have been, since those who had it fled with
it.  It doubtless is used as a charm of potence by some desert tribe.

""At the earliest opportunity I made examination of the Star Ruby, as I
wished to try to understand what was graven on it.  The symbols--whose
meaning, however, I could not understand--were as follows . . .""

Twice, whilst I had been reading this engrossing narrative, I had
thought that I had seen across the page streaks of shade, which the
weirdness of the subject had made to seem like the shadow of a hand.  On
the first of these occasions I found that the illusion came from the
fringe of green silk around the lamp; but on the second I had looked up,
and my eyes had lit on the mummy hand across the room on which the
starlight was falling under the edge of the blind.  It was of little
wonder that I had connected it with such a narrative; for if my eyes
told me truly, here, in this room with me, was the very hand of which
the traveller Van Huyn had written.  I looked over at the bed; and it
comforted me to think that the Nurse still sat there, calm and wakeful.
At such a time, with such surrounds, during such a narrative, it was
well to have assurance of the presence of some living person.

I sat looking at the book on the table before me; and so many strange
thoughts crowded on me that my mind began to whirl.  It was almost as if
the light on the white fingers in front of me was beginning to have some
hypnotic effect.  All at once, all thoughts seemed to stop; and for an
instant the world and time stood still.

There lay a real hand across the book!  What was there to so overcome
me, as was the case?  I knew the hand that I saw on the book--and loved
it.  Margaret Trelawny's hand was a joy to me to see--to touch; and yet
at that moment, coming after other marvellous things, it had a strangely
moving effect on me.  It was but momentary, however, and had passed even
before her voice had reached me.

""What disturbs you?  What are you staring at the book for?  I thought
for an instant that you must have been overcome again!""  I jumped up.

""I was reading,"" I said, ""an old book from the library.""  As I spoke I
closed it and put it under my arm.  ""I shall now put it back, as I
understand that your Father wishes all things, especially books, kept in
their proper places.""  My words were intentionally misleading; for I did
not wish her to know what I was reading, and thought it best not to wake
her curiosity by leaving the book about.  I went away, but not to the
library; I left the book in my room where I could get it when I had had
my sleep in the day.  When I returned Nurse Kennedy was ready to go to
bed; so Miss Trelawny watched with me in the room.  I did not want any
book whilst she was present.  We sat close together and talked in a
whisper whilst the moments flew by.  It was with surprise that I noted
the edge of the curtains changing from grey to yellow light. What we
talked of had nothing to do with the sick man, except in so far that all
which concerned his daughter must ultimately concern him.  But it had
nothing to say to Egypt, or mummies, or the dead, or caves, or Bedouin
chiefs.  I could well take note in the growing light that Margaret's
hand had not seven fingers, but five; for it lay in mine.

When Doctor Winchester arrived in the morning and had made his visit to
his patient, he came to see me as I sat in the dining-room having a
little meal--breakfast or supper, I hardly knew which it was--before I
went to lie down.  Mr. Corbeck came in at the same time; and we resumed
out conversation where we had left it the night before.  I told Mr.
Corbeck that I had read the chapter about the finding of the tomb, and
that I thought Doctor Winchester should read it, too.  The latter said
that, if he might, he would take it with him; he had that morning to
make a railway journey to Ipswich, and would read it on the train.  He
said he would bring it back with him when he came again in the evening.
I went up to my room to bring it down; but I could not find it anywhere.
I had a distinct recollection of having left it on the little table
beside my bed, when I had come up after Miss Trelawny's going on duty
into the sick-room.  It was very strange; for the book was not of a kind
that any of the servants would be likely to take.  I had to come back
and explain to the others that I could not find it.

When Doctor Winchester had gone, Mr. Corbeck, who seemed to know the
Dutchman's work by heart, talked the whole matter over with me.  I told
him that I was interrupted by a change of nurses, just as I had come to
the description of the ring.  He smiled as he said:

""So far as that is concerned, you need not be disappointed.  Not in Van
Huyn's time, nor for nearly two centuries later, could the meaning of
that engraving have been understood.  It was only when the work was
taken up and followed by Young and Champollion, by Birch and Lepsius and
Rosellini and Salvolini, by Mariette Bey and by Wallis Budge and
Flinders Petrie and the other scholars of their times that great results
ensued, and that the true meaning of hieroglyphic was known.

""Later, I shall explain to you, if Mr. Trelawny does not explain it
himself, or if he does not forbid me to, what it means in that
particular place.  I think it will be better for you to know what
followed Van Huyn's narrative; for with the description of the stone,
and the account of his bringing it to Holland at the termination of his
travels, the episode ends.  Ends so far as his book is concerned.  The
chief thing about the book is that it sets others thinking--and acting.
Amongst them were Mr. Trelawny and myself.  Mr. Trelawny is a good
linguist of the Orient, but he does not know Northern tongues.  As for
me I have a faculty for learning languages; and when I was pursuing my
studies in Leyden I leaned Dutch so that I might more easily make
references in the library there.  Thus it was, that at the very time
when Mr. Trelawny, who, in making his great collection of works on
Egypt, had, through a booksellers' catalogue, acquired this volume with
the manuscript translation, was studying it, I was reading another copy,
in original Dutch, in Leyden.  We were both struck by the description of
the lonely tomb in the rock; cut so high up as to be inaccessible to
ordinary seekers:  with all means of reaching it carefully obliterated;
and yet with such an elaborate ornamentation of the smoothed surface of
the cliff as Van Huyn has described.  It also struck us both as an odd
thing--for in the years between Van Huyn's time and our own the general
knowledge of Egyptian curios and records has increased marvellously--that
in the case of such a tomb, made in such a place, and which must have
cost an immense sum of money, there was no seeming record or effigy to
point out who lay within.  Moreover, the very name of the place, 'the
Valley of the Sorcerer', had, in a prosaid age, attractions of its own.
When we met, which we did through his seeking the assistance of other
Egyptologists in his work, we talked over this as we did over many other
things; and we determined to make search for the mysterious valley.
Whilst we were waiting to start on the travel, for many things were
required which Mr. Trelawny undertook to see to himself, I went to
Holland to try if I could by any traces verify Van Huyn's narrative.  I
went straight to Hoorn, and set patiently to work to find the house of
the traveller and his descendants, if any.  I need not trouble you with
details of my seeking--and finding. Hoorn is a place that has not changed
much since Van Huyn's time, except that it has lost the place which it
held amongst commercial cities.  Its externals are such as they had been
then; in such a sleepy old place a century or two does not count for
much.  I found the house, and discovered that none of the descendants
were alive. I searched records; but only to one end--death and
extinction.  Then I set me to work to find what had become of his
treasures; for that such a traveller must have had great treasures was
apparent.  I traced a good many to museums in Leyden, Utrecht, and
Amsterdam; and some few to the private houses of rich collectors.  At
last, in the shop of an old watchmaker and jeweller at Hoorn, I found
what he considered his chiefest treasure; a great ruby, carven like a
scarab, with seven stars, and engraven with hieroglyphics.  The old man
did not know hieroglyphic character, and in his old-world, sleepy life,
the philological discoveries of recent years had not reached him.  He
did not know anything of Van Huyn, except that such a person had been,
and that his name was, during two centuries, venerated in the town as a
great traveller.  He valued the jewel as only a rare stone, spoiled in
part by the cutting; and though he was at first loth to part with such
an unique gem, he became amenable ultimately to commercial reason.  I
had a full purse, since I bought for Mr. Trelawny, who is, as I suppose
you know, immensely wealthy.  I was shortly on my way back to London,
with the Star Ruby safe in my pocket-book; and in my heart a joy and
exultation which knew no bounds.

""For here we were with proof of Van Huyn's wonderful story.  The jewel
was put in security in Mr. Trelawny's great safe; and we started out on
our journey of exploration in full hope.

""Mr. Trelawny was, at the last, loth to leave his young wife whom he
dearly loved; but she, who loved him equally, knew his longing to
prosecute the search.  So keeping to herself, as all good women do, all
her anxieties--which in her case were special--she bade him follow out
his bent.""





Chapter XI
A Queen's Tomb

""Mr. Trelawny's hope was at least as great as my own.  He is not so
volatile a man as I am, prone to ups and downs of hope and despair; but
he has a fixed purpose which crystallises hope into belief.  At times I
had feared that there might have been two such stones, or that the
adventures of Van Huyn were traveller's fictions, based on some ordinary
acquisition of the curio in Alexandria or Cairo, or London or Amsterdam.
But Mr. Trelawny never faltered in his belief.  We had many things to
distract our minds from belief or disbelief.  This was soon after Arabi
Pasha, and Egypt was so safe place for travellers, especially if they
were English.  But Mr. Trelawny is a fearless man; and I almost come to
think at times that I am not a coward myself.  We got together a band of
Arabs whom one or other of us had known in former trips to the desert,
and whom we could trust; that is, we did not distrust them as much as
others.  We were numerous enough to protect ourselves from chance
marauding bands, and we took with us large impedimenta.  We had secured
the consent and passive co-operation of the officials still friendly to
Britain; in the acquiring of which consent I need hardly say that Mr.
Trelawny's riches were of chief importance.  We found our way in
dhahabiyehs to Aswan; whence, having got some Arabs from the Sheik and
having given our usual backsheesh, we set out on our journey through the
desert.

""Well, after much wandering and trying every winding in the interminable
jumble of hills, we came at last at nightfall on just such a valley as
Van Huyn had described. A valley with high, steep cliffs; narrowing in
the centre, and widening out to the eastern and western ends.  At
daylight we were opposite the cliff and could easily note the opening
high up in the rock, and the hieroglyphic figures which were evidently
intended originally to conceal it.

""But the signs which had baffled Van Huyn and those of his time--and
later, were no secrets to us.  The host of scholars who have given their
brains and their lives to this work, had wrested open the mysterious
prison-house of Egyptian language.  On the hewn face of the rocky cliff
we, who had learned the secrets, could read what the Theban priesthood
had had there inscribed nearly fifty centuries before.

""For that the external inscription was the work of the priesthood--and a
hostile priesthood at that--there could be no living doubt.  The
inscription on the rock, written in hieroglyphic, ran thus:

""'Hither the Gods come not at any summons.  The ""Nameless One"" has
insulted them and is for ever alone.  Go not nigh, lest their vengeance
wither you away!'

""The warning must have been a terribly potent one at the time it was
written and for thousands of years afterwards; even when the language in
which it was given had become a dead mystery to the people of the land.
The tradition of such a terror lasts longer than its cause.  Even in the
symbols used there was an added significance of alliteration.  'For
ever' is given in the hieroglyphics as 'millions of years'.  This symbol
was repeated nine times, in three groups of three; and after each group
a symbol of the Upper World, the Under World, and the Sky.  So that for
this Lonely One there could be, through the vengeance of all the Gods,
resurrection in neither the World of Sunlight, in the World of the Dead,
or for the soul in the region of the Gods.

""Neither Mr. Trelawny nor I dared to tell any of our people what the
writing meant. For though they did not believe in the religion whence
the curse came, or in the Gods whose vengeance was threatened, yet they
were so superstitious that they would probably, had they known of it,
have thrown up the whole task and run away.

""Their ignorance, however, and our discretion preserved us.  We made an
encampment close at hand, but behind a jutting rock a little further
along the valley, so that they might not have the inscription always
before them.  For even that traditional name of the place:  'The Valley
of the Sorcerer', had a fear for them; and for us through them.  With
the timber which we had brought, we made a ladder up the face of the
rock.  We hung a pulley on a beam fixed to project from the top of the
cliff.  We found the great slab of rock, which formed the door, placed
clumsily in its place and secured by a few stones.  Its own weight kept
it in safe position.  In order to enter, we had to push it in; and we
passed over it.  We found the great coil of chain which Van Huyn had
described fastened into the rock.  There were, however, abundant
evidences amid the wreckage of the great stone door, which had revolved
on iron hinges at top and bottom, that ample provision had been
originally made for closing and fastening it from within.

""Mr. Trelawny and I went alone into the tomb.  We had brought plenty of
lights with us; and we fixed them as we went along.  We wished to get a
complete survey at first, and then make examination of all in detail.
As we went on, we were filled with ever-increasing wonder and delight.
The tomb was one of the most magnificent and beautiful which either of
us had ever seen.  From the elaborate nature of the sculpture and
painting, and the perfection of the workmanship, it was evident that the
tomb was prepared during the lifetime of her for whose resting-place it
was intended.  The drawing of the hieroglyphic pictures was fine, and
the colouring superb; and in that high cavern, far away from even the
damp of the Nile-flood, all was as fresh as when the artists had laid
down their palettes.  There was one thing which we could not avoid
seeing.  That although the cutting on the outside rock was the work of
the priesthood, the smoothing of the cliff face was probably a part of
the tomb-builder's original design.  The symbolism of the painting and
cutting within all gave the same idea.  The outer cavern, partly natural
and partly hewn, was regarded architecturally as only an ante-chamber.
At the end of it, so that it would face the east, was a pillared
portico, hewn out of the solid rock.  The pillars were massive and were
seven-sided, a thing which we had not come across in any other tomb.
Sculptured on the architrave was the Boat of the Moon, containing
Hathor, cow-headed and bearing the disk and plumes, and the dog-headed
Hapi, the God of the North.  It was steered by Harpocrates towards the
north, represented by the Pole Star surrounded by Draco and Ursa Major.
In the latter the stars that form what we call the 'Plough' were cut
larger than any of the other stars; and were filled with gold so that,
in the light of torches, they seemed to flame with a special
significance. Passing within the portico, we found two of the
architectural features of a rock tomb, the Chamber, or Chapel, and the
Pit, all complete as Van Huyn had noticed, though in his day the names
given to these parts by the Egyptians of old were unknown.

""The Stele, or record, which had its place low down on the western wall,
was so remarkable that we examined it minutely, even before going on our
way to find the mummy which was the object of our search.  This Stele
was a great slab of lapis lazuli, cut all over with hieroglyphic figures
of small size and of much beauty.  The cutting was filled in with some
cement of exceeding fineness, and of the colour of pure vermilion.  The
inscription began:

""'Tera, Queen of the Egypts, daughter of Antef, Monarch of the North and
the South.' 'Daughter of the Sun,' 'Queen of the Diadems'.

""It then set out, in full record, the history of her life and reign.

""The signs of sovereignty were given with a truly feminine profusion of
adornment. The united Crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt were, in especial,
cut with exquisite precision.  It was new to us both to find the Hejet
and the Desher--the White and the Red crowns of Upper and Lower
Egypt--on the Stele of a queen; for it was a rule, without exception in
the records, that in ancient Egypt either crown was worn only by a king;
though they are to be found on goddesses.  Later on we found an
explanation, of which I shall say more presently.

""Such an inscription was in itself a matter so startling as to arrest
attention from anyone anywhere at any time; but you can have no
conception of the effect which it had upon us.  Though our eyes were not
the first which had seen it, they were the first which could see it with
understanding since first the slab of rock was fixed in the cliff
opening nearly five thousand years before.  To us was given to read this
message from the dead.  This message of one who had warred against the
Gods of Old, and claimed to have controlled them at a time when the
hierarchy professed to be the only means of exciting their fears or
gaining their good will.

""The walls of the upper chamber of the Pit and the sarcophagus Chamber
were profusely inscribed; all the inscriptions, except that on the
Stele, being coloured with bluish-green pigment.  The effect when seen
sideways as the eye caught the green facets, was that of an old,
discoloured Indian turquoise.

""We descended the Pit by the aid of the tackle we had brought with us.
Trelawny went first.  It was a deep pit, more than seventy feet; but it
had never been filled up. The passage at the bottom sloped up to the
sarcophagus Chamber, and was longer than is usually found.  It had not
been walled up.

""Within, we found a great sarcophagus of yellow stone.  But that I need
not describe; you have seen it in Mr. Trelawny's chamber.  The cover of
it lay on the ground; it had not been cemented, and was just as Van Huyn
had described it.  Needless to say, we were excited as we looked within.
There must, however, be one sense of disappointment.  I could not help
feeling how different must have been the sight which met the Dutch
traveller's eyes when he looked within and found that white hand lying
lifelike above the shrouding mummy cloths.  It is true that a part of
the arm was there, white and ivory like.

""But there was a thrill to us which came not to Van Huyn!

""The end of the wrist was covered with dried blood!  It was as though
the body had bled after death!  The jagged ends of the broken wrist were
rough with the clotted blood; through this the white bone, sticking out,
looked like the matrix of opal.  The blood had streamed down and stained
the brown wrappings as with rust.  Here, then, was full confirmation of
the narrative.  With such evidence of the narrator's truth before us, we
could not doubt the other matters which he had told, such as the blood
on the mummy hand, or marks of the seven fingers on the throat of the
strangled Sheik.

""I shall not trouble you with details of all we saw, or how we learned
all we knew. Part of it was from knowledge common to scholars; part we
read on the Stele in the tomb, and in the sculptures and hieroglyphic
paintings on the walls.

""Queen Tera was of the Eleventh, or Theban Dynasty of Egyptian Kings
which held sway between the twenty-ninth and twenty-fifth centuries
before Christ.  She succeeded as the only child of her father, Antef.
She must have been a girl of extraordinary character as well as ability,
for she was but a young girl when her father died.  Her youth and sex
encouraged the ambitious priesthood, which had then achieved immense
power.  By their wealth and numbers and learning they dominated all
Egypt, more especially the Upper portion.  They were then secretly ready
to make an effort for the achievement of their bold and long-considered
design, that of transferring the governing power from a Kingship to a
Hierarchy. But King Antef had suspected some such movement, and had
taken the precaution of securing to his daughter the allegiance of the
army.  He had also had her taught statecraft, and had even made her
learned in the lore of the very priests themselves. He had used those of
one cult against the other; each being hopeful of some present gain on
its own part by the influence of the King, or of some ultimate gain from
its own influence over his daughter.  Thus, the Princess had been
brought up amongst scribes, and was herself no mean artist.  Many of
these things were told on the walls in pictures or in hieroglyphic
writing of great beauty; and we came to the conclusion that not a few of
them had been done by the Princess herself.  It was not without cause
that she was inscribed on the Stele as 'Protector of the Arts'.

""But the King had gone to further lengths, and had had his daughter
taught magic, by which she had power over Sleep and Will.  This was real
magic--""black"" magic; not the magic of the temples, which, I may explain,
was of the harmless or ""white"" order, and was intended to impress rather
than to effect.  She had been an apt pupil; and had gone further than
her teachers.  Her power and her resources had given her great
opportunities, of which she had availed herself to the full.  She had
won secrets from nature in strange ways; and had even gone to the length
of going down into the tomb herself, having been swathed and coffined
and left as dead for a whole month. The priests had tried to make out
that the real Princess Tera had died in the experiment, and that another
girl had been substituted; but she had conclusively proved their error.
All this was told in pictures of great merit.  It was probably in her
time that the impulse was given in the restoring the artistic greatness
of the Fourth Dynasty which had found its perfection in the days of
Chufu.

""In the Chamber of the sarcophagus were pictures and writings to show
that she had achieved victory over Sleep.  Indeed, there was everywhere
a symbolism, wonderful even in a land and an age of symbolism.
Prominence was given to the fact that she, though a Queen, claimed all
the privileges of kingship and masculinity.  In one place she was
pictured in man's dress, and wearing the White and Red Crowns.  In the
following picture she was in female dress, but still wearing the Crowns
of Upper and Lower Egypt, while the discarded male raiment lay at her
feet.  In every picture where hope, or aim, of resurrection was
expressed there was the added symbol of the North; and in many places--
always in representations of important events, past, present, or
future--was a grouping of the stars of the Plough.  She evidently
regarded this constellation as in some way peculiarly associated with
herself.

""Perhaps the most remarkable statement in the records, both on the STele
and in the mural writings, was that Queen Tera had power to compel the
Gods.  This, by the way, was not an isolated belief in Egyptian history;
but was different in its cause.  She had engraved on a ruby, carved like
a scarab, and having seven stars of seven points, Master Words to compel
all the Gods, both of the Upper and the Under Worlds.

""In the statement it was plainly set forth that the hatred of the
priests was, she knew, stored up for her, and that they would after her
death try to suppress her name.  This was a terrible revenge, I may tell
you, in Egyptian mythology; for without a name no one can after death be
introduced to the Gods, or have prayers said for him. Therefore, she had
intended her resurrection to be after a long time and in a more northern
land, under the constellation whose seven stars had ruled her birth.  To
this end, her hand was to be in the air--'unwrapped'--and in it the Jewel
of Seven Stars, so that wherever there was air she might move even as
her Ka could move!  This, after thinking it over, Mr. Trelawny and I
agreed meant that her body could become astral at command, and so move,
particle by particle, and become whole again when and where required.
Then there was a piece of writing in which allusion was made to a chest
or casket in which were contained all the Gods, and Will, and Sleep, the
two latter being personified by symbols.  The box was mentioned as with
seven sides. It was not much of a surprise to us when, underneath the
feet of the mummy, we found the seven-sided casket, which you have also
seen in Mr. Trelawny's room.  On the underneath part of the wrapping--
linen of the left foot was painted, in the same vermilion colour as that
used in the Stele, the hieroglyphic symbol for much water, and
underneath the right foot the symbol of the earth.  We made out the
symbolism to be that her body, immortal and transferable at will, ruled
both the land and water, air and fire--the latter being exemplified by
the light of the Jewel Stone, and further by the flint and iron which
lay outside the mummy wrappings.

""As we lifted the casket from the sarcophagus, we noticed on its sides
the strange protuberances which you have already seen; but we were
unable at the time to account for them.  There were a few amulets in the
sarcophagus, but none of any special worth or significance.  We took it
that if there were such, they were within the wrappings; or more
probably in the strange casket underneath the mummy's feet.  This,
however, we could not open.  There were signs of there being a cover;
certainly the upper portion and the lower were each in one piece.  The
fine line, a little way from the top, appeared to be where the cover was
fixed; but it was made with such exquisite fineness and finish that the
joining could hardly be seen. Certainly the top could not be moved.  We
took it, that it was in some way fastened from within.  I tell you all
this in order that you may understand things with which you may be in
contact later.  You must suspend your judgment entirely.  Such strange
things have happened regarding this mummy and all around it, that there
is a necessity for new belief somewhere.  It is absolutely impossible to
reconcile certain things which have happened with the ordinary currents
of life or knowledge.

""We stayed around the Valley of the Sorcerer, till we had copied roughly
all the drawings and writings on the walls, ceiling and floor.  We took
with us the Stele of lapis lazuli, whose graven record was coloured with
vermilion pigment.  We took the sarcophagus and the mummy; the stone
chest with the alabaster jars; the tables of bloodstone and alabaster
and onyx and carnelian; and the ivory pillow whose arch rested on
'buckles', round each of which was twisted an uraeus wrought in gold.
We took all the articles which lay in the Chapel, and the Mummy Pit; the
wooden boats with crews and the ushaptiu figures, and the symbolic
amulets.

""When coming away we took down the ladders, and at a distance buried
them in the sand under a cliff, which we noted so that if necessary we
might find them again. Then with our heavy baggage, we set out on our
laborious journey back to the Nile. It was no easy task, I tell you, to
bring the case with that great sarcophagus over the desert.  We had a
rough cart and sufficient men to draw it; but the progress seemed
terribly slow, for we were anxious to get our treasures into a place of
safety.  The night was an anxious time with us, for we feared attack
from some marauding band. But more still we feared some of those with
us.  They were, after all, but predatory, unscrupulous men; and we had
with us a considerable bulk of precious things. They, or at least the
dangerous ones amongst them, did not know why it was so precious; they
took it for granted that it was material treasure of some kind that we
carried.  We had taken the mummy from the sarcophagus, and packed it for
safety of travel in a separate case.  During the first night two
attempts were made to steal things from the cart; and two men were found
dead in the morning.

""On the second night there came on a violent storm, one of those
terrible simooms of the desert which makes one feel his helplessness.
We were overwhelmed with drifting sand.  Some of our Bedouins had fled
before the storm, hoping to find shelter; the rest of us, wrapped in our
bournous, endured with what patience we could.  In the morning, when the
storm had passed, we recovered from under the piles of sand what we
could of our impedimenta.  We found the case in which the mummy had been
packed all broken, but the mummy itself could nowhere be found. We
searched everywhere around, and dug up the sand which had piled around
us; but in vain.  We did not know what to do, for Trelawny had his heart
set on taking home that mummy.  We waited a whole day in hopes that the
Bedouins, who had fled, would return; we had a blind hope that they
might have in some way removed the mummy from the cart, and would
restore it.  That night, just before dawn, Mr. Trelawny woke me up and
whispered in my ear:

""'We must go back to the tomb in the Valley of the Sorcerer.  Show no
hesitation in the morning when I give the orders!  If you ask any
questions as to where we are going it will create suspicion, and will
defeat our purpose.""

""'All right!"" I answered.  ""But why shall we go there?'  His answer
seemed to thrill through me as though it had struck some chord ready
tuned within:

""'We shall find the mummy there!  I am sure of it!'  Then anticipating
doubt or argument he added:

""'Wait, and you shall see!' and he sank back into his blanket again.

""The Arabs were surprised when we retraced our steps; and some of them
were not satisfied.  There was a good deal of friction, and there were
several desertions; so that it was with a diminished following that we
took our way eastward again.  At first the Sheik did not manifest any
curiosity as to our definite destination; but when it became apparent
that we were again making for the Valley of the Sorcerer, he too showed
concern.  This grew as we drew near; till finally at the entrance of the
valley he halted and refused to go further.  He said he would await our
return if we chose to go on alone.  That he would wait three days; but
if by that time we had not returned he would leave.  No offer of money
would tempt him to depart from this resolution.  The only concession he
would make was that he would find the ladders and bring them near the
cliff.  This he did; and then, with the rest of the troop, he went back
to wait at the entrance of the valley.

""Mr. Trelawny and I took ropes and torches, and again ascended to the
tomb.  It was evident that someone had been there in our absence, for
the stone slab which protected the entrance to the tomb was lying flat
inside, and a rope was dangling from the cliff summit.  Within, there
was another rope hanging into the shaft of the Mummy Pit.  We looked at
each other; but neither said a word.  We fixed our own rope, and as
arranged Trelawny descended first, I following at once.  It was not till
we stood together at the foot of the shaft that the thought flashed
across me that we might be in some sort of a trap; that someone might
descend the rope from the cliff, and by cutting the rope by which we had
lowered ourselves into the Pit, bury us there alive.  The thought was
horrifying; but it was too late to do anything.  I remained silent.  We
both had torches, so that there was ample light as we passed through the
passage and entered the Chamber where the sarcophagus had stood. The
first thing noticeable was the emptiness of the place.  Despite all its
magnificent adornment, the tomb was made a desolation by the absence of
the great sarcophagus, to hold which it was hewn in the rock; of the
chest with the alabaster jars; of the tables which had held the
implements and food for the use of the dead, and the ushaptiu figures.

""It was made more infinitely desolate still by the shrouded figure of
the mummy of Queen Tera which lay on the floor where the great
sarcophagus had stood!  Beside it lay, in the strange contorted
attitudes of violent death, three of the Arabs who had deserted from our
party.  Their faces were black, and their hands and necks were smeared
with blood which had burst from mouth and nose and eyes.

""On the throat of each were the marks, now blackening, of a hand of
seven fingers.

""Trelawny and I drew close, and clutched each other in awe and fear as
we looked.

""For, most wonderful of all, across the breast of the mummied Queen lay
a hand of seven fingers, ivory white, the wrist only showing a scar like
a jagged red line, from which seemed to depend drops of blood.""





Chapter XII
The Magic Coffer

""When we recovered our amazement, which seemed to last unduly long, we
did not lose any time carrying the mummy through the passage, and
hoisting it up the Pit shaft.  I went first, to receive it at the top.
As I looked down, I saw Mr. Trelawny lift the severed hand and put it in
his breast, manifestly to save it from being injured or lost.  We left
the dead Arabs where they lay.  With our ropes we lowered our precious
burden to the ground; and then took it to the entrance of the valley
where our escort was to wait.  To our astonishment we found them on the
move.  When we remonstrated with the Sheik, he answered that he had
fulfilled his contract to the letter; he had waited the three days as
arranged.  I thought that he was lying to cover up his base intention of
deserting us; and I found when we compared notes that Trelawny had the
same suspicion.  It was not till we arrived at Cairo that we found he
was correct.  It was the 3rd of November 1884 when we entered the Mummy
Pit for the second time; we had reason to remember the date.

""We had lost three whole days of our reckoning--out of our lives--whilst
we had stood wondering in that chamber of the dead.  Was it strange,
then, that we had a superstitious feeling with regard to the dead Queen
Tera and all belonging to her?  Is it any wonder that it rests with us
now, with a bewildering sense of some power outside ourselves or our
comprehension?  Will it be any wonder if it go down to the grave with us
at the appointed time?  If, indeed, there be any graves for us who have
robbed the dead!""  He was silent for quite a minute before he went on:

""We got to Cairo all right, and from there to Alexandria, where we were
to take ship by the Messagerie service to Marseilles, and go thence by
express to London.  But

     'The best-laid schemes o'  mice and men Gang aft agley.'

At Alexandria, Trelawny found waiting a cable stating that Mrs. Trelawny
had died in giving birth to a daughter.

""Her stricken husband hurried off at once by the Orient Express; and I
had to bring the treasure alone to the desolate house.  I got to London
all safe; there seemed to be some special good fortune to our journey.
When I got to this house, the funeral had long been over.  The child had
been put out to nurse, and Mr. Trelawny had so far recovered from the
shock of his loss that he had set himself to take up again the broken
threads of his life and his work.  That he had had a shock, and a bad
one, was apparent.  The sudden grey in his black hair was proof enough
in itself; but in addition, the strong cast of his features had become
set and stern.  Since he received that cable in the shipping office at
Alexandria I have never seen a happy smile on his face.

""Work is the best thing in such a case; and to his work he devoted
himself heart and soul.  The strange tragedy of his loss and gain--for
the child was born after the mother's death--took place during the time
that we stood in that trance in the Mummy Pit of Queen Tera.  It seemed
to have become in some way associated with his Egyptian studies, and
more especially with the mysteries connected with the Queen.  He told me
very little about his daughter; but that two forces struggled in his
mind regarding her was apparent.  I could see that he loved, almost
idolised her. Yet he could never forget that her birth had cost her
mother's life.  Also, there was something whose existence seemed to
wring his father's heart, though he would never tell me what it was.
Again, he once said in a moment of relaxation of his purpose of silence:

""'She is unlike her mother; but in both feature and colour she has a
marvellous resemblance to the pictures of Queen Tera.'

""He said that he had sent her away to people who would care for her as
he could not; and that till she became a woman she should have all the
simple pleasures that a young girl might have, and that were best for
her.  I would often have talked with him about her; but he would never
say much.  Once he said to me:  'There are reasons why I should not
speak more than is necessary.  Some day you will know--and understand!'
I respected his reticence; and beyond asking after her on my return
after a journey, I have never spoken of her again.  I had never seen her
till I did so in your presence.

""Well, when the treasures which we had--ah!--taken from the tomb had
been brought here, Mr. Trelawny arranged their disposition himself.  The
mummy, all except the severed hand, he placed in the great ironstone
sarcophagus in the hall.  This was wrought for the Theban High Priest
Uni, and is, as you may have remarked, all inscribed with wonderful
invocations to the old Gods of Egypt.  The rest of the things from the
tomb he disposed about his own room, as you have seen.  Amongst them he
placed, for special reasons of his own, the mummy hand.  I think he
regards this as the most sacred of his possessions, with perhaps one
exception.  That is the carven ruby which he calls the 'Jewel of Seven
Stars', which he keeps in that great safe which is locked and guarded by
various devices, as you know.

""I dare say you find this tedious; but I have had to explain it, so that
you should understand all up to the present.  It was a long time after
my return with the mummy of Queen Tera when Mr. Trelawny re-opened the
subject with me.  He had been several times to Egypt, sometimes with me
and sometimes alone; and I had been several trips, on my own account or
for him.  But in all that time, nearly sixteen years, he never mentioned
the subject, unless when some pressing occasion suggested, if it did not
necessitate, a reference.

""One morning early he sent for me in a hurry; I was then studying in the
British Museum, and had rooms in Hart Street.  When I came, he was all
on fire with excitement.  I had not seen him in such a glow since before
the news of his wife's death.  He took me at once into his room.  The
window blinds were down and the shutters closed; not a ray of daylight
came in.  The ordinary lights in the room were not lit, but there were a
lot of powerful electric lamps, fifty candle-power at least, arranged on
one side of the room.  The little bloodstone table on which the
heptagonal coffer stands was drawn to the centre of the room.  The
coffer looked exquisite in the glare of light which shone on it.  It
actually seemed to glow as if lit in some way from within.

""'What do you think of it?' he asked.

""'It is like a jewel,' I answered.  'You may well call it the
'sorcerer's Magic Coffer"", if it often looks like that.  It almost seems
to be alive.'

""'Do you know why it seems so?'

""'From the glare of the light, I suppose?'

""'Light of course,' he answered, 'but it is rather the disposition of
light.'  As he spoke he turned up the ordinary lights of the room and
switched off the special ones.  The effect on the stone box was
surprising; in a second it lost all its glowing effect.  It was still a
very beautiful stone, as always; but it was stone and no more.

""'Do you notice anything about the arrangement of the lamps?' he asked.

""'No!'

""'They were in the shape of the stars in the Plough, as the stars are in
the ruby!'  The statement came to me with a certain sense of conviction.
I do not know why, except that there had been so many mysterious
associations with the mummy and all belonging to it that any new one
seemed enlightening.  I listened as Trelawny went on to explain:

""'For sixteen years I have never ceased to think of that adventure, or
to try to find a clue to the mysteries which came before us; but never
until last night did I seem to find a solution.  I think I must have
dreamed of it, for I woke all on fire about it.  I jumped out of bed
with a determination of doing something, before I quite knew what it was
that I wished to do.  Then, all at once, the purpose was clear before
me. There were allusions in the writing on the walls of the tomb to the
seven stars of the Great Bear that go to make up the Plough; and the
North was again and again emphasized.  The same symbols were repeated
with regard to the ""Magic Box"", as we called it.  We had already noticed
those peculiar translucent spaces in the stone of the box.  You remember
the hieroglyphic writing had told that the jewel came from the heart of
an aerolite, and that the coffer was cut from it also.  It might be, I
thought, that the light of the seven stars, shining in the right
direction, might have some effect on the box, or something within it.  I
raised the blind and looked out. The Plough was high in the heavens, and
both its stars and the Pole Star were straight opposite the window.  I
pulled the table with the coffer out into the light, and shifted it
until the translucent patches were in the direction of the stars.
Instantly the box began to glow, as you saw it under the lamps, though
but slightly. I waited and waited; but the sky clouded over, and the
light died away.  So I got wires and lamps--you know how often I use them
in experiments--and tried the effect of electric light.  It took me some
time to get the lamps properly placed, so that they would correspond to
the parts of the stone, but the moment I got them right the whole thing
began to glow as you have seen it.

""'I could get no further, however.  There was evidently something
wanting.  All at once it came to me that if light could have some effect
there should be in the tomb some means of producing light, for there
could not be starlight in the Mummy Pit in the cavern.  Then the whole
thing seemed to become clear.  On the bloodstone table, which has a
hollow carved in its top, into which the bottom of the coffer fits, I
laid the Magic Coffer; and I at once saw that the odd protuberances so
carefully wrought in the substance of the stone corresponded in a way to
the stars in the constellation.  These, then, were to hold lights.

""'Eureka!' I cried.  'All we want now is the lamps.'""  I tried placing
the electric lights on, or close to, the protuberances.  But the glow
never came to the stone. So the conviction grew on me that there were
special lamps made for the purpose. If we could find them, a step on the
road to solving the mystery should be gained.

""'But what about the lamps?' I asked.  'Where are they?  When are we to
discover them?  How are we to know them if we do find them?  What--""

""He stopped me at once:

""'One thing at a time!' he said quietly.  'Your first question contains
all the rest. Where are these lamps?  I shall tell you:  In the tomb!'

""'In the tomb!' I repeated in surprise.  'Why you and I searched the
place ourselves from end to end; and there was not a sign of a lamp.
Not a sign of anything remaining when we came away the first time; or on
the second, except the bodies of the Arabs.'

""Whilst I was speaking, he had uncoiled some large sheets of paper which
he had brought in his hand from his own room.  These he spread out on
the great table, keeping their edges down with books and weights.  I
knew them at a glance; they were the careful copies which he had made of
our first transcripts from the writing in the tomb.  When he had all
ready, he turned to me and said slowly:

""'Do you remember wondering, when we examined the tomb, at the lack of
one thing which is usually found in such a tomb?'

""'Yes!  There was no serdab.'

""The Serdab, I may perhaps explain,"" said Mr. Corbeck to me, ""is a sort
of niche built or hewn in the wall of a tomb.  Those which have as yet
been examined bear no inscriptions, and contain only effigies of the
dead for whom the tomb was made."" Then he went on with his narrative:

""Trelawny, when he saw that I had caught his meaning, went on speaking
with something of his old enthusiasm:

""'I have come to the conclusion that there must be a serdab--a secret
one.  We were dull not to have thought of it before.  We might have
known that the maker of such a tomb--a woman, who had shown in other ways
such a sense of beauty and completeness, and who had finished every
detail with a feminine richness of elaboration--would not have neglected
such an architectural feature.  Even if it had not its own special
significance in ritual, she would have had it as an adornment. Others
had had it, and she liked her own work to be complete.  Depend upon it,
there was--there is--a serdab; and that in it, when it is discovered, we
shall find the lamps.  Of course, had we known then what we now know or
at all events surmise, that there were lamps, we might have suspected
some hidden spot, some cachet.  I am going to ask you to go out to Egypt
again; to seek the tomb; to find the serdab; and to bring back the
lamps!'""

""'And if I find there is no serdab; or if discovering it I find no lamps
in it, what then?' He smiled grimly with that saturnine smile of his, so
rarely seen for years past, as he spoke slowly:

""'Then you will have to hustle till you find them!'

""'Good!' I said.  He pointed to one of the sheets.

""'Here are the transcripts from the Chapel at the south and the east.  I
have been looking over the writings again; and I find that in seven
places round this corner are the symbols of the constellation which we
call the Plough, which Queen Tera held to rule her birth and her
destiny.  I have examined them carefully, and I notice that they are all
representations of the grouping of the stars, as the constellation
appears in different parts of the heavens.  They are all astronomically
correct; and as in the real sky the Pointers indicate the Pole Star, so
these all point to one spot in the wall where usually the serdab is to
be found!'

""'Bravo!' I shouted, for such a piece of reasoning demanded applause.
He seemed pleased as he went on:

""'When you are in the tomb, examine this spot.  There is probably some
spring or mechanical contrivance for opening the receptacle.  What it
may be, there is no use guessing.  You will know what best to do, when
you are on the spot.'

""I started the next week for Egypt; and never rested till I stood again
in the tomb.  I had found some of our old following; and was fairly well
provided with help.  The country was now in a condition very different
to that in which it had been sixteen years before; there was no need for
troops or armed men.

""I climbed the rock face alone.  There was no difficulty, for in that
fine climate the woodwork of the ladder was still dependable.  It was
easy to see that in the years that had elapsed there had been other
visitors to the tomb; and my heart sank within me when I thought that
some of them might by chance have come across the secret place.  It
would be a bitter discovery indeed to find that they had forestalled me;
and that my journey had been in vain.

""The bitterness was realised when I lit my torches, and passed between
the seven-sided columns to the Chapel of the tomb.

""There, in the very spot where I had expected to find it, was the
opening of a serdab. And the serdab was empty.

""But the Chapel was not empty; for the dried-up body of a man in Arab
dress lay close under the opening, as though he had been stricken down.
I examined all round the walls to see if Trelawny's surmise was correct;
and I found that in all the positions of the stars as given, the
Pointers of the Plough indicated a spot to the left hand, or south side,
of the opening of the serdab, where was a single star in gold.

""I pressed this, and it gave way.  The stone which had marked the front
of the serdab, and which lay back against the wall within, moved
slightly.  On further examining the other side of the opening, I found a
similar spot, indicated by other representations of the constellation;
but this was itself a figure of the seven stars, and each was wrought in
burnished gold.  I pressed each star in turn; but without result.  Then
it struck me that if the opening spring was on the left, this on the
right might have been intended for the simultaneous pressure of all the
stars by one hand of seven fingers.  By using both my hands, I managed
to effect this.

""With a loud click, a metal figure seemed to dart from close to the
opening of the serdab; the stone slowly swung back to its place, and
shut with a click.  The glimpse which I had of the descending figure
appalled me for the moment.  It was like that grim guardian which,
according to the Arabian historian Ibn Abd Alhokin, the builder of the
Pyramids, King Saurid Ibn Salhouk placed in the Western Pyramid to
defend its treasure:  'A marble figure, upright, with lance in hand;
with on his head a serpent wreathed.  When any approached, the serpent
would bite him on one side, and twining about his throat and killing
him, would return again to his place.'

""I knew well that such a figure was not wrought to pleasantry; and that
to brave it was no child's play.  The dead Arab at my feet was proof of
what could be done!  So I examined again along the wall; and found here
and there chippings as if someone had been tapping with a heavy hammer.
This then had been what happened:  The grave-robber, more expert at his
work than we had been, and suspecting the presence of a hidden serdab,
had made essay to find it.  He had struck the spring by chance; had
released the avenging 'Treasurer', as the Arabian writer designated him.
The issue spoke for itself.  I got a piece of wood, and, standing at a
safe distance, pressed with the end of it upon the star.

""Instantly the stone flew back.  The hidden figure within darted forward
and thrust out its lance.  Then it rose up and disappeared.  I thought I
might now safely press on the seven stars; and did so.  Again the stone
rolled back; and the 'Treasurer' flashed by to his hidden lair.

""I repeated both experiments several times; with always the same result.
I should have liked to examine the mechanism of that figure of such
malignant mobility; but it was not possible without such tools as could
not easily be had.  It might be necessary to cut into a whole section of
the rock.  Some day I hope to go back, properly equipped, and attempt
it.

""Perhaps you do not know that the entrance to a serdab is almost always
very narrow; sometimes a hand can hardly be inserted.  Two things I
learned from this serdab.  The first was that the lamps, if lamps at all
there had been, could not have been of large size; and secondly, that
they would be in some way associated with Hathor, whose symbol, the hawk
in a square with the right top corner forming a smaller square, was cut
in relief on the wall within, and coloured the bright vermilion which we
had found on the Stele.  Hathor is the goddess who in Egyptian mythology
answers to Venus of the Greeks, in as far as she is the presiding deity
of beauty and pleasure.  In the Egyptian mythology, however, each God
has many forms; and in some aspects Hathor has to do with the idea of
resurrection.  There are seven forms or variants of the Goddess; why
should not these correspond in some way to the seven lamps!  That there
had been such lamps, I was convinced.  The first grave-robber had met
his death; the second had found the contents of the serdab.  The first
attempt had been made years since; the state of the body proved this.  I
had no clue to the second attempt.  It might have been long ago; or it
might have been recently.  If, however, others had been to the tomb, it
was probable that the lamps had been taken long ago.  Well! all the more
difficult would be my search; for undertaken it must be!

""That was nearly three years ago; and for all that time I have been like
the man in the Arabian Nights, seeking old lamps, not for new, but for
cash.  I dared not say what I was looking for, or attempt to give any
description; for such would have defeated my purpose.  But I had in my
own mind at the start a vague idea of what I must find.  In process of
time this grew more and more clear; till at last I almost overshot my
mark by searching for something which might have been wrong.

""The disappointments I suffered, and the wild-goose chases I made, would
fill a volume; but I persevered.  At last, not two months ago, I was
shown by an old dealer in Mossul one lamp such as I had looked for.  I
had been tracing it for nearly a year, always suffering disappointment,
but always buoyed up to further endeavour by a growing hope that I was
on the track.

""I do not know how I restrained myself when I realised that, at last, I
was at least close to success.  I was skilled, however, in the finesse
of Eastern trade; and the Jew-Arab-Portugee trader met his match.  I
wanted to see all his stock before buying; and one by one he produced,
amongst masses of rubbish, seven different lamps.  Each of them had a
distinguishing mark; and each and all was some form of the symbol of
Hathor.  I think I shook the imperturbability of my swarthy friend by
the magnitude of my purchases; for in order to prevent him guessing what
form of goods I sought, I nearly cleared out his shop.  At the end he
nearly wept, and said I had ruined him; for now he had nothing to sell.
He would have torn his hair had he known what price I should ultimately
have given for some of his stock, that perhaps he valued least.

""I parted with most of my merchandise at normal price as I hurried home.
I did not dare to give it away, or even lose it, lest I should incur
suspicion.  My burden was far too precious to be risked by any
foolishness now.  I got on as fast as it is possible to travel in such
countries; and arrived in London with only the lamps and certain
portable curios and papyri which I had picked up on my travels.

""Now, Mr. Ross, you know all I know; and I leave it to your discretion
how much, if any of it, you will tell Miss Trelawny.""

As he finished a clear young voice said behind us:

""What about Miss Trelawny?  She is here!""

We turned, startled; and looked at each other inquiringly.  Miss
Trelawny stood in the doorway.  We did not know how long she had been
present, or how much she had heard.





Chapter XIII
Awaking From the Trance

The first unexpected words may always startle a hearer; but when the
shock is over, the listener's reason has asserted itself, and he can
judge of the manner, as well as of the matter, of speech.  Thus it was
on this occasion.  With intelligence now alert, I could not doubt of the
simple sincerity of Margaret's next question.

""What have you two men been talking about all this time, Mr. Ross?  I
suppose, Mr. Corbeck has been telling you all his adventures in finding
the lamps.  I hope you will tell me too, some day, Mr. Corbeck; but that
must not be till my poor Father is better.  He would like, I am sure, to
tell me all about these things himself; or to be present when I heard
them.""  She glanced sharply from one to the other.  ""Oh, that was what
you were saying as I came in?  All right!  I shall wait; but I hope it
won't be long.  The continuance of Father's condition is, I feel,
breaking me down.  A little while ago I felt that my nerves were giving
out; so I determined to go out for a walk in the Park.  I am sure it
will do me good.  I want you, if you will, Mr. Ross, to be with Father
whilst I am away.  I shall feel secure then.""

I rose with alacrity, rejoicing that the poor girl was going out, even
for half an hour. She was looking terribly wearied and haggard; and the
sight of her pale cheeks made my heart ache.  I went to the sick-room;
and sat down in my usual place.  Mrs. Grant was then on duty; we had not
found it necessary to have more than one person in the room during the
day.  When I came in, she took occasion to go about some household duty.
The blinds were up, but the north aspect of the room softened the hot
glare of the sunlight without.

I sat for a long time thinking over all that Mr. Corbeck had told me;
and weaving its wonders into the tissue of strange things which had come
to pass since I had entered the house.  At times I was inclined to
doubt; to doubt everything and every one; to doubt even the evidences of
my own five senses.  The warnings of the skilled detective kept coming
back to my mind.  He had put down Mr. Corbeck as a clever liar, and a
confederate of Miss Trelawny.  Of Margaret!  That settled it!  Face to
face with such a proposition as that, doubt vanished.  Each time when
her image, her name, the merest thought of her, came before my mind,
each event stood out stark as a living fact.  My life upon her faith!

I was recalled from my reverie, which was fast becoming a dream of love,
in a startling manner.  A voice came from the bed; a deep, strong,
masterful voice.  The first note of it called up like a clarion my eyes
and my ears.  The sick man was awake and speaking!

""Who are you?  What are you doing here?""

Whatever ideas any of us had ever formed of his waking, I am quite sure
that none of us expected to see him start up all awake and full master
of himself.  I was so surprised that I answered almost mechanically:

""Ross is my name.  I have been watching by you!""  He looked surprised
for an instant, and then I could see that his habit of judging for
himself came into play.

""Watching by me!  How do you mean?  Why watching by me?""  His eye had
now lit on his heavily bandaged wrist.  He went on in a different tone;
less aggressive, more genial, as of one accepting facts:

""Are you a doctor?""  I felt myself almost smiling as I answered; the
relief from the long pressure of anxiety regarding his life was
beginning to tell:

""No, sir!""

""Then why are you here?  If you are not a doctor, what are you?""  His
tone was again more dictatorial.  Thought is quick; the whole train of
reasoning on which my answer must be based flooded through my brain
before the words could leave my lips. Margaret!  I must think of
Margaret!  This was her father, who as yet knew nothing of me; even of
my very existence.  He would be naturally curious, if not anxious, to
know why I amongst men had been chosen as his daughter's friend on the
occasion of his illness.  Fathers are naturally a little jealous in such
matters as a daughter's choice, and in the undeclared state of my love
for Margaret I must do nothing which could ultimately embarrass her.

""I am a Barrister.  It is not, however, in that capacity I am here; but
simply as a friend of your daughter.  It was probably her knowledge of
my being a lawyer which first determined her to ask me to come when she
thought you had been murdered. Afterwards she was good enough to
consider me to be a friend, and to allow me to remain in accordance with
your expressed wish that someone should remain to watch.""

Mr. Trelawny was manifestly a man of quick thought, and of few words.
He gazed at me keenly as I spoke, and his piercing eyes seemed to read
my thought.  To my relief he said no more on the subject just then,
seeming to accept my words in simple faith. There was evidently in his
own mind some cause for the acceptance deeper than my own knowledge.
His eyes flashed, and there was an unconscious movement of the mouth--it
could hardly be called a twitch--which betokened satisfaction.  He was
following out some train of reasoning in his own mind.  Suddenly he
said:

""She thought I had been murdered!  Was that last night?""

""No! four days ago.""  He seemed surprised.  Whilst he had been speaking
the first time he had sat up in bed; now he made a movement as though he
would jump out. With an effort, however, he restrained himself; leaning
back on his pillows he said quietly:

""Tell me all about it!  All you know!  Every detail!  Omit nothing!  But
stay; first lock the door!  I want to know, before I see anyone, exactly
how things stand.""

Somehow his last words made my heart leap.  ""Anyone!""  He evidently
accepted me, then, as an exception.  In my present state of feeling for
his daughter, this was a comforting thought.  I felt exultant as I went
over to the door and softly turned the key.  When I came back I found
him sitting up again.  He said:

""Go on!""

Accordingly, I told him every detail, even of the slightest which I
could remember, of what had happened from the moment of my arrival at
the house.  Of course I said nothing of my feeling towards Margaret, and
spoke only concerning those things already within his own knowledge.
With regard to Corbeck, I simply said that he had brought back some
lamps of which he had been in quest.  Then I proceeded to tell him fully
of their loss, and of their re-discovery in the house.

He listened with a self-control which, under the circumstances, was to
me little less than marvellous.  It was impassiveness, for at times his
eyes would flash or blaze, and the strong fingers of his uninjured hand
would grip the sheet, pulling it into far-extending wrinkles.  This was
most noticeable when I told him of the return of Corbeck, and the
finding of the lamps in the boudoir.  At times he spoke, but only a few
words, and as if unconsciously in emotional comment.  The mysterious
parts, those which had most puzzled us, seemed to have no special
interest for him; he seemed to know them already.  The utmost concern he
showed was when I told him of Daw's shooting.  His muttered comment:
'stupid ass!"" together with a quick glance across the room at the
injured cabinet, marked the measure of his disgust.  As I told him of
his daughter's harrowing anxiety for him, of her unending care and
devotion, of the tender love which she had shown, he seemed much moved.
There was a sort of veiled surprise in his unconscious whisper:

""Margaret!  Margaret!""

When I had finished my narration, bringing matters up to the moment when
Miss Trelawny had gone out for her walk--I thought of her as ""Miss
Trelawny', not as ""Margaret' now, in the presence of her father--he
remained silent for quite a long time.  It was probably two or three
minutes; but it seemed interminable.  All at once he turned and said to
me briskly:

""Now tell me all about yourself!""  This was something of a floorer; I
felt myself grow red-hot.  Mr. Trelawny's eyes were upon me; they were
now calm and inquiring, but never ceasing in their soul-searching
scrutiny.  There was just a suspicion of a smile on the mouth which,
though it added to my embarrassment, gave me a certain measure of
relief.  I was, however, face to face with difficulty; and the habit of
my life stood me in good stead.  I looked him straight in the eyes as I
spoke:

""My name, as I told you, is Ross, Malcolm Ross.  I am by profession a
Barrister.  I was made a Q.C. in the last year of the Queen's reign.  I
have been fairly successful in my work.""  To my relief he said:

""Yes, I know.  I have always heard well of you!  Where and when did you
meet Margaret?""

""First at the Hay's in Belgrave Square, ten days ago.  Then at a picnic
up the river with Lady Strathconnell.  We went from Windsor to Cookham.
Mar--Miss Trelawny was in my boat.  I scull a little, and I had my own
boat at Windsor.  We had a good deal of conversation--naturally.""

""Naturally!"" there was just a suspicion of something sardonic in the
tone of acquiescence; but there was no other intimation of his feeling.
I began to think that as I was in the presence of a strong man, I should
show something of my own strength.  My friends, and sometimes my
opponents, say that I am a strong man.  In my present circumstances, not
to be absolutely truthful would be to be weak.  So I stood up to the
difficulty before me; always bearing in mind, however, that my words
might affect Margaret's happiness through her love for her father.  I
went on:

""In conversation at a place and time and amid surroundings so pleasing,
and in a solitude inviting to confidence, I got a glimpse of her inner
life.  Such a glimpse as a man of my years and experience may get from a
young girl!""  The father's face grew graver as I went on; but he said
nothing.  I was committed now to a definite line of speech, and went on
with such mastery of my mind as I could exercise.  The occasion might be
fraught with serious consequences to me too.

""I could not but see that there was over her spirit a sense of
loneliness which was habitual to her.  I thought I understood it; I am
myself an only child.  I ventured to encourage her to speak to me
freely; and was happy enough to succeed.  A sort of confidence became
established between us.""  There was something in the father's face which
made me add hurriedly:

""Nothing was said by her, sir, as you can well imagine, which was not
right and proper.  She only told me in the impulsive way of one longing
to give voice to thoughts long carefully concealed, of her yearning to
be closer to the father whom she loved; more en rapport with him; more
in his confidence; closer within the circle of his sympathies.  Oh,
believe me, sir, that it was all good!  All that a father's heart could
hope or wish for!  It was all loyal!  That she spoke it to me was
perhaps because I was almost a stranger with whom there was no previous
barrier to confidence.""

Here I paused.  It was hard to go on; and I feared lest I might, in my
zeal, do Margaret a disservice.  The relief of the strain came from her
father.

""And you?""

""Sir, Miss Trelawny is very sweet and beautiful!  She is young; and her
mind is like crystal!  Her sympathy is a joy!  I am not an old man, and
my affections were not engaged.  They never had been till then.  I hope
I may say as much, even to a father!"" My eyes involuntarily dropped.
When I raised them again Mr. Trelawny was still gazing at me keenly.
All the kindliness of his nature seemed to wreath itself in a smile as
he held out his hand and said:

""Malcolm Ross, I have always heard of you as a fearless and honourable
gentleman. I am glad my girl has such a friend!  Go on!""

My heart leaped.  The first step to the winning of Margaret's father was
gained.  I dare say I was somewhat more effusive in my words and my
manner as I went on.  I certainly felt that way.

""One thing we gain as we grow older:  to use our age judiciously!  I
have had much experience.  I have fought for it and worked for it all my
life; and I felt that I was justified in using it.  I ventured to ask
Miss Trelawny to count on me as a friend; to let me serve her should
occasion arise.  She promised me that she would.  I had little idea that
my chance of serving her should come so soon or in such a way; but that
very night you were stricken down.  In her desolation and anxiety she
sent for me!"" I paused.  He continued to look at me as I went on:

""When your letter of instructions was found, I offered my services.
They were accepted, as you know.""

""And these days, how did they pass for you?""  The question startled me.
There was in it something of Margaret's own voice and manner; something
so greatly resembling her lighter moments that it brought out all the
masculinity in me.  I felt more sure of my ground now as I said:

""These days, sir, despite all their harrowing anxiety, despite all the
pain they held for the girl whom I grew to love more and more with each
passing hour, have been the happiest of my life!""  He kept silence for a
long time; so long that, as I waited for him to speak, with my heart
beating, I began to wonder if my frankness had been too effusive.  At
last he said:

""I suppose it is hard to say so much vicariously.  Her poor mother
should have heard you; it would have made her heart glad!""  Then a
shadow swept across his face; and he went on more hurriedly.

""But are you quite sure of all this?""

""I know my own heart, sir; or, at least, I think I do!""

""No! no!"" he answered, ""I don't mean you.  That is all right!  But you
spoke of my girl's affection for me . . . and yet . . . !  And yet she
has been living here, in my house, a whole year. . . Still, she spoke
to you of her loneliness--her desolation.  I never--it grieves me to say
it, but it is true--I never saw sign of such affection towards myself in
all the year! . . .""  His voice trembled away into sad, reminiscent
introspection.

""Then, sir,"" I said, ""I have been privileged to see more in a few days
than you in her whole lifetime!""  My words seemed to call him up from
himself; and I thought that it was with pleasure as well as surprise
that he said:

""I had no idea of it.  I thought that she was indifferent to me.  That
what seemed like the neglect of her youth was revenging itself on me.
That she was cold of heart. . . . It is a joy unspeakable to me that her
mother's daughter loves me too!"" Unconsciously he sank back upon his
pillow, lost in memories of the past.

How he must have loved her mother!  It was the love of her mother's
child, rather than the love of his own daughter, that appealed to him.
My heart went out to him in a great wave of sympathy and kindliness.  I
began to understand.  To understand the passion of these two great,
silent, reserved natures, that successfully concealed the burning hunger
for the other's love!  It did not surprise me when presently he murmured
to himself:

""Margaret, my child!  Tender, and thoughtful, and strong, and true, and
brave!  Like her dear mother! like her dear mother!""

And then to the very depths of my heart I rejoiced that I had spoken so
frankly.

Presently Mr. Trelawny said:

""Four days!  The sixteenth!  Then this is the twentieth of July?""  I
nodded affirmation; he went on:

""So I have been lying in a trance for four days.  It is not the first
time.  I was in a trance once under strange conditions for three days;
and never even suspected it till I was told of the lapse of time.  I
shall tell you all about it some day, if you care to hear.""

That made me thrill with pleasure.  That he, Margaret's father, would so
take me into his confidence made it possible. . . .The business-like,
every-day alertness of his voice as he spoke next quite recalled me:

""I had better get up now.  When Margaret comes in, tell her yourself
that I am all right.  It will avoid any shock!  And will you tell
Corbeck that I would like to see him as soon as I can.  I want to see
those lamps, and hear all about them!""

His attitude towards me filled me with delight.  There was a possible
father-in-law aspect that would have raised me from a death-bed.  I was
hurrying away to carry out his wishes; when, however, my hand was on the
key of the door, his voice recalled me:

""Mr. Ross!""

I did not like to hear him say ""Mr.""  After he knew of my friendship
with his daughter he had called me Malcolm Ross; and this obvious return
to formality not only pained, but filled me with apprehension.  It must
be something about Margaret.  I thought of her as ""Margaret"" and not as
""Miss Trelawny"", now that there was danger of losing her. I know now
what I felt then:  that I was determined to fight for her rather than
lose her.  I came back, unconsciously holding myself erect.  Mr.
Trelawny, the keen observer of men, seemed to read my thought; his face,
which was set in a new anxiety, relaxed as he said:

""Sit down a minute; it is better that we speak now than later.  We are
both men, and men of the world.  All this about my daughter is very new
to me, and very sudden; and I want to know exactly how and where I
stand.  Mind, I am making no objection; but as a father I have duties
which are grave, and may prove to be painful.  I--I""--he seemed slightly
at a loss how to begin, and this gave me hope--""I suppose I am to take
it, from what you have said to me of your feelings towards my girl, that
it is in your mind to be a suitor for her hand, later on?""  I answered
at once:

""Absolutely!  Firm and fixed; it was my intention the evening after I
had been with her on the river, to seek you, of course after a proper
and respectful interval, and to ask you if I might approach her on the
subject.  Events forced me into closer relationship more quickly than I
had to hope would be possible; but that first purpose has remained fresh
in my heart, and has grown in intensity, and multiplied itself with
every hour which has passed since then.""  His face seemed to soften as
he looked at me; the memory of his own youth was coming back to him
instinctively.  After a pause he said:

""I suppose I may take it, too, Malcolm Ross""--the return to the
familiarity of address swept through me with a glorious thrill--""that as
yet you have not made any protestation to my daughter?""

""Not in words, sir.""  The arriere pensee of my phrase struck me, not by
its own humour, but through the grave, kindly smile on the father's
face.  There was a pleasant sarcasm in his comment:

""Not in words!  That is dangerous!  She might have doubted words, or
even disbelieved them.""

""I felt myself blushing to the roots of my hair as I went on:

""The duty of delicacy in her defenceless position; my respect for her
father--I did not know you then, sir, as yourself, but only as her
father--restrained me.  But even had not these barriers existed, I should
not have dared in the presence of such grief and anxiety to have
declared myself.  Mr. Trelawny, I assure you on my word of honour that
your daughter and I are as yet, on her part, but friends and nothing
more!""  Once again he held out his hands, and we clasped each other
warmly.  Then he said heartily:

""I am satisfied, Malcolm Ross.  Of course, I take it that until I have
seen her and have given you permission, you will not make any
declaration to my daughter--in words,"" he added, with an indulgent smile.
But his face became stern again as he went on:

""Time presses; and I have to think of some matters so urgent and so
strange that I dare not lose an hour.  Otherwise I should not have been
prepared to enter, at so short a notice and to so new a friend, on the
subject of my daughter's settlement in life, and of her future
happiness.""  There was a dignity and a certain proudness in his manner
which impressed me much.

""I shall respect your wishes, sir!"" I said as I went back and opened the
door.  I heard him lock it behind me.

When I told Mr. Corbeck that Mr. Trelawny had quite recovered, he began
to dance about like a wild man.  But he suddenly stopped, and asked me
to be careful not to draw any inferences, at all events at first, when
in the future speaking of the finding of the lamps, or of the first
visits to the tomb.  This was in case Mr. Trelawny should speak to me on
the subject; ""as, of course, he will,"" he added, with a sidelong look at
me which meant knowledge of the affairs of my heart.  I agreed to this,
feeling that it was quite right.  I did not quite understand why; but I
knew that Mr. Trelawny was a peculiar man.  In no case could one make a
mistake by being reticent. Reticence is a quality which a strong man
always respects.

The manner in which the others of the house took the news of the
recovery varied much.  Mrs. Grant wept with emotion; then she hurried
off to see if she could do anything personally, and to set the house in
order for ""Master"", as she always called him.  The Nurse's face fell:
she was deprived of an interesting case.  But the disappointment was
only momentary; and she rejoiced that the trouble was over. She was
ready to come to the patient the moment she should be wanted; but in the
meantime she occupied herself in packing her portmanteau.

I took Sergeant Daw into the study, so that we should be alone when I
told him the news.  It surprised even his iron self-control when I told
him the method of the waking.  I was myself surprised in turn by his
first words:

""And how did he explain the first attack?  He was unconscious when the
second was made.""

Up to that moment the nature of the attack, which was the cause of my
coming to the house, had never even crossed my mind, except when I had
simply narrated the various occurrences in sequence to Mr. Trelawny.
The Detective did not seem to think much of my answer:

""Do you know, it never occurred to me to ask him!""  The professional
instinct was strong in the man, and seemed to supersede everything else.

""That is why so few cases are ever followed out,"" he said, ""unless our
people are in them.  Your amateur detective neer hunts down to the
death.  As for ordinary people, the moment things begin to mend, and the
strain of suspense is off them, they drop the matter in hand.  It is
like sea-sickness,"" he added philosophically after a pause; ""the moment
you touch the shore you never give it a thought, but run off to the
buffet to feed!  Well, Mr. Ross, I'm glad the case is over; for over it
is, so far as I am concerned.  I suppose that Mr. Trelawny knows his own
business; and that now he is well again, he will take it up himself.
Perhaps, however, he will not do anything. As he seemed to expect
something to happen, but did not ask for protection from the police in
any way, I take it that he don't want them to interfere with an eye to
punishment.  we'll be told officially, I suppose, that it was an
accident, or sleep-walking, or something of the kind, to satisfy the
conscience of our Record Department; and that will be the end.  As for
me, I tell you frankly, sir, that it will be the saving of me.  I verily
believe I was beginning to get dotty over it all.  There were too many
mysteries, that aren't in my line, for me to be really satisfied as to
either facts or the causes of them.  Now I'll be able to wash my hands
of it, and get back to clean, wholesome, criminal work.  Of course, sir,
I'll be glad to know if you ever do light on a cause of any kind.  And
I'll be grateful if you can ever tell me how the man was dragged out of
bed when the cat bit him, and who used the knife the second time.  For
master Silvio could never have done it by himself.  But there! I keep
thinking of it still.  I must look out and keep a check on myself, or I
shall think of it when I have to keep my mind on other things!""

When Margaret returned from her walk, I met her in the hall.  She was
still pale and sad; somehow, I had expected to see her radiant after her
walk.  The moment she saw me her eyes brightened, and she looked at me
keenly.

""You have some good news for me?"" she said.  ""Is Father better?""

""He is!  Why did you think so?""

""I saw it in your face.  I must go to him at once.""  She was hurrying
away when I stopped her.

""He said he would send for you the moment he was dressed.""

""He said he would send for me!"" she repeated in amazement.  ""Then he is
awake again, and conscious?  I had no idea he was so well as that! O
Malcolm!""

She sat down on the nearest chair and began to cry.  I felt overcome
myself.  The sight of her joy and emotion, the mention of my own name in
such a way and at such a time, the rush of glorious possibilities all
coming together, quite unmanned me.  She saw my emotion, and seemed to
understand.  She put out her hand.  I held it hard, and kissed it.  Such
moments as these, the opportunities of lovers, are gifts of the gods! Up
to this instant, though I knew I loved her, and though I believed she
returned my affection, I had had only hope.  Now, however, the
self-surrender manifest in her willingness to let me squeeze her hand,
the ardour of her pressure in return, and the glorious flush of love in
her beautiful, deep, dark eyes as she lifted them to mine, were all the
eloquences which the most impatient or exacting lover could expect or
demand.

No word was spoken; none was needed.  Even had I not been pledged to
verbal silence, words would have been poor and dull to express what we
felt.  Hand in hand, like two little children, we went up the staircase
and waited on the landing, till the summons from Mr. Trelawny should
come.

I whispered in her ear--it was nicer than speaking aloud and at a greater
distance--how her father had awakened, and what he had said; and all
that had passed between us, except when she herself had been the subject
of conversation.

Presently a bell rang from the room.  Margaret slipped from me, and
looked back with warning finger on lip.  She went over to her father's
door and knocked softly.

""Come in!"" said the strong voice.

""It is I, Father!""  The voice was tremulous with love and hope.

There was a quick step inside the room; the door was hurriedly thrown
open, and in an instant Margaret, who had sprung forward, was clasped in
her father's arms. There was little speech; only a few broken phrases.

""Father!  Dear, dear Father!""

""My child!  Margaret!  My dear, dear child!""

""O Father, Father!  At last!  At last!""

Here the father and daughter went into the room together, and the door
closed.





Chapter XIV
The Birth-Mark

During my waiting for the summons to Mr. Trelawny's room, which I knew
would come, the time was long and lonely.  After the first few moments
of emotional happiness at Margaret's joy, I somehow felt apart and
alone; and for a little time the selfishness of a lover possessed me.
But it was not for long.  Margaret's happiness was all to me; and in the
conscious sense of it I lost my baser self.  Margaret's last words as
the door closed on them gave the key to the whole situation, as it had
been and as it was.  These two proud, strong people, though father and
daughter, had only come to know each other when the girl was grown up.
Margaret's nature was of that kind which matures early.

The pride and strength of each, and the reticence which was their
corollary, made a barrier at the beginning.  Each had respected the
other's reticence too much thereafter; and the misunderstanding grew to
habit.  And so these two loving hearts, each of which yearned for
sympathy from the other, were kept apart.  But now all was well, and in
my heart of hearts I rejoiced that at last Margaret was happy.  Whilst I
was still musing on the subject, and dreaming dreams of a personal
nature, the door was opened, and Mr. Trelawny beckoned to me.

""Come in, Mr. Ross!"" he said cordially, but with a certain formality
which I dreaded.  I entered the room, and he closed the door again.  He
held out his hand, and I put mine in it.  He did not let it go, but
still held it as he drew me over toward his daughter.  Margaret looked
from me to him, and back again; and her eyes fell.  When I was close to
her, Mr. Trelawny let go my hand, and, looking his daughter straight in
the face, said:

""If things are as I fancy, we shall not have any secrets between us.
Malcolm Ross knows so much of my affairs already, that I take it he must
either let matters stop where they are and go away in silence, or else
he must know more.  Margaret! are you willing to let Mr. Ross see your
wrist?""

She threw one swift look of appeal in his eyes; but even as she did so
she seemed to make up her mind.  Without a word she raised her right
hand, so that the bracelet of spreading wings which covered the wrist
fell back, leaving the flesh bare.  Then an icy chill shot through me.

On her wrist was a thin red jagged line, from which seemed to hang red
stains like drops of blood!

She stood there, a veritable figure of patient pride.

Oh! but she looked proud!  Through all her sweetness, all her dignity,
all her high-souled negation of self which I had known, and which never
seemed more marked than now--through all the fire that seemed to shine
from the dark depths of her eyes into my very soul, pride shone
conspicuously.  The pride that has faith; the pride that is born of
conscious purity; the pride of a veritable queen of Old Time, when to be
royal was to be the first and greatest and bravest in all high things.
As we stood thus for some seconds, the deep, grave voice of her father
seemed to sound a challenge in my ears:

""What do you say now?""

My answer was not in words.  I caught Margaret's right hand in mine as
it fell, and, holding it tight, whilst with the other I pushed back the
golden cincture, stooped and kissed the wrist.  As I looked up at her,
but never letting go her hand, there was a look of joy on her face such
as I dream of when I think of heaven.  Then I faced her father.

""You have my answer, sir!""  His strong face looked gravely sweet.  He
only said one word as he laid his hand on our clasped ones, whilst he
bent over and kissed his daughter:

""Good!""

We were interrupted by a knock at the door.  In answer to an impatient
""Come in!"" from Mr. Trelawny, Mr. Corbeck entered.  When he saw us
grouped he would have drawn back; but in an instant Mr. Trelawny had
sprung forth and dragged him forward.  As he shook him by both hands, he
seemed a transformed man.  All the enthusiasm of his youth, of which Mr.
Corbeck had told us, seemed to have come back to him in an instant.

""So you have got the lamps!"" he almost shouted.  ""My reasoning was right
after all. Come to the library, where we will be alone, and tell me all
about it!  And while he does it, Ross,"" said he, turning to me, ""do you,
like a good fellow, get the key from the safe deposit, so that I may
have a look at the lamps!""

Then the three of them, the daughter lovingly holding her father's arm,
went into the library, whilst I hurried off to Chancery Lane.

When I returned with the key, I found them still engaged in the
narrative; but Doctor Winchester, who had arrived soon after I left, was
with them.  Mr. Trelawny, on hearing from Margaret of his great
attention and kindness, and how he had, under much pressure to the
contrary, steadfastly obeyed his written wishes, had asked him to remain
and listen.  ""It will interest you, perhaps,"" he said, ""to learn the end
of the story!""

We all had an early dinner together.  We sat after it a good while, and
then Mr. Trelawny said:

""Now, I think we had all better separate and go quietly to bed early.
We may have much to talk about tomorrow; and tonight I want to think.""

Doctor Winchester went away, taking, with a courteous forethought, Mr.
Corbeck with him, and leaving me behind.  When the others had gone Mr.
Trelawny said:

""I think it will be well if you, too, will go home for tonight.  I want
to be quite alone with my daughter; there are many things I wish to
speak of to her, and to her alone. Perhaps, even tomorrow, I will be
able to tell you also of them; but in the meantime there will be less
distraction to us both if we are alone in the house.""  I quite
understood and sympathised with his feelings; but the experiences of the
last few days were strong on me, and with some hesitation I said:

""But may it not be dangerous?  If you knew as we do--""  To my surprise
Margaret interrupted me:

""There will be no danger, Malcolm.  I shall be with Father!""  As she
spoke she clung to him in a protective way.  I said no more, but stood
up to go at once.  Mr. Trelawny said heartily:

""Come as early as you please, Ross.  Come to breakfast.  After it, you
and I will want to have a word together.""  He went out of the room
quietly, leaving us together.  I clasped and kissed Margaret's hands,
which she held out to me, and then drew her close to me, and our lips
met for the first time.

I did not sleep much that night.  Happiness on the one side of my bed
and Anxiety on the other kept sleep away.  But if I had anxious care, I
had also happiness which had not equal in my life--or ever can have.  The
night went by so quickly that the dawn seemed to rush on me, not
stealing as is its wont.

Before nine o'clock I was at Kensington.  All anxiety seemed to float
away like a cloud as I met Margaret, and saw that already the pallor of
her face had given to the rich bloom which I knew.  She told me that her
father had slept well, and that he would be with us soon.

""I do believe,"" she whispered, ""that my dear and thoughtful Father has
kept back on purpose, so that I might meet you first, and alone!""

After breakfast Mr. Trelawny took us into the study, saying as he passed
in:

""I have asked Margaret to come too.""  When we were seated, he said
gravely:

""I told you last night that we might have something to say to each
other.  I dare say that you may have thought that it was about Margaret
and yourself.  Isn't that so?""

""I thought so.""

""Well, my boy, that is all right.  Margaret and I have been talking, and
I know her wishes.""  He held out his hand.  When I wrung it, and had
kissed Margaret, who drew her chair close to mine, so that we could hold
hands as we listened, he went on, but with a certain hesitation--it could
hardly be called nervousness--which was new to me.

""You know a good deal of my hunt after this mummy and her belongings;
and I dare say you have guessed a good deal of my theories.  But these
at any rate I shall explain later, concisely and categorically, if it be
necessary.  What I want to consult you about now is this:  Margaret and
I disagree on one point.  I am about to make an experiment; the
experiment which is to crown all that I have devoted twenty years of
research, and danger, and labour to prepare for.  Through it we may
learn things that have been hidden from the eyes and the knowledge of
men for centuries; for scores of centuries.  I do not want my daughter
to be present; for I cannot blind myself to the fact that there may be
danger in it--great danger, and of an unknown kind.  I have, however,
already faced very great dangers, and of an unknown kind; and so has
that brave scholar who has helped me in the work.  As to myself, I am
willing to run any risk.  For science, and history, and philosophy may
benefit; and we may turn one old page of a wisdom unknown in this
prosaic age.  But for my daughter to run such a risk I am loth.  Her
young bright life is too precious to throw lightly away; now especially
when she is on the very threshold of new happiness.  I do not wish to
see her life given, as her dear mother's was--""

He broke down for a moment, and covered his eyes with his hands.  In an
instant Margaret was beside him, clasping him close, and kissing him,
and comforting him with loving words.  Then, standing erect, with one
hand on his head, she said:

""Father! mother did not bid you stay beside her, even when you wanted to
go on that journey of unknown danger to Egypt; though that country was
then upset from end to end with war and the dangers that follow war.
You have told me how she left you free to go as you wished; though that
she thought of danger for you and and feared it for you, is proved by
this!""  She held up her wrist with the scar that seemed to run blood.
""Now, mother's daughter does as mother would have done herself!""  Then
she turned to me:

""Malcolm, you know I love you!  But love is trust; and you must trust me
in danger as well as in joy.  You and I must stand beside Father in this
unknown peril. Together we shall come through it; or together we shall
fail; together we shall die. That is my wish; my first wish to my
husband that is to be!  Do you not think that, as a daughter, I am
right?  Tell my Father what you think!""

She looked like a Queen stooping to plead.  My love for her grew and
grew.  I stood up beside her; and took her hand and said:

""Mr. Trelawny! in this Margaret and I are one!""

He took both our hands and held them hard.  Presently he said with deep
emotion:

""It is as her mother would have done!""

Mr. Corbeck and Doctor Winchester came exactly at the time appointed,
and joined us in the library.  Despite my great happiness I felt our
meeting to be a very solemn function.  For I could never forget the
strange things that had been; and the idea of the strange things which
might be, was with me like a cloud, pressing down on us all.  From the
gravity of my companions I gathered that each of them also was ruled by
some such dominating thought.

Instinctively we gathered our chairs into a circle round Mr. Trelawny,
who had taken the great armchair near the window.  Margaret sat by him
on his right, and I was next to her.  Mr. Corbeck was on his left, with
Doctor Winchester on the other side. After a few seconds of silence Mr.
Trelawny said to Mr. Corbeck:

""You have told Doctor Winchester all up to the present, as we arranged?

""Yes,"" he answered; so Mr. Trelawny said:

""And I have told Margaret, so we all know!""  Then, turning to the
Doctor, he asked:

""And am I to take it that you, knowing all as we know it who have
followed the matter for years, wish to share in the experiment which we
hope to make?""  His answer was direct and uncompromising:

""Certainly!  Why, when this matter was fresh to me, I offered to go on
with it to the end.  Now that it is of such strange interest, I would
not miss it for anything which you could name.  Be quite easy in your
mind, Mr. Trelawny.  I am a scientist and an investigator of phenomena.
I have no one belonging to me or dependent on me.  I am quite alone, and
free to do what I like with my own--including my life!""  Mr. Trelawny
bowed gravely, and turning to Mr. Corbeck said:

""I have known your ideas for many years past, old friend; so I need ask
you nothing. As to Margaret and Malcolm Ross, they have already told me
their wishes in no uncertain way.""  He paused a few seconds, as though
to put his thoughts or his words in order; then he began to explain his
views and intentions.  He spoke very carefully, seeming always to bear
in mind that some of us who listened were ignorant of the very root and
nature of some things touched upon, and explaining them to us as he went
on:

""The experiment which is before us is to try whether or no there is any
force, any reality, in the old Magic.  There could not possibly be more
favourable conditions for the test; and it is my own desire to do all
that is possible to make the original design effective.  That there is
some such existing power I firmly believe.  It might not be possible to
create, or arrange, or organise such a power in our own time; but I take
it that if in Old Time such a power existed, it may have some
exceptional survival.  After all, the Bible is not a myth; and we read
there that the sun stood still at a man's command, and that an ass--not
a human one--spoke.  And if the Witch at Endor could call up to Saul the
spirit of Samuel, why may not there have been others with equal powers;
and why may not one among them survive?  Indeed, we are told in the Book
of Samuel that the Witch of Endor was only one of many, and her being
consulted by Saul was a matter of chance.  He only sought one among the
many whom he had driven out of Israel; 'all those that had Familiar
Spirits, and the Wizards.'  This Egyptian Queen, Tera, who reigned
nearly two thousand years before Saul, had a Familiar, and was a Wizard
too.  See how the priests of her time, and those after it tried to wipe
out her name from the face of the earth, and put a curse over the very
door of her tomb so that none might ever discover the lost name.  Ay,
and they succeeded so well that even Manetho, the historian of the
Egyptian Kings, writing in the tenth century before Christ, with all the
lore of the priesthood for forty centuries behind him, and with
possibility of access to every existing record, could not even find her
name.  Did it strike any of you, in thinking of the late events, who or
what her Familiar was?""  There was an interruption, for Doctor
Winchester struck one hand loudly on the other as he ejaculated:

""The cat!  The mummy cat!  I knew it!""  Mr. Trelawny smiled over at him.

""You are right!  There is every indication that the Familiar of the
Wizard Queen was that cat which was mummied when she was, and was not
only placed in her tomb, but was laid in the sarcophagus with her.  That
was what bit into my wrist, what cut me with sharp claws.""  He paused.
Margaret's comment was a purely girlish one:

""Then my poor Silvio is acquitted!  I am glad!""  Her father stroked her
hair and went on:

""This woman seems to have had an extraordinary foresight.  Foresight
far, far beyond her age and the philosophy of her time.  She seems to
have seen through the weakness of her own religion, and even prepared
for emergence into a different world.  All her aspirations were for the
North, the point of the compass whence blew the cool invigorating
breezes that make life a joy.  From the first, her eyes seem to have
been attracted to the seven stars of the Plough from the fact, as
recorded in the hieroglyphics in her tomb, that at her birth a great
aerolite fell, from whose heart was finally extracted that Jewel of
Seven Stars which she regarded as the talisman of her life.  It seems to
have so far ruled her destiny that all her thought and care circled
round it.  The Magic Coffer, so wondrously wrought with seven sides, we
learn from the same source, came from the aerolite.  Seven was to her a
magic number; and no wonder.  With seven fingers on one hand, and seven
toes on one foot.  With a talisman of a rare ruby with seven stars in
the same position as in that constellation which ruled her birth, each
star of the seven having seven points--in itself a geological wonder--it
would have been odd if she had not been attracted by it. Again, she was
born, we learn in the Stele of her tomb, in the seventh month of the
year--the month beginning with the Inundation of the Nile.  Of which
month the presiding Goddess was Hathor, the Goddess of her own house, of
the Antefs of the Theban line--the Goddess who in various forms
symbolises beauty, and pleasure, and resurrection.  Again, in this
seventh month--which, by later Egyptian astronomy began on Octorber 28th,
and ran to the 27th of our November--on the seventh day the Pointer of
the Plough just rises above the horizon of the sky at Thebes.

""In a marvellously strange way, therefore, are grouped into this woman's
life these various things.  The number seven; the Pole Star, with the
constellation of seven stars; the God of the month, Hathor, who was her
own particular God, the God of her family, the Antefs of the Theban
Dynasty, whose Kings"" symbol it was, and whose seven forms ruled love
and the delights of life and resurrection.  If ever there was ground for
magic; for the power of symbolism carried into mystic use; for a belief
in finites spirits in an age which knew not the Living God, it is here.

""Remember, too, that this woman was skilled in all the science of her
time.  Her wise and cautious father took care of that, knowing that by
her own wisdom she must ultimately combat the intrigues of the
Hierarchy.  Bear in mind that in old Egypt the science of Astronomy
began and was developed to an extraordinary height; and that Astrology
followed Astronomy in its progress.  And it is possible that in the
later developments of science with regard to light rays, we may yet find
that Astrology is on a scientific basis.  Our next wave of scientific
thought may deal with this.  I shall have something special to call your
minds to on this point presently.  Bear in mind also that the Egyptians
knew sciences, of which today, despite all our advantages, we are
profoundly ignorant.  Acoustics, for instance, an exact science with the
builders of the temples of Karnak, of Luxor, of the Pyramids, is today
a mystery to Bell, and Kelvin, and Edison, and Marconi.  Again, these
old miracle-workers probably understood some practical way of using
other forces, and amongst them the forces of light that at present we do
not dream of.  But of this matter I shall speak later.  That Magic
Coffer of Queen Tera is probably a magic box in more ways than one.  It
may--possibly it does--contain forces that we wot not of.  We cannot open
it; it must be closed from within.  How then was it closed?  It is a
coffer of solid stone, of amazing hardness, more like a jewel than an
ordinary marble, with a lid equally solid; and yet all is so finely
wrought that the finest tool made today cannot be inserted under the
flange.  How was it wrought to such perfection?  How was the stone so
chosen that those translucent patches match the relations of the seven
stars of the constellation?  How is it, or from what cause, that when
the starlight shines on it, it glows from within--that when I fix the
lamps in similar form the glow grows greater still; and yet the box is
irresponsive to ordinary light however great?  I tell you that that box
hides some great mystery of science.  We shall find that the light will
open it in some way:  either by striking on some substance, sensitive in
a peculiar way to its effect, or in releasing some greater power.  I
only trust that in our ignorance we may not so bungle things as to do
harm to its mechanism; and so deprive the knowledge of our time of a
lesson handed down, as by a miracle, through nearly five thousand years.

""In another way, too, there may be hidden in that box secrets which, for
good or ill, may enlighten the world.  We know from their records, and
inferentially also, that the Egyptians studied the properties of herbs
and minerals for magic purposes--white magic as well as black.  We know
that some of the wizards of old could induce from sleep dreams of any
given kind.  That this purpose was mainly effected by hypnotism, which
was another art or science of Old Nile, I have little doubt.  But still,
they must have had a mastery of drugs that is far beyond anything we
know.  With our own pharmacopoeia we can, to a certain extent, induce
dreams.  We may even differentiate between good and bad-dreams of
pleasure, or disturbing and harrowing dreams.  But these old
practitioners seemed to have been able to command at will any form or
colour of dreaming; could work round any given subject or thought in
almost any was required.  In that coffer, which you have seen, may rest
a very armoury of dreams.  Indeed, some of the forces that lie within it
may have been already used in my household.""  Again there was an
interruption from Doctor Winchester.

""But if in your case some of these imprisoned forces were used, what set
them free at the opportune time, or how?  Besides, you and Mr. Corbeck
were once before put into a trance for three whole days, when you were
in the Queen's tomb for the second time.  And then, as I gathered from
Mr. Corbeck's story, the coffer was not back in the tomb, though the
mummy was.  Surely in both these cases there must have been some active
intelligence awake, and with some other power to wield."" Mr. Trelawny's
answer was equally to the point:

""There was some active intelligence awake.  I am convinced of it.  And
it wielded a power which it never lacks.  I believe that on both those
occasions hypnotism was the power wielded.""

""And wherein is that power contained?  What view do you hold on the
subject?"" Doctor Winchester's voice vibrated with the intensity of his
excitement as he leaned forward, breathing hard, and with eyes staring.
Mr. Trelawny said solemnly:

""In the mummy of the Queen Tera!  I was coming to that presently.
Perhaps we had better wait till I clear the ground a little.  What I
hold is, that the preparation of that box was made for a special
occasion; as indeed were all the preparations of the tomb and all
belonging to it.  Queen Tera did not trouble herself to guard against
snakes and scorpions, in that rocky tomb cut in the sheer cliff face a
hundred feet above the level of the valley, and fifty down from the
summit.  Her precautions were against the disturbances of human hands;
against the jealousy and hatred of the priests, who, had they known of
her real aims, would have tried to baffle them.  From her point of view,
she made all ready for the time of resurrection, whenever that might be.
I gather from the symbolic pictures in the tomb that she so far differed
from the belief of her time that she looked for a resurrection in the
flesh.  It was doubtless this that intensified the hatred of the
priesthood, and gave them an acceptable cause for obliterating the very
existence, present and future, of one who had outrage their theories and
blasphemed their gods.  All that she might require, either in the
accomplishment of the resurrection or after it, were contained in that
almost hermetically sealed suite of chambers in the rock.  In the great
sarcophagus, which as you know is of a size quite unusual even for
kings, was the mummy of her Familiar, the cat, which from its great size
I take to be a sort of tiger-cat.  In the tomb, also in a strong
receptacle, were the canopic jars usually containing those internal
organs which are separately embalmed, but which in this case had no such
contents.  So that, I take it, there was in her case a departure in
embalming; and that the organs were restored to the body, each in its
proper place--if, indeed, they had ever been removed.  If this surmise be
true, we shall find that the brain of the Queen either was never
extracted in the usual way, or, if so taken out, that it was duly
replaced, instead of being enclosed within the mummy wrappings.
Finally, in the sarcophagus there was the Magic Coffer on which her feet
rested.  Mark you also, the care taken in the preservance of her power
to control the elements.  According to her belief, the open hand outside
the wrappings controlled the Air, and the strange Jewel Stone with the
shining stars controlled Fire.  The symbolism inscribed on the soles of
her feet gave sway over Land and Water.  About the Star Stone I shall
tell you later; but whilst we are speaking of the sarcophagus, mark how
she guarded her secret in case of grave-wrecking or intrusion.  None
could open her Magic Coffer without the lamps, for we know now that
ordinary light will not be effective.  The great lid of the sarcophagus
was not sealed down as usual, because she wished to control the air. But
she hid the lamps, which in structure belong to the Magic Coffer, in a
place where none could find them, except by following the secret
guidance which she had prepared for only the eyes of wisdom.  And even
here she had guarded against chance discovery, by preparing a bolt of
death for the unwary discoverer.  To do this she had applied the lesson
of the tradition of the avenging guard of the treasures of the pyramid,
built by her great predecessor of the Fourth Dynasty of the throne of
Egypt.

""You have noted, I suppose, how there were, in the case of her tomb,
certain deviations from the usual rules.  For instance, the shaft of the
Mummy Pit, which is usually filled up solid with stones and rubbish, was
left open.  Why was this?  I take it that she had made arrangements for
leaving the tomb when, after her resurrection, she should be a new
woman, with a different personality, and less inured to the hardships
that in her first existence she had suffered.  So far as we can judge of
her intent, all things needful for her exit into the world had been
thought of, even to the iron chain, described by Van Huyn, close to the
door in the rock, by which she might be able to lower herself to the
ground.  That she expected a long period to elapse was shown in the
choice of material.  An ordinary rope would be rendered weaker or unsafe
in process of time, but she imagined, and rightly, that the iron would
endure.

""What her intentions were when once she trod the open earth afresh we do
not know, and we never shall, unless her own dead lips can soften and
speak.""





Chapter XV
The Purpose of Queen Tera

""Now, as to the Star Jewel!  This she manifestly regarded as the
greatest of her treasures.  On it she had engraven words which none of
her time dared to speak.

""In the old Egyptian belief it was held that there were words, which, if
used properly--for the method of speaking them was as important as the
words themselves--could command the Lords of the Upper and the Lower
Worlds.  The 'hekau', or word of power, was all-important in certain
ritual.  On the Jewel of Seven Stars, which, as you know, is carved into
the image of a scarab, are graven in hieroglyphic two such hekau, one
above, the other underneath.  But you will understand better when you
see it!  Wait here!  Do not stir!""

As he spoke, he rose and left the room.  A great fear for him came over
me; but I was in some strange way relieved when I looked at Margaret.
Whenever there had been any possibility of danger to her father, she had
shown great fear for him; now she was calm and placid.  I said nothing,
but waited.

In two or three minutes, Mr. Trelawny returned.  He held in his hand a
little golden box.  This, as he resumed his seat, he placed before him
on the table.  We all leaned forward as he opened it.

On a lining of white satin lay a wondrous ruby of immense size, almost
as big as the top joint of Margaret's little finger.  It was carven--it
could not possibly have been its natural shape, but jewels do not show
the working of the tool--into the shape of a scarab, with its wings
folded, and its legs and feelers pressed back to its sides. Shining
through its wondrous ""pigeon's blood"" colour were seven different stars,
each of seven points, in such position that they reproduced exactly the
figure of the Plough.  There could be no possible mistake as to this in
the mind of anyone who had ever noted the constellation.  On it were
some hieroglyphic figures, cut with the most exquisite precision, as I
could see when it came to my turn to use the magnifying-glass, which Mr.
Trelawny took from his pocket and handed to us.

When we all had seen it fully, Mr. Trelawny turned it over so that it
rested on its back in a cavity made to hold it in the upper half of the
box.  The reverse was no less wonderful than the upper, being carved to
resemble the under side of the beetle.  It, too, had some hieroglyphic
figures cut on it.  Mr. Trelawny resumed his lecture as we all sat with
our heads close to this wonderful jewel:

""As you see, there are two words, one on the top, the other underneath.
The symbols on the top represent a single word, composed of one syllable
prolonged, with its determinatives.  You know, all of you, I suppose,
that the Egyptian language was phonetic, and that the hieroglyphic
symbol represented the sound.  The first symbol here, the hoe, means
'mer', and the two pointed ellipses the prolongation of the final r:
mer-r-r.  The sitting figure with the hand to its face is what we call
the 'determinative' of 'thought'; and the roll of papyrus that of
'abstraction'.  Thus we get the word 'mer', love, in its abstract,
general, and fullest sense.  This is the hekau which can command the
Upper World.""

Margaret's face was a glory as she said in a deep, low, ringing tone:

""Oh, but it is true.  How the old wonder-workers guessed at almighty
Truth!""  Then a hot blush swept her face, and her eyes fell.  Her father
smiled at her lovingly as he resumed:

""The symbolisation of the word on the reverse is simpler, though the
meaning is more abstruse.  The first symbol means 'men', 'abiding', and
the second, 'ab', 'the heart'.  So that we get 'abiding of heart', or in
our own language 'patience'.  And this is the hekau to control the Lower
World!""

He closed the box, and motioning us to remain as we were, he went back
to his room to replace the Jewel in the safe.  When he had returned and
resumed his seat, he went on:

""That Jewel, with its mystic words, and which Queen Tera held under her
hand in the sarcophagus, was to be an important factor--probably the most
important--in the working out of the act of her resurrection.  From the
first I seemed by a sort of instinct to realise this.  I kept the Jewel
within my great safe, whence none could extract it; not even Queen Tera
herself with her astral body.""

""Her 'astral body'?  What is that, Father?  What does that mean?""
There was a keenness in Margaret's voice as she asked the question which
surprised me a little; but Trelawny smiled a sort of indulgent parental
smile, which came through his grim solemnity like sunshine through a
rifted cloud, as he spoke:

""The astral body, which is a part of Buddhist belief, long subsequent to
the time I speak of, and which is an accepted fact of modern mysticism,
had its rise in Ancient Egypt; at least, so far as we know.  It is that
the gifted individual can at will, quick as thought itself, transfer his
body whithersoever he chooses, by the dissolution and reincarnation of
particles.  In the ancient belief there were several parts of a human
being.  You may as well know them; so that you will understand matters
relative to them or dependent on them as they occur.

""First there is the 'Ka', or 'Double', which, as Doctor Budge explains,
may be defined as 'an abstract individuality of personality' which was
imbued with all the characteristic attributes of the individual it
represented, and possessed an absolutely independent existence.  It was
free to move from place to place on earth at will; and it could enter
into heaven and hold converse with the gods.  Then there was the 'Ba',
or 'soul', which dwelt in the 'Ka', and had the power of becoming
corporeal or incorporeal at will; 'it had both substance and form. . . .
It had power to leave the tomb . . .It could revisit the body in the
tomb . . . and could reincarnate it and hold converse with it.'  Again
there was the 'Khu', the 'spiritual intelligence', or spirit. It took
the form of 'a shining, luminous, intangible shape of the body.'. . .
Then, again, there was the 'Sekhem', or 'power' of a man, his strength
or vital force personified.  These were the 'Khaibit', or 'shadow', the
'Ren', or 'name', the 'Khat', or 'physical body', and 'Ab', the 'heart',
in which life was seated, went to the full making up of a man.

""Thus you will see, that if this division of functions, spiritual and
bodily, ethereal and corporeal, ideal and actual, be accepted as exact,
there are all the possibilities and capabilities of corporeal
transference, guided always by an unimprisonable will or intelligence.""
As he paused I murmured the lines from Shelley's ""Prometheus Unbound"":

                   ""'The Magnus Zoroaster . . . 
            Met his own image walking in the garden.'""

Mr. Trelawny was not displeased.  ""Quite so!"" he said, in his quiet way.
""Shelley had a better conception of ancient beliefs than any of our
poets.""  With a voice changed again he resumed his lecture, for so it
was to some of us:

""There is another belief of the ancient Egyptian which you must bear in
mind; that regarding the ushaptiu figures of Osiris, which were placed
with the dead to its work in the Under World.  The enlargement of this
idea came to a belief that it was possible to transmit, by magical
formulae, the soul and qualities of any living creature to a figure made
in its image.  This would give a terrible extension of power to one who
held the gift of magic.

""It is from a union of these various beliefs, and their natural
corollaries, that I have come to the conclusion that Queen Tera expected
to be able to effect her own resurrection, when, and where, and how, she
would.  That she may have held before her a definite time for making her
effort is not only possible but likely.  I shall not stop now to explain
it, but shall enter upon the subject later on.  With a soul with the
Gods, a spirit which could wander the earth at will, and a power of
corporeal transference, or an astral body, there need be no bounds or
limits to her ambition. The belief is forced upon us that for these
forty or fifty centuries she lay dormant in her tomb-waiting.  Waiting
with that 'patience' which could rule the Gods of the Under World, for
that 'love' which could command those of the Upper World.  What she may
have dreamt we know not; but her dream must have been broken when the
Dutch explorer entered her sculptured cavern, and his follower violated
the sacred privacy of her tomb by his rude outrage in the theft of her
hand.

""That theft, with all that followed, proved to us one thing, however:
that each part of her body, though separated from the rest, can be a
central point or rallying place for the items or particles of her astral
body.  That hand in my room could ensure her instantaneous presence in
the flesh, and its equally rapid dissolution.

""Now comes the crown of my argument.  The purpose of the attack on me
was to get the safe open, so that the sacred Jewel of Seven Stars could
be extracted.  That immense door of the safe could not keep out her
astral body, which, or any part of it, could gather itself as well
within as without the safe.  And I doubt not that in the darkness of the
night that mummied hand sought often the Talisman Jewel, and drew new
inspiration from its touch.  But despite all its power, the astral body
could not remove the Jewel through the chinks of the safe.  The Ruby is
not astral; and it could only be moved in the ordinary way by the
opening of the doors.  To this end, the Queen used her astral body and
the fierce force of her Familiar, to bring to the keyhole of the safe
the master key which debarred her wish.  For years I have suspected,
nay, have believed as much; and I, too, guarded myself against powers of
the Nether World.  I, too, waited in patience till I should have
gathered together all the factors required for the opening of the Magic
Coffer and the resurrection of the mummied Queen!""  He paused, and his
daughter's voice came out sweet and clear, and full of intense feeling:

""Father, in the Egyptian belief, was the power of resurrection of a
mummied body a general one, or was it limited?  That is:  could it
achieve resurrection many times in the course of ages; or only once, and
that one final?""

""There was but one resurrection,"" he answered.  ""There were some who
believed that this was to be a definite resurrection of the body into
the real world.  But in the common belief, the Spirit found joy in the
Elysian Fields, where there was plenty of food and no fear of famine.
Where there was moisture and deep-rooted reeds, and all the joys that
are to be expected by the people of an arid land and burning clime.""

Then Margaret spoke with an earnestness which showed the conviction of
her inmost soul:

""To me, then, it is given to understand what was the dream of this great
and far-thinking and high-souled lady of old; the dream that held her
soul in patient waiting for its realisation through the passing of all
those tens of centuries.  The dream of a love that might be; a love that
she felt she might, even under new conditions, herself evoke.  The love
that is the dream of every woman's life; of the Old and of the New;
Pagan or Christian; under whatever sun; in whatever rank or calling;
however may have been the joy or pain of her life in other ways.  Oh!  I
know it!  I know it!  I am a woman, and I know a woman's heart.  What
were the lack of food or the plenitude of it; what were feast or famine
to this woman, born in a palace, with the shadow of the Crown of the Two
Egypts on her brows!  What were reedy morasses or the tinkle of running
water to her whose barges could sweep the great Nile from the mountains
to the sea.  What were petty joys and absence of petty fears to her, the
raising of whose hand could hurl armies, or draw to the water-stairs of
her palaces the commerce of the world!  At whose word rose temples
filled with all the artistic beauty of the Times of Old which it was her
aim and pleasure to restore!  Under whose guidance the solid rock yawned
into the sepulchre that she designed!

""Surely, surely, such a one had nobler dreams!  I can feel them in my
heart; I can see them with my sleeping eyes!""

As she spoke she seemed to be inspired; and her eyes had a far-away look
as though they saw something beyond mortal sight.  And then the deep
eyes filled up with unshed tears of great emotion.  The very soul of the
woman seemed to speak in her voice; whilst we who listened sat
entranced.

""I can see her in her loneliness and in the silence of her mighty pride,
dreaming her own dream of things far different from those around her.
Of some other land, far, far away under the canopy of the silent night,
lit by the cool, beautiful light of the stars.  A land under that
Northern star, whence blew the sweet winds that cooled the feverish
desert air.  A land of wholesome greenery, far, far away.  Where were no
scheming and malignant priesthood; whose ideas were to lead to power
through gloomy temples and more gloomy caverns of the dead, through an
endless ritual of death!  A land where love was not base, but a divine
possession of the soul!  Where there might be some one kindred spirit
which could speak to hers through mortal lips like her own; whose being
could merge with hers in a sweet communion of soul to soul, even as
their breaths could mingle in the ambient air!  I know the feeling, for
I have shared it myself.  I may speak of it now, since the blessing has
come into my own life.  I may speak of it since it enables me to
interpret the feelings, the very longing soul, of that sweet and lovely
Queen, so different from her surroundings, so high above her time!
Whose nature, put into a word, could control the forces of the Under
World; and the name of whose aspiration, though but graven on a star-lit
jewel, could command all the powers in the Pantheon of the High Gods.

""And in the realisation of that dream she will surely be content to
rest!""

We men sat silent, as the young girl gave her powerful interpretation of
the design or purpose of the woman of old.  Her every word and tone
carried with it the conviction of her own belief.  The loftiness of her
thoughts seemed to uplift us all as we listened.  Her noble words,
flowing in musical cadence and vibrant with internal force, seemed to
issue from some great instrument of elemental power.  Even her tone was
new to us all; so that we listened as to some new and strange being from
a new and strange world.  Her father's face was full of delight.  I knew
now its cause.  I understood the happiness that had come into his life,
on his return to the world that he knew, from that prolonged sojourn in
the world of dreams.  To find in his daughter, whose nature he had never
till now known, such a wealth of affection, such a splendour of
spiritual insight, such a scholarly imagination, such . . . The rest of
his feeling was of hope!

The two other men were silent unconsciously.  One man had had his
dreaming; for the other, his dreams were to come.

For myself, I was like one in a trance.  Who was this new, radiant being
who had won to existence out of the mist and darkness of our fears?
Love has divine possibilities for the lover's heart!  The wings of the
soul may expand at any time from the shoulders of the loved one, who
then may sweep into angel form.  I knew that in my Margaret's nature
were divine possibilities of many kinds.  When under the shade of the
overhanging willow-tree on the river, I had gazed into the depths of her
beautiful eyes, I had thenceforth a strict belief in the manifold
beauties and excellences of her nature; but this soaring and
understanding spirit was, indeed, a revelation.  My pride, like her
father's, was outside myself; my joy and rapture were complete and
supreme!

When we had all got back to earth again in our various ways, Mr.
Trelawny, holding his daughter's hand in his, went on with his
discourse:

""Now, as to the time at which Queen Tera intended her resurrection to
take place! We are in contact with some of the higher astronomical
calculations in connection with true orientation.  As you know, the
stars shift their relative positions in the heavens; but though the real
distances traversed are beyond all ordinary comprehension, the effects
as we see them are small.  Nevertheless, they are susceptible of
measurement, not by years, indeed, but by centuries.  It was by this
means that Sir John Herschel arrived at the date of the building of the
Great Pyramid--a date fixed by the time necessary to change the star of
the true north from Draconis to the Pole Star, and since then verified
by later discoveries.  From the above there can be no doubt whatever
that astronomy was an exact science with the Egyptians at least a
thousand years before the time of Queen Tera.  Now, the stars that go to
make up a constellation change in process of time their relative
positions, and the Plough is a notable example.  The changes in the
position of stars in even forty centuries is so small as to be hardly
noticeable by an eye not trained to minute observances, but they can be
measured and verified.  Did you, or any of you, notice how exactly the
stars in the Ruby correspond to the position of the stars in the Plough;
or how the same holds with regard to the translucent places in the Magic
Coffer?""

We all assented.  He went on:

""You are quite correct.  They correspond exactly.  And yet when Queen
Tera was laid in her tomb, neither the stars in the Jewel nor the
translucent places in the Coffer corresponded to the position of the
stars in the Constellation as they then were!""

We looked at each other as he paused:  a new light was breaking upon us.
With a ring of mastery in his voice he went on:

""Do you not see the meaning of this?  Does it not throw a light on the
intention of the Queen?  She, who was guided by augury, and magic, and
superstition, naturally chose a time for her resurrection which seemed
to have been pointed out by the High Gods themselves, who had seent
their message on a thunderbolt from other worlds.  When such a time was
fixed by supernal wisdom, would it not be the height of human wisdom to
avail itself of it?  Thus it is""--here his voice deepened and trembled
with the intensity of his feeling--""that to us and our time is given the
opportunity of this wondrous peep into the old world, such as has been
the privilege of none other of our time; which may never be again.

""From first to last the cryptic writing and symbolism of that wondrous
tomb of that wondrous woman is fullof guiding light; and the key of the
many mysteries lies in that most wondrous Jewel which she held in her
dead hand over the dead heart, which she hoped and believed would beat
again in a newer and nobler world!

""There are only loose ends now to consider.  Margaret has given us the
true inwardness of the feeling of the other Queen!""  He looked at her
fondly, and stroked her hand as he said it.  ""For my own part I
sincerely hope she is right; for in such case it will be a joy, I am
sure, to all of us to assist at such a realisation of hope.  But we must
not go too fast, or believe too much in our present state of knowledge.
The voice that we hearken for comes out of times strangely other than
our own; when human life counted for little, and when the morality of
the time made little account of the removing of obstacles in the way to
achievement of  desire. We must keep our eyes fixed on the scientific
side, and wait for the developments on the psychic side.

""Now, as to this stone box, which we call the Magic Coffer.  As I have
said, I am convinced that it opens only in obedience to some principle
of light, or the exercise of some of its forces at present unknown to
us.  There is here much ground for conjecture and for experiment; for as
yet the scientists have not thoroughly differentiated the kinds, and
powers, and degrees of light.  Without analysing various rays we may, I
think, take it for granted that there are different qualities and powers
of light; and this great field of scientific investigation is almost
virgin soil.  We know as yet so little of natural forces, that
imagination need set no bounds to its flights in considering the
possibilities of the future.  Within but a few years we have made such
discoveries as two centuries ago would have sent the discoverer's to the
flames.  The liquefaction of oxygen; the existence of radium, of helium,
of polonium, of argon; the different powers of Rontgen and Cathode and
Bequerel rays.  And as we may finally prove that there are different
kinds and qualities of light, so we may find tht combustion may have its
own powers of differentiation; that there are qualities in some flames
non-existent in others.  It may be that some of the essential conditions
of substance are continuous, even in the destruction of their bases.
Last night I was thinking of this, and reasoning that as there are
certain qualities in some oils which are not in others, so there may be
certain similar or corresponding qualities or powers in the combinations
of each.  I suppose we have all noticed some time or other that the
light of colza oil is not quite the same as that of paraffin, or that
the flames of coal gas and whale oil are different.  They find it so in
the light-houses! All at once it occurred to me that there might be some
special virtue in the oil which had been found in the jars when Queen
Tera's tomb was opened.  These had not been used to preserve the
intestines as usual, so they must have been placed there for some other
purpose.  I remembered that in Van Huyn's narrative he had commented on
the way the jars were sealed.  This was lightly, though effectually;
they could be opened without force.  The jars were themselves preserved
in a sarcophagus which, though of immense strength and hermetically
sealed, could be opened easily.  Accordingly, I went at once to examine
the jars.  A little--a very little of the oil still remained, but it had
grown thick in the two and a half centuries in which the jars had been
open.  Still, it was not rancid; and on examining it I found it was
cedar oil, and that it still exhaled something of its original aroma.
This gave me the idea that it was to be used to fill the lamps.  Whoever
had placed the oil in the jars, and the jars in the sarcophagus, knew
that there might be shrinkage in process of time, even in vases of
alabaster, and fully allowed for it; for each of the jars would have
filled the lamps half a dozen times.  With part of the oil remaining I
made some experiments, therefore, which may give useful results.  You
know, Doctor, that cedar oil, which was much used in the preparation and
ceremonials of the Egyptian dead, has a certain refractive power which
we do not find in other oils.  For instance, we use it on the lenses of
our microscopes to give additional clearness of vision.  Last night I
put some in one of the lamps, and placed it near a translucent part of
the Magic Coffer.  The effect was very great; the glow of light within
was fuller and more intense than I could have imagined, where an
electric light similarly placed had little, if any, effect.  I should
have tried others of the seven lamps, but that my supply of oil ran out.
This, however, is on the road to rectification.  I have sent for more
cedar oil, and expect to have before long an ample supply.  Whatever may
happen from other causes, our experiment shall not, at all events, fail
from this.  We shall see!  We shall see!""

Doctor Winchester had evidently been following the logical process of
the other's mind, for his comment was:

""I do hope that when the light is effective in opening the box, the
mechanism will not be impaired or destroyed.""

His doubt as to this gave anxious thought to some of us.





Chapter XVI
Powers--Old and New

The time wore away, wondrous slowly in some ways, wonderfully quickly 
in others.  To-day, in the new-found joyous certainty of the return of 
my love, I should have liked to have had Margaret all to myself.  But 
this day was not for love or for love-making.  The shadow of fearful
expectation was over it.  The more I thought over the coming experiment, 
the more strange it all seemed; and the more foolish were we who were 
deliberately entering upon it.  It was all so stupendous, so mysterious, 
so unnecessary!  The issues were so vast; the danger so strange, so 
unknown.  Even if it should be successful, what new difficulties would 
it not raise.  What changes might happen, did men know that the portals 
of the House of Death were not in very truth eternally fixed; and that 
the Dead could come forth again!  Could we realize what it was for us 
modern mortals to be arrayed against the Gods of Old, with their 
mysterious powers gotten from natural forces, or begotten of them when 
the world was young.  When land and water were forming themselves from 
out the primeval slime.  When the very air was purifying itself from 
elemental dross.  When the ""dragons of the prime"" were changing their 
forms and their powers, made only to combat with geologic forces, to 
grow in accord with the new vegetable life which was springing up 
around them.  When animals, when even man himself and man's advance 
were growths as natural as the planetary movements, growths as 
natural as the planetary movements, or the shining of the stars. 
Ay! and further back still, when as yet the Spirit which moved on 
the face of the waters had not spoken the words commanding to come 
into existence Light and the Life which followed it.

Nay, even beyond this was a still more overwhelming conjecture.  The 
whole possibility of the Great Experiment to which we were now pledged 
was based on the reality of the existence of the Old Forces which seemed 
to be coming in contact with the New Civilization.  That there were, and 
are, such cosmic forces we cannot doubt, and that the Intelligence, 
which is behind them, was and is.  Were those primal and elemental forces 
controlled at any time by other than that Final Cause which Christendom 
holds as its very essence?  If there were truth at all in the belief of 
Ancient Egypt then their Gods had real existence, real power, real force. 
Godhead is not a quality subject to the ills of mortals: as in its 
essence it is creative and recreative, it cannot die.  Any belief to the 
contrary would be antagonistic to reason; for it would hold that a part 
is greater than the whole.  If then the Old Gods held their forces, wherein 
was the supremacy of the new?  Of course, if the Old Gods had lost their 
power, or if they never had any, the Experiment could not succeed.  But 
if it should indeed succeed, or if there were a possibility of success, 
then we should be face to face with an inference so overwhelming that 
one hardly dared to follow it to its conclusion.  This would be: that the
struggle between Life and Death would no longer be a matter of the
earth, earthy; that the war of supra-elemental forces would be moved
from the tangible world of facts to the Mid-Region, wherever it may be, 
which is the home of the Gods.  Did such a region exist?  What was it that 
Milton saw with his blind eyes in the rays of poetic light falling
between him and Heaven?  Whence came that stupendous vision of the 
Evangelist which has for eighteen centuries held spellbound the intelligence 
of Christendom?  Was there room in the Universe for opposing Gods; or if 
such there were, would the stronger allow manifestations of power on the 
part of the opposing Force which would tend to the weakening of His own 
teaching and designs?  Surely, surely if this supposition were correct 
there would be some strange and awful development--something unexpected 
and unpredictable--before the end should be allowed to come. . . !

The subject was too vast and, under the present conditions, too full of 
strange surmises.  I dared not follow it! I set myself to wait in patience 
till the time should come.

Margaret remained divinely calm.  I think I envied her, even whilst I 
admired and loved her for it.  Mr Trelawny was nervously anxious, as 
indeed were the other men.  With him it took the form of movement; 
movement both of body and mind.  In both respects he was restless, going 
from one place to another with or without a cause, or even a pretext; 
and changing from one subject of thought to another.  Now and again he 
would show glimpses of the harrowing anxiety which filled him, by his 
manifest expectation of finding a similar condition in myself.  He would 
be ever explaining things.  And in his explanations I could see the way 
in which he was turning over in his mind all the phenomena; all the 
possible causes; all the possible results.  Once, in the midst of a most 
learned dissertation on the growth of Egyptian Astrology, he broke out 
on a different subject, or rather a branch or corollary of the same:

""I do not see why starlight may not have some subtle quality of its own! 
We know that other lights have special forces.  The Rontgen Ray is not 
the only discovery to be made in the world of light.  Sunlight has its 
own forces, that are not given to other lights.  It warms wine; it quickens 
fungoid growth.  Men are often moonstruck.  Why not, then, a more subtle, 
if less active or powerful, force in the light of the stars.  It should 
be a pure light coming through such vastness of space, and may have a 
quality which a pure, unimpulsive force may have.  The time may not be 
far off when Astrology shall be accepted on a scientific basis.  In the 
recrudescence of the art, many new experiences will be brought to bear; 
many new phases of old wisdom will appear in the light of fresh discovery, 
and afford bases for new reasoning.  Men may find that what seemed empiric 
deductions were in reality the results of a loftier intelligence and a 
learning greater than our own.  We know already that the whole of the 
living world is full of microbes of varying powers and of methods of 
working quite antagonistic.  We do not know yet whether they can lie latent 
until quickened by some ray of light as yet unidentified as a separate 
and peculiar force.  As yet we know nothing of what goes to create or 
evoke the active spark of life.  We have no knowledge of the methods of 
conception; of the laws which govern molecular or foetal growth, of the 
final influences which attend birth.  Year by year, day by day, hour by 
hour, we are learning; but the end is far, far off.  It seems to me that
we are now in that stage of intellectual progress in which the rough 
machinery for making discovery is being invented.  Later on, we shall have 
enough of first principles to help us in the development of equipment 
for the true study of the inwardness of things.  Then we may perhaps arrive 
at the perfection of means to an end which the scholars of Old Nile 
achieved at a time when Methuselah was beginning to brag about the number 
of his years, perhaps even when the great grandchildren of Adam were 
coming to regard the old man as what our Transatlantic friends call a 
'back number.'  Is it possible, for instance, that the people who invented 
Astronomy did not finally use instruments of extraordinary precision; 
that applied optics was not a cult of some of the specialists in the 
Colleges of the Theban priesthood.  The Egyptians were essentially 
specialists.  It is true that, in so far as we can judge, the range of 
their study was limited to subjects connected with their aims of government 
on earth by controlling all that bore on the life to follow it.  But can 
anyone imagine that by the eyes of men, unaided by lenses of wondrous 
excellence, Astronomy was brought to such a pitch that the true orientation 
of temples and pyramids and tombs followed for four thousand years the 
wanderings of the planetary systems in space.  If an instance of their 
knowledge of microscopy is wanted let me hazard a conjecture.  How was 
it that in their hieroglyphic writing they took as the symbol or 
determinative of 'flesh' the very form which the science of to-day, 
relying on the revelations of a microscope of a thousand powers, gives 
to protoplasm--that unit of living organism which has been differentiated
as Flagellula.  If they could make analysis like this, why may they not 
have gone further?  In that wonderful atmosphere of theirs, where sunlight 
fierce and clear is perpetually co-existent with day, where the dryness 
of earth and air gives perfect refraction, why may they not have learned 
secrets of light hidden from us in the density of our northern mists? 
May it not have been possible that they learned to store light, just as 
we have learned to store electricity.  Nay more, is it not even possible 
that they did so.  They must have had some form of artificial light which 
they used in the construction and adornment of those vast caverns hewn 
in the solid rock which became whole cemeteries of the dead.  Why, some 
of these caverns, with their labyrinthine windings and endless passages 
and chambers, all sculptured and graven and painted with an elaboration 
of detail which absolutely bewilders one, must have taken years and years 
to complete.  And yet in them is no mark of smoke, such as lamps or torches 
would have left behind them.  Again, if they knew how to store light, is 
it not possible that they had learned to understand and separate its 
component elements?  And if these men of old arrived at such a point, 
may not we too in the fullness of time?  We shall see!  We shall see!

""There is another matter, too, on which recent discoveries in science 
throw a light.  It is only a glimmer at present; a glimmer sufficient to 
illuminate probabilities, rather than actualities, or even possibilities. 
The discoveries of the Curies and Laborde, of Sir William Crooks and 
Becquerel, may have far-reaching results on Egyptian investigation.  This 
new metal, radium--or rather this old metal of which our knowledge is 
new--may have been known to the ancients.  Indeed it may have been used 
thousands of years ago in greater degree than seems possible to-day.  As 
yet Egypt has not been named as a place where the discovery of pitchblende, 
in which only as far as is known yet radium is contained, may be made. 
And yet it is more than probable that radium exists in Egypt.  That country 
has perhaps the greatest masses of granite to be found in the world; and 
pitchblende is found as a vein in granitic rocks.  In no place, at no 
time, has granite ever been quarried in such proportions as in Egypt 
during the earlier dynasties.  Who may say what great veins of pitchblende 
may not have been found in the gigantic operations of hewing out columns
for the temples, or great stones for the pyramids.  Why, veins of pitchblende, 
of a richness unknown in our recent mines in Cornwall, or Bohemia, or 
Saxony, or Hungary, or Turkey, or Colorado, may have been found by these 
old quarrymen of Aswan, or Turra, or Mokattam, or Elephantine.

""Beyond this again, it is possible that here and there amongst these vast 
granite quarries may have been found not merely veins but masses or 
pockets of pitchblende.  In such case the power at the disposal of those 
who knew how to use it must have been wonderful.  The learning of Egypt 
was kept amongst its priests, and in their vast colleges must have been 
men of great learning; men who knew well how to exercise to the best 
advantage, and in the direction they wished, the terrific forces at their 
command.  And if pitchblende did and does exist in Egypt, do you not 
think that much of it must have been freed by the gradual attrition and 
wearing down of the granitic rocks?  Time and weather bring in time all 
rocks to dust; the very sands of the desert, which in centuries have 
buried in this very land some of the greatest monuments of man's 
achievement, are the evidences of the fact.  If, then, radium is divisible 
into such minute particles as the scientists tell us, it too must have 
been freed in time from its granite prison and left to work in the air. 
One might almost hazard a suggestion that the taking the scarab as the 
symbol of life may not have been without an empiric basis.  Might it not 
be possible that Coprophagi have power or instinct to seize upon the 
minute particles of heat-giving, light-giving--perhaps life-giving--
radium, and enclosing them with their ova in those globes of matter 
which they roll so assiduously, and from which they take their early 
name, Pilulariae.  In the billions of tons of the desert waste there is 
surely mingled some proportion of each of the earths and rocks and metals
of their zone; and, each to each, nature forms her living entities to
flourish on those without life.

""Travellers tell us that glass left in tropic deserts changes colour, 
and darkens in the fierce sunlight, just as it does under the influence
of the rays of radium.  Does not this imply some sort of similarity 
between the two forces yet to be identified!""

These scientific, or quasi-scientific discussions soothed me.  They took 
my mind from brooding on the mysteries of the occult, by attracting it 
to the wonders of nature.





Chapter XVII
The Cavern

In the evening Mr. Trelawny took again the whole party into the study.
When we were all attention he began to unfold his plans:

""I have come to the conclusion that for the proper carrying out of what
we will call our Great Experiment we must have absolute and complete
isolation.  Isolation not merely for a day or two, but for as long as we
may require.  Here such a thing would be impossible; the needs and
habits of a great city with its ingrained possibilities of interruption,
would, or might, quite upset us.  Telegrams, registered letters, or
express messengers would alone be sufficient; but the great army of
those who want to get something would make disaster certain.  In
addition, the occurrences of the last week have drawn police attention
to this house.  Even if special instructions to keep an eye on it have
not been issued from Scotland Yard or the District Station, you may be
sure that the individual policeman on his rounds will keep it well under
observation.  Besides, the servants who have discharged themselves will
before long begin to talk.  They must; for they have, for the sake of
their own characters, to give some reason for the termination of a
service which has I should say a position in the neighbourhood.  The
servants of the neighbours will begin to talk, and, perhaps the
neighbours themselves.  Then the active and intelligent Press will, with
its usual zeal for the enlightenment of the public and its eye to
increase of circulation, get hold of the matter.  When the reporter is
after us we shall not have much chance of privacy.  Even if we were to
bar ourselves in, we should not be free from interruption, possibly from
intrusion.  Either would ruin our plans, and so we must take measures to
effect a retreat, carrying all our impedimenta with us.  For this I am
prepared.  For a long time past I have foreseen such a possibility, and
have made preparation for it.  Of course, I had no foreknowledge of what
has happened; but I knew something would, or might, happen.  For more
than two years past my house in Cornwall has been made ready to receive
all the curios which are preserved here. When Corbeck went off on his
search for the lamps I had the old house at Kyllion made ready; it is
fitted with electric light all over, and all the appliances for
manufacture of the light are complete.  I had perhaps better tell you,
for none of you, not even Margaret, knows anything of it, that the house
is absolutely shut out from public access or even from view.  It stands
on a little rocky promontory behind a steep hill, and except from the
sea cannot be seen.  Of old it was fenced in by a high stone wall, for
the house which it succeeded was built by an ancestor of mine in the
days when a great house far away from a centre had to be prepared to
defend itself. Here, then, is a place so well adapted to our needs that
it might have been prepared on purpose.  I shall explain it to you when
we are all there.  This will not be long, for already our movement is in
train.  I have sent word to Marvin to have all preparation for our
transport ready.  He is to have a special train, which is to run at
night so as to avoid notice.  Also a number of carts and stone-wagons,
with sufficient men and appliances to take all our packing-cases to
Paddington.  We shall be away before the Argus-eyed Pressman is on the
watch.  We shall today begin our packing up; and I dare say that by
tomorrow night we shall be ready.  In the outhouses I have all the
packing-cases which were used for bringing the things from Egypt, and I
am satisfied that as they were sufficient for the journey across the
desert and down the Nile to Alexandria and thence on to London, they
will serve without fail between here and Kyllion.  We four men, with
Margaret to hand us such things as we may require, will be able to get
the things packed safely; and the carrier's men will take them to the
trucks.

""today the servants go to Kyllion, and Mrs. Grant will make such
arrangements as may be required.  She will take a stock of necessaries
with her, so that we will not attract local attention by our daily
needs; and will keep us supplied with perishable food from London.
Thanks to Margaret's wise and generous treatment of the servants who
decided to remain, we have got a staff on which we can depend.  They
have been already cautioned to secrecy, so that we need not fear gossip
from within. Indeed, as the servants will be in London after their
preparations at Kyllion are complete, there will not be much subject for
gossip, in detail at any rate.

""As, however, we should commence the immediate work of packing at once,
we will leave over the after proceedings till later when we have
leisure.""

Accordingly we set about our work.  Under Mr. Trelawny's guidance, and
aided by the servants, we took from the outhouses great packing-cases.
Some of these were of enormous strength, fortified by many thicknesses
of wood, and by iron bands and rods with screw-ends and nuts.  We placed
them throughout the house, each close to the object which it was to
contain.  When this preliminary work had been effected, and there had
been placed in each room and in the hall great masses of new hay,
cotton-waste and paper, the servants were sent away.  Then we set about
packing.

No one, not accustomed to packing, could have the slightest idea of the
amount of the amount of work involved in such a task as that in which in
we were engaged.  For my own part I had had a vague idea that there were
a large number of Egyptian objects in Mr. Trelawny's house; but until I
came to deal with them seriatim I had little idea of either their
importance, the size of some of them, or of their endless number.  Far
into the night we worked.  At times we used all the strength which we
could muster on a single object; again we worked separately, but always
under Mr. Trelawny's immediate direction.  He himself, assisted by
Margaret, kept an exact tall of each piece.

It was only when we sat down, utterly wearied, to a long-delayed supper
that we began to realised that a large part of the work was done.  Only
a few of the packing-cases, however, were closed; for a vast amount of
work still remained.  We had finished some of the cases, each of which
held only one of the great sarcophagi. The cases which held many objects
could not be closed till all had been differentiated and packed.

I slept that night without movement or without dreams; and on our
comparing notes in the morning, I found that each of the others had had
the same experience.

By dinner-time next evening the whole work was complete, and all was
ready for the carriers who were to come at midnight.  A little before
the appointed time we heard the rumble of carts; then we were shortly
invaded by an army of workmen, who seemed by sheer force of numbers to
move without effort, in an endless procession, all our prepared
packages.  A little over an hour sufficed them, and when the carts had
rumbled away, we all got ready to follow them to Paddington.  Silvio was
of course to be taken as one of our party.

Before leaving we went in a body over the house, which looked desolate
indeed.  As the servants had all gone to Cornwall there had been no
attempt at tidying-up; every room and passage in which we had worked,
and all the stairways, were strewn with paper and waste, and marked with
dirty feet.

The last thing which Mr. Trelawny did before coming away was to take
from the great safe the Ruby with the Seven Stars.  As he put it safely
into his pocket-book, Margaret, who had all at once seemed to grow
deadly tired and stood beside her father pale and rigid, suddenly became
all aglow, as though the sight of the Jewel had inspired her.  She
smiled at her father approvingly as she said:

""You are right, Father.  There will not be any more trouble tonight.
She will not wreck your arrangements for any cause.  I would stake my
life upon it.""

""She--or something--wrecked us in the desert when we had come from the
tomb in the Valley of the Sorcerer!"" was the grim comment of Corbeck,
who was standing by. Margaret answered him like a flash:

""Ah! she was then near her tomb from which for thousands of years her
body had not been moved.  She must know that things are different now.""

""How must she know?"" asked Corbeck keenly.

""If she has that astral body that Father spoke of, surely she must know!
How can she fail to, with an invisible presence and an intellect that
can roam abroad even to the stars and the worlds beyond us!""  She
paused, and her father said solemnly:

""It is on that supposition that we are proceeding.  We must have the
courage of our convictions, and act on them--to the last!""

Margaret took his hand and held it in a dreamy kind of way as we filed
out of the house.  She was holding it still when he locked the hall
door, and when we moved up the road to the gateway, whence we took a cab
to Paddington.

When all the goods were loaded at the station, the whole of the workmen
went on to the train; this took also some of the stone-wagons used for
carrying the cases with the great sarcophagi.  Ordinary carts and plenty
of horses were to be found at Westerton, which was our station for
Kyllion.  Mr. Trelawny had ordered a sleeping-carriage for our party;
as soon as the train had started we all turned into our cubicles.

That night I slept sound.  There was over me a conviction of security
which was absolute and supreme.  Margaret's definite announcement:
""There will not be any trouble tonight!"" seemed to carry assurance with
it.  I did not question it; nor did anyone else.  It was only afterwards
that I began to think as to how she was so sure. The train was a slow
one, stopping many times and for considerable intervals.  As Mr.
Trelawny did not wish to arrive at Westerton before dark, there was no
need to hurry; and arrangements had been made to feed the workmen at
certain places on the journey.  We had our own hamper with us in the
private car.

All that afternoon we talked over the Great Experiment, which seemed to
have become a definite entity in our thoughts.  Mr. Trelawny became more
and more enthusiastic as the time wore on; hope was with him becoming
certainty.  Doctor Winchester seemed to become imbued with some of his
spirit, though at times he would throw out some scientific fact which
would either make an impasse to the other's line of argument, or would
come as an arresting shock.  Mr. Corbeck, on the other hand, seemed
slightly antagonistic to the theory.  It may have been that whilst the
opinions of the others advanced, his own stood still; but the effect was
an attitude which appeared negative, if not wholly one of negation.

As for Margaret, she seemed to be in some way overcome.  Either it was
some new phase of feeling with her, or else she was taking the issue
more seriously than she had yet done.  She was generally more or less
distraite, as though sunk in a brown study; from this she would recover
herself with a start.  This was usually when there occurred some marked
episode in the journey, such as stopping at a station, or when the
thunderous rumble of crossing a viaduct woke the echoes of the hills or
cliffs around us.  On each such occasion she would plunge into the
conversation, taking such a part in it as to show that, whatever had
been her abstracted thought, her senses had taken in fully all that had
gone on around her.  Towards myself her manner was strange.  Sometimes
it was marked by a distance, half shy, half haughty, which was new to
me.  At other times there were moments of passion in look and gesture
which almost made me dizzy with delight.  Little, however, of a marked
nature transpired during the journey.  There was but one episode which
had in it any element of alarm, but as we were all asleep at the time it
did not disturb us. We only learned it from a communicative guard in the
morning.  Whilst running between Dawlish and Teignmouth the train was
stopped by a warning given by someone who moved a torch to and fro right
on the very track.  The driver had found on pulling up that just ahead
of the train a small landslip had taken place, some of the red earth
from the high bank having fallen away.  It did not however reach to the
metals; and the driver had resumed his way, none too well pleased at the
delay.  To use his own words, the guard thought ""there was too much
bally caution on this 'ere line!'""

We arrived at Westerton about nine o'clock in the evening.  Carts and
horses were in waiting, and the work of unloading the train began at
once.  Our own party did not wait to see the work done, as it was in the
hands of competent people.  We took the carriage which was in waiting,
and through the darkness of the night sped on to Kyllion.

We were all impressed by the house as it appeared in the bright
moonlight.  A great grey stone mansion of the Jacobean period; vast and
spacious, standing high over the sea on the very verge of a high cliff.
When we had swept round the curve of the avenue cut through the rock,
and come out on the high plateau on which the house stood, the crash and
murmur of waves breaking against rock far below us came with an
invigorating breath of moist sea air.  We understood then in an instant
how well we were shut out from the world on that rocky shelf above the
sea.

Within the house we found all ready.  Mrs. Grant and her staff had
worked well, and all was bright and fresh and clean.  We took a brief
survey of the chief rooms and then separated to have a wash and to
change our clothes after our long journey of more than four-and-twenty
hours.

We had supper in the great dining-room on the south side, the walls of
which actually hung over the sea.  The murmur came up muffled, but it
never ceased.  As the little promontory stood well out into the sea, the
northern side of the house was open; and the due north was in no way
shut out by the great mass of rock, which, reared high above us, shut
out the rest of the world.  Far off across the bay we could see the
trembling lights of the castle, and here and there along the shore the
faint light of a fisher's window.  For the rest the sea was a dark blue
plain with an occasional flicker of light as the gleam of starlight fell
on the slope of a swelling wave.

When supper was over we all adjourned to the room which Mr. Trelawny had
set aside as his study, his bedroom being close to it.  As we entered,
the first thing I noticed was a great safe, somewhat similar to that
which stood in his room in London.  When we were in the room Mr.
Trelawny went over to the table, and, taking out his pocket-book, laid
it on the table.  As he did so he pressed down on it with the palm of
his hand.  A strange pallor came over his face.  With fingers that
trembled he opened the book, saying as he did so:

""Its bulk does not seem the same; I hope nothing has happened!""

All three of us men crowded round close.  Margaret alone remained calm;
she stood erect and silent, and still as a statue.  She had a far-away
look in her eyes, as though she did not either know or care what was
going on around her.

With a despairing gesture Trelawny threw open the pouch of the
pocket-book wherein he had placed the Jewel of Seven Stars.  As he sank
down on the chair which stood close to him, he said in a hoarse voice:

""My God! it is gone.  Without it the Great Experiment can come to
nothing!""

His words seemed to wake Margaret from her introspective mood.  An
agonised spasm swept her face; but almost on the instant she was calm.
She almost smiled as she said:

""You may have left it in your room, Father.  Perhaps it has fallen out
of the pocket-book whilst you were changing.""  Without a word we all
hurried into the next room through the open door between the study and
the bedroom.  And then a sudden calm fell on us like a cloud of fear.

There! on the table, lay the Jewel of Seven Stars, shining and sparkling
with lurid light, as though each of the seven points of each the seven
stars gleamed through blood!

Timidly we each looked behind us, and then at each other.  Margaret was
now like the rest of us.  She had lost her statuesque calm.  All the
introspective rigidity had gone from her; and she clasped her hands
together till the knuckles were white.

Without a word Mr. Trelawny raised the Jewel, and hurried with it into
the next room.  As quietly as he could he opened the door of the safe
with the key fastened to his wrist and placed the Jewel within.  When
the heavy doors were closed and locked he seemed to breathe more freely.

Somehow this episode, though a disturbing one in many ways, seemed to
bring us back to our old selves.  Since we had left London we had all
been overstrained; and this was a sort of relief.  Another step in our
strange enterprise had been effected.

The change back was more marked in Margaret than in any of us.  Perhaps
it was that she was a woman, whilst we were men; perhaps it was that she
was younger than the rest; perhaps both reasons were effective, each in
its own way.  At any rate the change was there, and I was happier than I
had been through the long journey.  All her buoyancy, her tenderness,
her deep feeling seemed to shine forth once more; now and again as her
father's eyes rested on her, his face seemed to light up.

Whilst we waited for the carts to arrive, Mr. Trelawny took us through
the house, pointing out and explaining where the objects which we had
brought with us were to be placed.  In one respect only did he withhold
confidence.  The positions of all those things which had connection with
the Great Experiment were not indicated. The cases containing them were
to be left in the outer hall, for the present.

By the time we had made the survey, the carts began to arrive; and the
stir and bustle of the previous night were renewed.  Mr. Trelawny stood
in the hall beside the massive ironbound door, and gave directions as to
the placing of each of the great packing-cases.  Those containing many
items were placed in the inner hall where they were to be unpacked.

In an incredibly short time the whole consignment was delivered; and the
m en departed with a douceur for each, given through their foreman,
which made them effusive in their thanks.  Then we all went to our own
rooms.  There was a strange confidence over us all.  I do not think that
any one of us had a doubt as the the quiet passing of the remainder of
the night.

The faith was justified, for on our re-assembling in the morning we
found that all had slept well and peaceably.

During that day all the curios, except those required for the Great
Experiment, were put into the places designed for them.  Then it was
arranged that all the servants should go back with Mrs. Grant to London
on the next morning.

When they had all gone Mr. Trelawny, having seen the doors locked, took
us into the study.

""Now,"" said he when we were seated, ""I have a secret to impart; but,
according to an old promise which does not leave me free, I must ask you
each to give me a solemn promise not to reveal it.  For three hundred
years at least such a promise has been exacted from everyone to whom it
ws told, and more than once life and safety were secured through loyal
observance of the promise.  Even as it is, I am breaking the letter, if
not the spirit of the tradition; for I should only tell it to the
immediate members of my family.""

We all gave the promise required.  Then he went on:

""There is a secret place in this house, a cave, natural originally but
finished by labour, underneath this house.  I will not undertake to say
that it has always been used according to the law.  During the Bloody
Assize more than a few Cornishmen found refuge in it; and later, and
earlier, it formed, I have no doubt whatever, a useful place for storing
contraband goods.  'Tre Pol and Pen', I suppose you know, have always
been smugglers; and their relations and friends and neighbours have not
held back from the enterprise.  For all such reasons a safe hiding-place
was always considered a valuable possession; and as the heads of our
House have always insisted on preserving the secret, I am in honour
bound to it.  Later on, if all be well, I shall of course tell you,
Margaret, and you too, Ross, under the conditions that I am bound to
make.""

He rose up, and we all followed him.  Leaving us in the outer hall, he
went away alone for a few minutes; and returning, beckoned us to follow
him.

In the inside hall we found a whole section of an outstanding angle
moved away, and from the cavity saw a great hole dimly dark, and the
beginning of a rough staircase cut in the rock.  As it was not pitch
dark there was manifestly some means of lighting it naturally, so
without pause we followed our host as he descended.  After some forty or
fifty steps cut in a winding passage, we came to a great cave whose
further end tapered away into blackness.  It was a huge place, dimly lit
by a few irregular slits of eccentric shape.  Manifestly these were
faults in the rock which would readily allow the windows be disguised.
Close to each of them was a hanging shutter which could be easily swung
across by means of a dangling rope. The sound of the ceaseless beat of
the waves came up muffled from far below.  Mr. Trelawny at once began to
speak:

""This is the spot which I have chosen, as the best I know, for the scene
of our Great Experiment.  In a hundred different ways it fulfils the
conditions which I am led to believe are primary with regard to success.
Here, we are, and shall be, as isolated as Queen Tera herself would have
been in her rocky tomb in the Valley of the Sorcerer, and still in a
rocky cavern.  For good or ill we must here stand by our chances, and
abide by results.  If we are successful we shall be able to let in on
the world of modern science such a flood of light from the Old World as
will change every condition of thought and experiment and practice.  If
we fail, then even the knowledge of our attempt will die with us.  For
this, and all else which may come, I believe we are prepared!""  He
paused.  No one spoke, but we all bowed our heads gravely in
acquiescence.  He resumed, but with a certain hesitancy:

""It is not yet too late!  If any of you have a doubt or misgiving, for
God's speak it now!  Whoever it may be, can go hence without let or
hindrance.  The rest of us can go on our way alone!""

Again he paused, and looked keenly at us in turn.  We looked at each
other; but no one quailed.  For my own part, if I had had any doubt as
to going on, the look on Margaret's face would have reassured me.  It
was fearless; it was intense; it was full of a divine calm.

Mr. Trelawny took a long breath, and in a more cheerful, as well as in a
more decided tone, went on:

""As we are all of one mind, the sooner we get the necessary matters in
train the better.  Let me tell you that this place, like all the rest of
the house, can be lit with electricity.  We could not join the wires to
the mains lest our secret should become known, but I have a cable her
which we can attach in the hall and complete the circuit!""  As he was
speaking, he began to ascend the steps.  From close to the entrance he
took the end of a cable; this he drew forward and attached to a switch
in the wall.  Then, turning on a tap, he flooded the whole vault and
staircase below with light.  I could now see from the volume of light
streaming up into the hallway that the hole beside the staircase went
direct into the cave.  Above it was a pulley and a mass of strong tackle
with multiplying blocks of the Smeaton order.  Mr. Trelawny, seeing me
looking at this, said, correctly interpreting my thoughts:

""Yes! it is new.  I hung it there myself on purpose.  I knew we should
have to lower great weights; and as I did not wish to take too many into
my confidence, I arranged a tackle which I could work alone if
necessary.""

We set to work at once; and before nightfall had lowered, unhooked, and
placed in the positions designated for each by Trelawny, all the great
sarcophagi and all the curios and other matters which we had taken with
us.

It was a strange and weird proceeding, the placing of those wonderful
monuments of a bygone age in that green cavern, which represented in its
cutting and purpose and up-to-date mechanism and electric lights both
the old world and the new.  But as time went on I grew more and more to
recognise the wisdom and correctness of Mr. Trelawny's choice.  I was
much disturbed when Silvio, who had been brought into the cave in the
arms of his mistress, and who was lying asleep on my coat which I had
taken off, sprang up when the cat mummy had been unpacked, and flew at
it with the same ferocity which he had previously exhibited.  The
incident showed Margaret in a new phase, and one which gave my heart a
pang.  She had been standing quite still at one side of the cave leaning
on a sarcophagus, in one of those fits of abstraction which had of late
come upon her; but on hearing the sound, and seeing Silvio's violent
onslaught, she seemed to fall into a positive fury of passion. Her eyes
blazed, and her mouth took a hard, cruel tension which was new to me.
Instinctively she stepped towards Silvio as if to interfere in the
attack.  But I too had stepped forward; and as she caught my eye a
strange spasm came upon her, and she stopped.  Its intensity made me
hold my breath; and I put up my hand to clear your eyes.  When I had
done this, she had on the instant recovered her calm, and there was a
look of brief wonder on her face.  With all her old grace and sweetness
she swept over and lifted Silvio, just as she had done on former
occasions, and held him in her arms, petting him and treating him as
though he were a little child who had erred.

As I looked a strange fear came over me.  The Margaret that I knew
seemed to be changing; and in my inmost heart I prayed that the
disturbing cause might soon come to an end.  More than ever I longed at
that moment that our terrible Experiment should come to a prosperous
termination.

When all had been arranged in the room as Mr. Trelawny wished he turned
to us, one after another, till he had concentrated the intelligence of
us all upon him.  Then he said:

""All is now ready in this place.  We must only await the proper time to
begin.""

We were silent for a while.  Doctor Winchester was the first to speak:

""What is the proper time?  Have you any approximation, even if you are
not satisfied as to the exact day?""  He answered at once:

""After the most anxious thought I have fixed on July 31!""

""May I ask why that date?""  He spoke his answer slowly:

""Queen Tera was ruled in great degree by mysticism, and there are so
many evidences that she looked for resurrection that naturally she would
choose a period ruled over by a God specialised to such a purpose.  Now,
the fourth month of the season of Inundation was ruled by Harmachis,
this being the name for 'Ra', the Sun-God, at his rising in the morning,
and therefore typifying the awakening or arising.  This arising is
manifestly to physical life, since it is of the mid-world of human daily
life.  Now as this month begins on our 25th July, the seventh day would
be July 31st, for you may be sure that the mystic Queen would not have
chosen any day but the seventh or some power of seven.

""I dare say that some of you have womdered why our preparations have
been so deliberately undertaken.  This is why!  We must be ready in
every possible way when the time comes; but there was no use in having
to wait round for a needless number of days.""

And so we waited only for the 31st of July, the next day but one, when
the Great Experiment would be made.





Chapter XVIII
Doubts and Fears

We learn of great things by little experiences.  The history of ages is
but an indefinite repetition of the history of hours.  The record of a
soul is but a multiple of the story of a moment.  The Recording Angel
writes in the Great Book in no rainbow tints; his pen is dipped in no
colours but light and darkness.  For the eye of infinite wisdom there is
no need of shading.  All things, all thoughts, all emotions, all
experiences, all doubts and hopes and fears, all intentions, all wishes
seen down to the lower strata of their concrete and multitudinous
elements, are finally resolved into direct opposites.

Did any human being wish for the epitome of a life wherein were gathered
and grouped all the experiences that a child of Adam could have, the
history, fully and frankly written, of my own mind during the next
forty-eight hours would afford him all that could be wanted.  And the
Recorder could have wrought as usual in sunlight and shadow, which may
be taken to represent the final expressions of Heaven and Hell.  For in
the highest Heaven is Faith; and Doubt hangs over the yawning blackness
of Hell.

There were of course times of sunshine in those two days; moments when,
in the realisation of Margaret's sweetness and her love for me, all
doubts were dissipated like morning mist before the sun.  But the
balance of the time-and an overwhelming balance it was-gloom hung over
me like a pall.  The hour, in whose coming I had acquiesced, was
approaching so quickly and was already so near that the sense of
finality was bearing upon me!  The issue was perhaps life or death to
any of us; but for this we were all prepared.  Margaret and I were one
as to the risk.  The question of the moral aspect of the case, which
involved the religious belief in which I had been reared, was not one to
trouble me; for the issues, and the causes that lay behind them, were
not within my power even to comprehend.  The doubt of the success of the
Great Experiment was such a doubt as exists in all enterprises which
have great possibilities.  To me, whose life was passed in a series of
intellectual struggles, this form of doubt was a stimulus, rather than
deterrent.  What then was it that made for me a trouble, which became an
anguish when my thoughts dwelt long on it?

I was beginning to doubt Margaret!

What it was that I doubted I knew not.  It was not her love, or her
honour, or her truth, or her kindness, or her zeal.  What then was it?

It was herself!

Margaret was changing!  At times during the past few days I had hardly
known her as the same girl whom I had met at the picnic, and whose
vigils I had shared in the sick-room of her father.  Then, even in her
moments of greatest sorrow or fright or anxiety, she was all life and
thought and keenness.  Now she was generally distraite, and at times in
a sort of negative condition as though her mind--her very being--was not
present.  At such moments she would have full possession of observation
and memory.  She would know and remember all that was going on, and had
gone on around her; but her coming back to her old self had to me
something the sensation of a new person coming into the room.  Up to the
time of leaving London I had been content whenever she was present.  I
had over me that delicious sense of security which comes with the
consciousness that love is mutual.  But now doubt had taken its place.
I never knew whether the personality present was my Margaret--the old
Margaret whom I had loved at the first glance--or the other new Margaret,
whom I hardly understood, and whose intellectual aloofness made an
impalpable barrier between us.  Sometimes she would become, as it were,
awake all at once. At such times, though she would say to me sweet and
pleasant things which she had often said before, she would seem most
unlike herself.  It was almost as if she was speaking parrot-like or at
dictation of one who could read words or acts, but not thoughts.  After
one or two experiences of this kind, my own doubting began to make a
barrier; for I could not speak with the ease and freedom which were
usual to me.  And so hour by hour we drifted apart.  Were it not for the
few odd moments when the old Margaret was back with me full of her charm
I do not know what would have happened.  As it was, each such moment
gave me a fresh start and kept my love from changing.

I would have given the world for a confidant; but this was impossible.
How could I speak a doubt of Margaret to anyone, even her father!  How
could I speak a doubt to Margaret, when Margaret herself was the theme!
I could only endure--and hope. And of the two the endurance was the
lesser pain.

I think that Margaret must have at times felt that there was some cloud
between us, for towards the end of the first day she began to shun me a
little; or perhaps it was that she had become more diffident that usual
about me.  Hitherto she had sought every opportunity of being with me,
just as I had tried to be with her; so that now any avoidance, one of
the other, made a new pain to us both.

On this day the household seemed very still.  Each one of us was about
his own work, or occupied with his own thoughts.  We only met at meal
times; and then, though we talked, all seemed more or less preoccupied.
There was not in the house even the stir of the routine of service.  The
precaution of Mr. Trelawny in having three rooms prepared for each of us
had rendered servants unnecessary.  The dining-room was solidly prepared
with cooked provisions for several days.  Towards evening I went out by
myself for a stroll.  I had looked for Margaret to ask her to come with
me; but when I found her, she was in one of her apathetic moods, and the
charm of her presence seemed lost to me.  Angry with myself, but unable
to quell my own spirit of discontent, I went out alone over the rocky
headland.

On the cliff, with the wide expanse of wonderful sea before me, and no
sound but the dash of waves below and the harsh screams of the seagulls
above, my thoughts ran free.  Do what I would, they returned
continuously to one subject, the solving of the doubt that was upon me.
Here in the solitude, amid the wide circle of Nature's foce and strife,
my mind began to work truly.  Unconsciously I found myself asking a
question which I would not allow myself to answer.  At last the
persistence of a mind working truly prevailed; I found myself face to
face with my doubt.  The habit of my life began to assert itself, and I
analysed the evidence before me.

It was so startling that I had to force myself into obedience to logical
effort.  My starting-place was this:  Margaret was changed--in what way,
and by what means? Was it her character, or her mind, or her nature? for
her physical appearance remained the same.  I began to group all that I
had ever heard of her, beginning at her birth.

It was strange at the very first.  She had been, according to Corbeck's
statement, born of a dead mother during the time that her father and his
friend were in a trance in the tomb at Aswan.  That trance was
presumably effected by a woman; a woman mummied, yet preserving as we
had every reason to believe from after experience, an astral body
subject to a free will and an active intelligence.  With that astral
body, space ceased to exist.  The vast distance between London and Aswan
became as naught; and whatever power of necromancy the Sorceress had
might have been exercised over the dead mother, and possibly the dead
child.

The dead child!  Was it possible that the child was dead and was made
alive again? Whence then came the animating spirit--the soul?  Logic was
pointing the way to me now with a vengeance!

If the Egyptian belief was true for Egyptians, then the ""Ka"" of the dead
Queen and her ""Khu"" could animate what she might choose.  In such case
Margaret would not be an individual at all, but simply a phase of Queen
Tera herself; an astral body obedient to her will!

Here I revolted against logic.  Every fibre of my being resented such a
conclusion. How could I believe that there was no Margaret at all; but
just an animated image, used by the Double of a woman of forty centuries
ago to its own ends . . . ! Somehow, the outlook was brighter to me now,
despite the new doubts.

At least I had Margaret!

Back swung the logical pendulum again.  The child then was not dead.  If
so, had the Sorceress had anything to do with her birth at all?  It was
evident--so I took it again from Corbeck--that there was a strange
likeness between Margaret and the pictures of Queen Tera.  How could
this be?  It could not be any birth-mark reproducing what had been in
the mother's mind; for Mrs. Trelawny had never seen the pictures.  Nay,
even her father had not seen them till he had found his way into the
tomb only a few days before her birth.  This phase I could not get rid
of so easily as the last; the fibres of my being remained quiet.  There
remained to me the horror of doubt.  And even then, so strange is the
mind of man, Doubt itself took a concrete image; a vast and impenetrable
gloom, through which flickered irregularly and spasmodically tiny points
of evanescent light, which seemed to quicken the darkness into a
positive existence.

The remaining possibility of relations between Margaret and the mummied
Queen was, that in some occult way the Sorceress had power to change
places with the other.  This view of things could not be so lightly
thrown aside.  There were too many suspicious circumstances to warrant
this, now that my attention was fixed on it and my intelligence
recognised the possibility.  Hereupon there began to come into my mind
all the strange incomprehensible matters which had whirled through our
lives in the last few days.  At first they all crowded in upon me in a
jumbled mass; but again the habit of mind of my working life prevailed,
and they took order.  I found it now easier to control myself; for there
was something to grasp, some work to be done; though it was of a sorry
kind, for it was or might be antagonistic to Margaret.  But Margaret was
herself at stake!  I was thinking of her and fighting for her; and yet
if I were to work in the dark, I might be even harmful to her.  My first
weapon in her defence was truth.  I must know and understand; I might
then be able to act.  Certainly, I could not act beneficently without a
just conception and recognition of the facts.  Arranged in order these
were as follows:

Firstly:  the strange likeness of Queen Tera to Margaret who had been
born in another country a thousand miles away, where her mother could
not possibly have had even a passing knowledge of her appearance.

Secondly:  the disappearance of Van Huyn's book when I had read up to
the description of the Star Ruby.

Thirdly:  the finding of the lamps in the boudoir.  Tera with her astral
body could have unlocked the door of Corbeck's room in the hotel, and
have locked it again after her exit with the lamps.  She could in the
same way have opened the window, and put the lamps in the boudoir.  It
need not have been that Margaret in her own person should have had any
hand in this; but--but it was at least strange.

Fourthly:  here the suspicions of the Detective and the Doctor came back
to me with renewed force, and with a larger understanding.

Fifthly:  there were the occasions on which Margaret foretold with
accuracy the coming occasions of quietude, as though she had some
conviction or knowledge of the intentions of the astral-bodied Queen.

Sixthly:  there was her suggestion of the finding of the Ruby which her
father had lost.  As I thought now afresh over this episode in the light
of suspicion in which her own powers were involved, the only conclusion
I could come to was--always supposing that the theory of the Queen's
astral power was correct--that Queen Tera being anxious that all should
go well in the movement from London to Kyllion had in her own way taken
the Jewel from Mr. Trelawny's pocket-book, finding it of some use in her
supernatural guardianship of the journey.  Then in some mysterious way
she had, through Margaret, made the suggestion of its loss and finding.

Seventhly, and lastly, was the strange dual existence which Margaret
seemed of late to be leading; and which in some way seemed a consequence
or corollary of all that had gone before.

The dual existence!  This was indeed the conclusion which overcame all
difficulties and reconciled opposites.  If indeed Margaret were not in
all ways a free agent, but could be compelled to speak or act as she
might be instructed; or if her whole being could be changed for another
without the possibility of any one noticing the doing of it, then all
things were possible.  All would depend on the spirit of the
individuality by which she could be so compelled.  If this individuality
were just and kind and clean, all might be well.  But if not! . . . The
thought was too awful for words.  I ground my teeth with futile rage, as
the ideas of horrible possibilities swept through me.

Up to this morning Margaret's lapses into her new self had been few and
hardly noticeable, save when once or twice her attitude towards myself
had been marked by a bearing strange to me.  But today the contrary was
the case; and the change presaged badly.  It might be that that other
individuality was of the lower, not of the better sort!  Now that I
thought of it I had reason to fear.  In the history of the mummy, from
the time of Van Huyn's breaking into the tomb, the record of deaths that
we knew of, presumably effected by her will and agency, was a startling
one. The Arab who had stolen the hand from the mummy; and the one who
had taken it from his body.  The Arab chief who had tried to steal the
Jewel from Van Huyn, and whose throat bore the marks of seven fingers.
The two men found dead on the first night of Trelawny's taking away the
sarcophagus; and the three on the return to the tomb.  The Arab who had
opened the secret serdab.  Nine dead men, one of them slain manifestly
by the Queen's own hand!  And beyond this again the several savage
attacks on Mr. Trelawny in his own room, in which, aided by her
Familiar, she had tried to open the safe and to extract the Talisman
jewel.  His device of fastening the key to his wrist by a steel bangle,
though successful in the end, had wellnigh cost him his life.

If then the Queen, intent on her resurrection under her own conditions
had, so to speak, waded to it through blood, what might she not do were
her purpose thwarted?  What terrible step might she not take to effect
her wishes?  Nay, what were her wishes; what was her ultimate purpose?
As yet we had had only Margaret's statement of them, given in all the
glorious enthusiasm of her lofty soul.  In her record there was no
expression of love to be sought or found.  All we knew for certain was
that she had set before her the object of resurrection, and that in it
the North which she had manifestly loved was to have a special part.
But that the resurrection was to be accomplished in the lonely tomb in
the Valley of the Sorcerer was apparent.  All preparations had been
carefully made for accomplishment from within, and for her ultimate exit
in her new and living form. The sarcophagus was unlidded.  The oil jars,
though hermetically sealed, were to be easily opened by hand; and in
them provision was made for shrinkage through a vast period of time.
Even flint and steel were provided for the production of flame.  The
Mummy Pit was left open in violation of usage; and beside the stone door
on the cliff side was fixed an imperishable chain by which she might in
safety descend to earth. But as to what her after intentions were we had
no clue.  If it was that she meant to begin life again as a humble
individual, there was something so noble in the thought that it even
warmed my heart to her and turned my wishes to her success.

The very idea seemed to endorse Margaret's magnificent tribute to her
purpose, and helped to calm my troubled spirit.

Then and there, with this feeling strong upon me, I determined to warn
Margaret and her father of dire possibilities; and to await, as well
content as I could in my ignorance, the development of things over which
I had no power.

I returned to the house in a different frame of mind to that in which I
had left it; and was enchanted to find Margaret--the old Margaret--
waiting for me.

After dinner, when I was alone for a time with the father and daughter,
I opened the subject, though with considerable hesitation:

""Would it not be well to take every possible precaution, in case the
Queen may not wish what we are doing, with regard to what may occur
before the Experiment; and at or after her waking, if it comes off?""
Margaret's answer came back quickly; so quickly that I was convinced she
must have had it ready for some one:

""But she does approve!  Surely it cannot be otherwise.  Father is doing,
with all his brains and all his energy and all his great courage, just
exactly what the great Queen had arranged!""

""But,"" I answered, ""that can hardly be.  All that she arranged was in a
tomb high up in a rock, in a desert solitude, shut away from the world
by every conceivable means. She seems to have depended on this isolation
to insure against accident.  Surely, here in another country and age,
with quite different conditions, she may in her anxiety make mistakes
and treat any of you--of us--as she did those others in times gone past.
Nine men that we know of have been slain by her own hand or by her
instigation.  She can be remorseless if she will.""  It did not strike me
till afterwards when I was thinking over this conversation, how
thoroughly I had accepted the living and conscious condition of Queen
Tera as a fact.  Before I spoke, I had feared I might offend Mr.
Trelawny; but to my pleasant surprise he smiled quite genially as he
answered me:

""My dear fellow, in a way you are quite right.  The Queen did
undoubtedly intend isolation; and, all told, it would be best that her
experiment should be made as she arranged it.  But just think, that
became impossible when once the Dutch explorer had broken into her tomb.
That was not my doing.  I am innocent of it, though it was the cause of
my setting out to rediscover the sepulchre.  Mind, I do not say for a
moment that I would not have done just the same as Van Huyn.  I went
into the tomb from curiosity; and I took away what I did, being fired
with the zeal of acquisitiveness which animates the collector.  But,
remember also, that at this time I did not know of the Queen's intention
of resurrection; I had no idea of the completeness of her preparations.
All that came long afterwards.  But when it did come, I have done all
that I could to carry out her wishes to the full.  My only fear is that
I may have misinterpreted some of her cryptic instructions, or have
omitted or overlooked something.  But of this I am certain; I have left
undone nothing that I can imagine right to be done; and I have done
nothing that I know of to clash with Queen Tera's arrangement.  I want
her Great Experiment to succeed.  To this end I have not spared labour
or time or money--or myself.  I have endured hardship, and braved danger.
All my brains; all my knowledge and learning, such as they are; all my
endeavours such as they can be, have been, are, and shall be devoted to
this end, till we either win or lose the great stake that we play for.""

""The great stake?"" I repeated; ""the resurrection of the woman, and the
woman's life? The proof that resurrection can be accomplished; by
magical powers; by scientific knowledge; or by use of some force which
at present the world does not know?""

Then Mr. Trelawny spoke out the hopes of his heart which up to now he
had indicated rather than expressed.  Once or twice I had heard Corbeck
speak of the fiery energy of his youth; but, save for the noble words of
Margaret when she had spoken of Queen Tera's hope--which coming from his
daughter made possible a belief that her power was in some sense due to
heredity--I had seen no marked sign of it.  But now his words, sweeping
before them like a torrent all antagonistic thought, gave me a new idea
of the man.

""'A woman's life!'  What is a woman's life in the scale with what we
hope for!  Why, we are risking already a woman's life; the dearest life
to me in all the world, and that grows more dear with every hour that
passes.  We are risking as well the lives of four men; yours and my own,
as well as those two others who have been won to our confidence.  'The
proof that resurrection can be accomplished!'  That is much.  A
marvellous thing in this age of science, and the scepticism that
knowledge makes. But life and resurrection are themselves but items in
what may be won by the accomplishment of this Great Experiment.  Imagine
what it will be for the world of thought--the true world of human
progress--the veritable road to the Stars, the itur ad astra of the
Ancients--if there can come back to us out of the unknown past one who
can yield to us the lore stored in the great Library of Alexandria, and
lost in its consuming flames.  Not only history can be set right, and
the teachings of science made veritable from their beginnings; but we
can be placed on the road to the knowledge of lost arts, lost learning,
lost sciences, so that our feet may tread on the indicated path to their
ultimate and complete restoration.  Why, this woman can tell us what the
world was like before what is called 'the Flood'; can give us the origin
of that vast astounding myth; can set the mind back to the consideration
of things which to us now seem primeval, but which were old stories
before the days of the Patriarchs.  But this is not the end!  No, not
even the beginning!  If the story of this woman be all that we think--
which some of us most firmly believe; if her powers and the restoration
of them prove to be what we expect, why, then we may yet achieve a
knowledge beyond what our age has ever known--beyond what is believed
today possible for the children of men.  If indeed this resurrection can
be accomplished, how can we doubt the old knowledge, the old magic, the
old belief! And if this be so, we must take it that the 'Ka' of this
great and learned Queen has won secrets of more than mortal worth from
her surroundings amongst the stars. This woman in her life voluntarily
went down living to the grave, and came back again, as we learn from the
records in her tomb; she chose to die her mortal death whilst young, so
that at her resurrection in another age, beyond a trance of countless
magnitude, she might emerge from her tomb in all the fulness and
splendour of her youth and power.  Already we have evidence that though
her body slept in patience through those many centuries, her
intelligence never passed away, that her resolution never flagged, that
her will remained supreme; and, most important of all, that her memory
was unimpaired.  Oh, what possibilities are there in the coming of such
a being into our midst!  One whose history began before the concrete
teaching of our Bible; whose experiences were antecedent to the
formulation of the Gods of Greece; who can link together the Old and the
New, Earth and Heaven, and yield to the known worlds of thought and
physical existence the mystery of the Unknown--of the Old World in its
youth, and of Worlds beyond our ken!""

He paused, almost overcome.  Margaret had taken his hand when he spoke
of her being so dear to him, and held it hard.  As he spoke she
continued to hold it.  But there came over her face that change which I
had so often seen of late; that mysterious veiling of her own
personality which gave me the subtle sense of separation from her.  In
his impassioned vehemence her father did not notice; but when he stopped
she seemed all at once to be herself again.  In her glorious eyes came
the added brightness of unshed tears; and with a gesture of passionate
love and admiration, she stooped and kissed her father's hand.  Then,
turning to me, she too spoke:

""Malcolm, you have spoken of the deaths that came from the poor Queen;
or rather that justly came from meddling with her arrangements and
thwarting her purpose. Do you not think that, in putting it as you have
done, you have been unjust?  Who would not have done just as she did?
Remember she was fighting for her life!  Ay, and for more than her life!
For life, and love, and all the glorious possibilities of that dim
future in the unknown world of the North which had such enchanting hopes
for her!  Do you not think that she, with all the learning of her time,
and with all the great and resistless force of her mighty nature, had
hopes of spreading in a wider way the lofty aspirations of her soul!
That she hoped to bring to the conquering of unknown worlds, and using
to the advantage of her people, all that she had won from sleep and
death and time; all of which might and could have been frustrated by the
ruthless hand of an assassin or a thief.  Were it you, in such case
would you not struggle by all means to achieve the object of your life
and hope; whose possibilities grew and grew in the passing of those
endless years?  Can you think that that active brain was at rest during
all those weary centuries, whilst her free soul was flitting from world
to world amongst the boundless regions of the stars? Had these stars in
their myriad and varied life no lessons for her; as they have had for us
since we followed the glorious path which she and her people marked for
us, when they sent their winged imaginations circling amongst the lamps
of the night!""

Here she paused.  She too was overcome, and the welling tears ran down
her cheeks. I was myself more moved than I can say.  This was indeed my
Margaret; and in the consciousness of her presence my heart leapt.  Out
of my happiness came boldness, and I dared to say now what I had feared
would be impossible:  something which would call the attention of Mr.
Trelawny to what I imagined was the dual existence of his daughter.  As
I took Margaret's hand in mine and kissed it, I said to her father:

""Why, sir! she couldn't speak more eloquently if the very spirit of
Queen Tera was with her to animate her and suggest thoughts!""

Mr. Trelawny's answer simply overwhelmed me with surprise.  It
manifested to me that he too had gone through just such a process of
thought as my own.

""And what if it was; if it is!  I know well that the spirit of her
mother is within her.  If in addition there be the spirit of that great
and wondrous Queen, then she would be no less dear to me, but doubly
dear!  Do not have fear for her, Malcolm Ross; at least have no more
fear than you may have for the rest of us!""  Margaret took up the theme,
speaking so quickly that her words seemed a continuation of her
father's, rather than an interruption of them.

""Have no special fear for me, Malcolm.  Queen Tera knows, and will offer
us no harm. I know it!  I know it, as surely as I am lost in the depth
of my own love for you!""

There was something in her voice so strange to me that I looked quickly
into her eyes.  They were bright as ever, but veiled to my seeing the
inward thought behind them as are the eyes of a caged lion.

Then the two other men came in, and the subject changed.





Chapter XIX
The Lesson of the ""Ka""

That night we all went to bed early.  The next night would be an anxious
one, and Mr. Trelawny thought that we should all be fortified with what
sleep we could get. The day, too, would be full of work.  Everything in
connection with the Great Experiment would have to be gone over, so that
at the last we might not fail from any unthought-of flaw in our working.
We made, of course, arrangements for summoning aid in case such should
be needed; but I do not think that any of us had any real apprehension
of danger.  Certainly we had no fear of such danger from violence as we
had had to guard against in London during Mr. Trelawny's long trance.

For my own part I felt a strange sense of relief in the matter.  I had
accepted Mr. Trelawny's reasoning that if the Queen were indeed such as
we surmised--such as indeed we now took for granted--there would not be
any opposition on her part; for we were carrying out her own wishes to
the very last.  So far I was at ease--far more at ease than earlier in
the day I should have thought possible; but there were other sources of
trouble which I could not blot out from my mind.  Chief amongst them was
Margaret's strange condition.  If it was indeed that she had in her own
person a dual existence, what might happen when the two existences
became one? Again, and again, and again I turned this matter over in my
mind, till I could have shrieked out in nervous anxiety.  It was no
consolation to me to remember that Margaret was herself satisfied, and
her father acquiescent.  Love is, after all, a selfish thing; and it
throws a black shadow on anything between which and the light it stands.
I seemed to hear the hands go round the dial of the clock; I saw
darkness turn to gloom, and gloom to grey, and grey to light without
pause or hindrance to the succession of my miserable feelings.  At last,
when it was decently possible without the fear of disturbing others, I
got up.  I crept along the passage to find if all was well with the
others; for we had arranged that the door of each of our rooms should be
left slightly open so that any sound of disturbance would be easily and
distinctly heard.

One and all slept; I could hear the regular breathing of each, and my
heart rejoiced that this miserable night of anxiety was safely passed.
As I knelt in my own room in a burst of thankful prayer, I knew in the
depths of my own heart the measure of my fear.  I found my way out of
the house, and went down to the water by the long stairway cut in the
rock.  A swim in the cool bright sea braced my nerves and made me my old
self again.

As I came back to the top of the steps I could see the bright sunlight,
rising from behind me, turning the rocks across the bay to glittering
gold.  And yet I felt somehow disturbed.  It was all too bright; as it
sometimes is before the coming of a storm.  As I paused to watch it, I
felt a soft hand on my shoulder; and, turning, found Margaret close to
me; Margaret as bright and radiant as the morning glory of the sun! It
was my own Margaret this time!  My old Margaret, without alloy of any
other; and I felt that, at least, this last and fatal day was well
begun.

But alas! the joy did not last.  When we got back to the house from a
stroll around the cliffs, the same old routine of yesterday was resumed:
gloom and anxiety, hope, high spirits, deep depression, and apathetic
aloofness.

But it was to be a day of work; and we all braced ourselves to it with
an energy which wrought its own salvation.

After breakfast we all adjourned to the cave, where Mr. Trelawny went
over, point by point, the position of each item of our paraphernalia.
He explained as he went on why each piece was so placed.  He had with
him the great rools of paper with the measured plans and the signs and
drawings which he had had made from his own and Corbeck's rough notes.
As he had told us, these contained the whole of the hieroglyphics on
walls and ceilings and floor of the tomb in the Valley of the Sorcerer.
Even had not the measurements, made to scale, recorded the position of
each piece of furniture, we could have eventually placed them by a study
of the cryptic writings and symbols.

Mr. Trelawny explained to us certain other things, not laid down on the
chart.  Such as, for instance, that the hollowed part of the table was
exactly fitted to the bottom of the Magic Coffer, which was therefore
intended to be placed on it.  The respective legs of this table were
indicated by differently shaped uraei outlined on the floor, the head of
each being extended in the direction of the similar uraeus twined round
the Also that the mummy, when laid on the raised portion in the bottom
of the sarcophagus, seemingly made to fit the form, would lie head to
the West and feet to the East, thus receiving the natural earth
currents.  ""If this be intended,"" he said, ""as I presume it is, I gather
that the force to be used has something to do with magnetism or
electricity, or both.  It may be, of course, that some other force,
such, for instance, as that emanating from radium, is to be employed.  I
have experimented with the latter, but only in such small quantity as I
could obtain; but so far as I can ascertain the stone of the Coffer is
absolutely impervious to its influence.  There must be some such
unsusceptible substances in nature.  Radium does not seemingly manifest
itself when distributed through pitchblende; and there are doubtless
other such substances in which it can be imprisoned.  Possibly these may
belong to that class of ""inert"" elements discovered or isolated by Sir
William Ramsay.  It is therefore possible that in this Coffer, made from
an aerolite and therefore perhaps containing some element unknown in our
world, may be imprisoned some mighty power which is to be released on
its opening.""

This appeared to be an end of this branch of the subject; but as he
still kept the fixed look of one who is engaged in a theme we all waited
in silence.  After a pause he went on:

""There is one thing which has up to now, I confess, puzzled me.  It may
not be of prime importance; but in a matter like this, where all is
unknown, we must take it that everything is important.  I cannot think
that in a matter worked out with such extraordinary scrupulosity such a
thing should be overlooked.  As you may see by the ground-plan of the
tomb the sarcophagus stands near the north wall, with the Magic Coffer
to the south of it.  The space covered by the former is left quite bare
of symbol or ornamentation of any kind.  At the first glance this would
seem to imply that the drawings had been made after the sarcophagus had
been put into its place.  But a more minute examination will show that
the symbolisation on the floor is so arranged that a definite effect is
produced.  See, here the writings run in correct order as though they
had jumped across the gap.  It is only from certain effects that it
becomes clear that there is a meaning of some kind.  What that meaning
may be is what we want to know.  Look at the top and bottom of the
vacant space, which lies West and East corresponding to the head and
foot of the sarcophagus.  In both are duplications of the same
symbolisation, but so arranged that the parts of each one of them are
integral portions of some other writing running crosswise.  It is only
when we get a coup d'oeil from either the head or the foot that you
recognise that there are symbolisations.  See! they are in triplicate at
the corners and the centre of both top and bottom.  In every case there
is a sun cut in half by the line of the sarcophagus, as by the horizon.
Close behind each of these and faced away from it, as though in some way
dependent on it, is the vase which in hieroglyphic writing symbolises
the heart--'Ab' the Egyptians called it.  Beyond each of these again is
the figure of a pair of widespread arms turned upwards from the elbow;
this is the determinative of the 'Ka' or 'Double'.  But its relative
position is different at top and bottom.  At the head of the sarcophagus
the top of the 'Ka' is turned towards the mouth of the vase, but at the
foot the extended arms point away from it.

""The symbolisation seems to mean that during the passing of the Sun from
West to East--from sunset to sunrise, or through the Under World,
otherwise night--the Heart, which is material even in the tomb and cannot
leave it, simply revolves, so that it can always rest on 'Ra' the
Sun-God, the origin of all good; but that the Double, which represents
the active principle, goes whither it will, the same by night as by day.
If this be correct it is a warning--a caution--a reminder that the
consciousness of the mummy does not rest but is to be reckoned with.

""Or it may be intended to convey that after the particular night of the
resurrection, the 'Ka' would leave the heart altogether, thus typifying
that in her resurrection the Queen would be restored to a lower and
purely physical existence.  In such case what would become of her memory
and the experiences of her wide-wandering soul?  The chiefest value of
her resurrection would be lost to the world!  This, however, does not
alarm me.  It is only guess-work after all, and is contradictory to the
intellectual belief of the Egyptian theology, that the 'Ka' is an
essential portion of humanity.""  He paused and we all waited.  The
silence was broken by Doctor Winchester:

""But would not all this imply that the Queen feared intrusion of her
tomb?""  Mr. Trelawny smiled as he answered:

""My dear sir, she was prepared for it.  The grave robber is no modern
application of endeavour; he was probably known in the Queen's own
dynasty.  Not only was she prepared for intrusion, but, as shown in
several ways, she expected it.  The hiding of the lamps in the serdab,
and the institution of the avenging 'treasurer' shows that there was
defence, positive as well as negative.  Indeed, from the many
indications afforded in the clues laid out with the most consummated
thought, we may almost gather that she entertained it as a possibility
that others--like ourselves, for instance--might in all seriousness
undertake the work which she had made ready for her own hands when the
time should have come.  This very matter that I have been speaking of is
an instance.  The clue is intended for seeing eyes!""

Again we were silent.  It was Margaret who spoke:

""Father, may I have that chart?  I should like to study it during the
day!""

""Certainly, my dear!"" answered Mr. Trelawny heartily, as he handed it to
her.  He resumed his instructions in a different tone, a more matter-of-
fact one suitable to a practical theme which had no mystery about it:

""I think you had better all understand the working of the electric light
in case any sudden contingency should arise.  I dare say you have
noticed that we have a complete supply in every part of the house, so
that there need not be a dark corner anywhere.  This I had specially
arranged.  It is worked by a set of turbines moved by the flowing and
ebbing tide, after the manner of the turbines at Niagara.  I hope by
this means to nullify accident and to have without fail a full supply
ready at any time. Come with me and I will explain the system of
circuits, and point out to you the taps and the fuses.""  I could not but
notice, as we went with him all over the house, how absolutely complete
the system was, and how he had guarded himself against any disaster that
human thought could foresee.

But out of the very completeness came a fear!  In such an enterprise as
ours the bounds of human thought were but narrow.  Beyond it lay the
vast of Divine wisdom, and Divine power!

When we came back to the cave, Mr. Trelawny took up another theme:

""We have now to settle definitely the exact hour at which the Great
Experiment is to be made.  So far as science and mechanism go, if the
preparations are complete, all hours are the same.  But as we have to
deal with preparations made by a woman of extraordinarily subtle mind,
and who had full belief in magic and had a cryptic meaning in
everything, we should place ourselves in her position before deciding.
It is now manifest that the sunset has an important place in the
arrangements.  As those suns, cut so mathematically by the edge of the
sarcophagus, were arranged of full design, we must take our cue from
this.  Again, we find all along that the number seven has had an
important bearing on every phase of the Queen's thought and reasoning
and action.  The logical result is that the seventh hour after sunset
was the time fixed on.  This is borne out by the fact that on each of
the occasions when action was taken in my house, this was the time
chosen.  As the sun sets tonight in Cornwall at eight, our hour is to
be three in the morning!""  He spoke in a matter-of-fact way, though
with great gravity; but there was nothing of mystery in his word or
manner.  Still, we were all impressed to a remarkable degree.  I could
see this in the other men by the pallor that came on some of their
faces, and by the stillness and unquestioning silence with which the
decision was received.  The only one who remained in any way at ease was
Margaret, who had lapsed into one of her moods of abstraction, but who
seemed to wake up to a note of gladness.  Her father, who was watching
her intently, smiled; her mood was to him a direct confirmation of his
theory.

For myself I was almost overcome.  The definite fixing of the hour
seemed like the voice of Doom.  When I think of it now, I can realise
how a condemned man feels at his sentence, or at the sounding of the
last hour he is to hear.

There could be no going back now!  We were in the hands of God!

The hands of God . . . !  And yet . . . !  What other forces were
arrayed? . . . What would become of us all, poor atoms of earthly dust
whirled in the wind which comesth whence and goeth whither no man may
know.  It was not for myself . . . Margaret . . . !

I was recalled by Mr. Trelawny's firm voice:

""Now we shall see to the lamps and finish our preparations.""
Accordingly we set to work, and under his supervision made ready the
Egyptian lamps, seeing that they were well filled with the cedar oil,
and that the wicks were adjusted and in good order.  We lighted and
tested them one by one, and left them ready so that they would light at
once and evenly.  When this was done we had a general look round; and
fixed all in readiness for our work at night.

All this had taken time, and we were I think all surprised when as we
emerged from the cave we heard the great clock in the hall chime four.

We had a late lunch, a thing possible without trouble in the present
state of our commissariat arrangements.  Afte it, by Mr. Trelawny's
advice, we separated; each to prepare in our own way for the strain of
the coming night.  Margaret looked pale and somewhat overwrought, so I
advised her to lie down and try to sleep.  She promised that she would.
The abstraction which had been upon her fitfully all day lifted for the
time; with all her old sweetness and loving delicacy she kissed me
good-bye for the present!  With the sense of happiness which this gave
me I went out for a walk on the cliffs.  I did not want to think; and I
had an instinctive feeling that fresh air and God's sunlight, and the
myriad beauties of the works of His hand would be the best preparation
of fortitude for what was to come.

When I got back, all the party were assembling for a late tea.  Coming
fresh from the exhilaration of nature, it struck me as almost comic that
we, who were nearing the end of so strange--almost monstrous--an
undertaking, should be yet bound by the needs and habits of our lives.

All the men of the party were grave; the time of seclusion, even if it
had given them rest, had also given opportunity for thought.  Margaret
was bright, almost buoyant; but I missed about her something of her
usual spontaneity.  Towards myself there was a shadowy air of reserve,
which brought back something of my suspicion.  When tea was over, she
went out of the room; but returned in a minute with the roll of drawing
which she had taken with her earlier in the day.  Coming close to Mr.
Trelawny, she said:

""Father, I have been carefully considering what you said today about
the hidden meaning of those suns and hearts and 'Ka's', and I have been
examining the drawings again.""

""And with what result, my child?"" asked Mr. Trelawny eagerly.

""There is another reading possible!""

""And that?""  His voice was now tremulous with anxiety.  Margaret spoke
with a strange ring in her voice; a ring that cannot be, unless there is
the consciousness of truth behind it:

""It means that at the sunset the 'Ka' is to enter the 'Ab'; and it is
only at the sunrise that it will leave it!""

""Go on!"" said her father hoarsely.

""It means that for this night the Queen's Double, which is otherwise
free, will remain in her heart, which is mortal and cannot leave its
prison-place in the mummy-shrouding.  It means that when the sun has
dropped into the sea, Queen Tera will cease to exist as a conscious
power, till sunrise; unless the Great Experiment can recall her to
waking life.  It means that there will be nothing whatever for you or
others to fear from her in such way as we have all cause to remember.
Whatever change may come from the working of the Great Experiment, there
can come none from the poor, helpless, dead woman who has waited all
those centuries for this night; who has given up to the coming hour all
the freedom of eternity, won in the old way, in hope of a new life in a
new world such as she longed for . . . !""  She stopped suddenly.  As she
had gone on speaking there had come with her words a strange pathetic,
almost pleading, tone which touched me to the quick.  As she stopped, I
could see, before she turned away her head, that her eyes were full of
tears.

For once the heart of her father did not respond to her feeling.  He
looked exultant, but with a grim masterfulness which reminded me of the
set look of his stern face as he had lain in the trance.  He did not
offer any consolation to his daughter in her sympathetic pain.  He only
said:

""We may test the accuracy of your surmise, and of her feeling, when the
time comes!"" Having said so, he went up the stone stairway and into his
own room.  Margaret's face had a troubled look as she gazed after him.

Strangely enough her trouble did not as usual touch me to the quick.

When Mr. Trelawny had gone, silence reigned.  I do not think that any of
us wanted to talk.  Presently Margaret went to her room, and I went out
on the terrace over the sea.  The fresh air and the beauty of all before
helped to restore the good spirits which I had known earlier in the day.
Presently i felt myself actually rejoicing in the belief that the danger
which I had feared from the Queen's violence on the coming night was
obviated.  I believed in Margaret's belief so thoroughly that it did not
occur to me to dispute her reasoning.  In a lofty frame of mind, and
with less anxiety than I had felt for days, I went to my room and lay
down on the sofa.

I was awaked by Corbeck calling to me, hurriedly:

""Come down to the cave as quickly as you can.  Mr. Trelawny wants to see
us all there at once.  Hurry!""

I jumped up and ran down to the cave.  All were there except Margaret,
who came immediately after me carrying Silvio in her arms.  When the cat
saw his old enemy he struggled to get down; but Margaret held him fast
and soothed him.  I looked at my watch.  It was close to eight.

When Margaret was with us her father said directly, with a quiet
insistence which was new to me:

""You believe, Margaret, that Queen Tera has voluntarily undertaken to
give up her freedom for this night?  To become a mummy and nothing more,
till the Experiment has been completed?  To be content that she shall be
powerless under all and any circumstances until after all is over and
the act of resurrection has been accomplished, or the effort has
failed?""  After a pause Margaret answered in a low voice:

""Yes!""

In the pause her whole being, appearance, expression, voice, manner had
changed. Even Silvio noticed it, and with a violent effort wriggled away
from her arms; she did not seem to notice the act.  I expected that the
cat, when he had achieved his freedom, would have attacked the mummy;
but on this occasion he did not.  He seemed too cowed to approach it.
He shrunk away, and with a piteous ""miaou"" came over and rubbed himself
against my ankles.  I took him up in my arms, and he nestled there
content.  Mr. Trelawny spoke again:

""You are sure of what you say!  You believe it with all your soul?""
Margaret's face had lost the abstracted look; it now seemed illuminated
with the devotion of one to whom is given to speak of great things.  She
answered in a voice which, though quiet, vibrated with conviction:

""I know it!  My knowledge is beyond belief!""  Mr. Trelawny spoke again:

""Then you are so sure, that were you Queen Tera herself, you would be
willing to prove it in any way that I might suggest?""

""Yes, any way!"" the answer rang out fearlessly.  He spoke again, in a
voice in which was no note of doubt:

""Even in the abandonment of your Familiar to death--to annihilation.""

She paused, and I could see that she suffered--suffered horribly.  There
was in her eyes a hunted look, which no man can, unmoved, see in the
eyes of his beloved.  I was about to interrupt, when her father's eyes,
glancing round with a fierce determination, met mine.  I stood silent,
almost spellbound; so also the other men. Something was going on before
us which we did not understand!

With a few long strides Mr. Trelawny went to the west side of the cave
and tore back the shutter which obscured the window.  The cool air blew
in, and the sunlight streamed over them both, for Margaret was now by
his side.  He pointed to where the sun was sinking into the sea in a
halo of golden fire, and his face was as set as flint.  In a voice whose
absolute uncompromising hardness I shall hear in my ears at times till
my dying day, he said:

""Choose!  Speak!  When the sun has dipped below the sea, it will be too
late!""  The glory of the dying sun seemed to light up Margaret's face,
till it shone as if lit from within by a noble light, as she answered:

""Even that!""

Then stepping over to where the mummy cat stood on the little table, she
placed her hand on it.  She had now left the sunlight, and the shadows
looked dark and deep over her.  In a clear voice she said:

""Were I Tera, I would say 'Take all I have!  This night is for the Gods
alone!'""

As she spoke the sun dipped, and the cold shadow suddenly fell on us.
We all stood still for a while.  Silvio jumped from my arms and ran over
to his mistress, rearing himself up against her dress as if asking to be
lifted.  He took no notice whatever of the mummy now.

Margaret was glorious with all her wonted sweetness as she said sadly:

""The sun is down, Father!  Shall any of us see it again?  The night of
nights is come!""





Chapter XX
The Great Experiment

If any evidence had been wanted of how absolutely one and all of us had
come to believe in the spiritual existence of the Egyptian Queen, it
would have been found in the change which n a few minutes had been
effected in us by the statement of voluntary negation made, we all
believed, through Margaret.  Despite the coming of the fearful ordeal,
the sense of which it was impossible to forget, we looked and acted as
though a great relief had come to us.  We had indeed lived in such a
state of terrorism during the days when Mr. Trelawny was lying in a
trance that the feeling had bitten deeply into us.  No one knows till he
has experienced it, what it is to be in constant dreadof some unknown
danger which may come at any time and in any form.

The change was manifested in different ways, according to each nature.
Margaret was sad.  Doctor Winchester was in high spirits, and keenly
observant; the process of thought which had served as an antidote to
fear, being now relieved from this duty, added to his intellectual
enthusiasm.  Mr. Corbeck seemed to be in a retrospective rather than a
speculative mood.  I was myself rather inclined to be gay; the relief
from certain anxiety regarding Margaret was sufficient for me for the
time.

As to Mr. Trelawny he seemed less changed than any.  Perhaps this was
only natural, as he had had in his mind the intention for so many years
of doing that in which we were tonight engaged, that any event
connected with it could only seem to him as an episode, a step to the
end.  His was that commanding nature which looks so to the end of an
undertaking that all else is of secondary importance.  Even now, though
his terrible sternness relaxed under the relief from the strain, he
never flagged nor faltered for a moment in his purpose.  He asked us men
to come with him; and going to the hall we presently managed to lower
into the cave an oak table, fairly long and not too wide, which stood
against the wall in the hall.  This we placed under the strong cluster
of electric lights in the middle of the cave.  Margaret looked on for a
while; then all at once her face blanched, and in an agitated voice she
said:

""What are you going to do, Father?""

""To unroll the mummy of the cat!  Queen Tera will not need her Familiar
tonight.  If she should want him, it might be dangerous to us; so we
shall make him safe.  You are not alarmed, dear?""

""Oh no!"" she answered quickly.  ""But I was thinking of my Silvio, and
how I should feel if he had been the mummy that was to be unswathed!""

Mr. Trelawny got knives and scissors ready, and placed the cat on the
table.  It was a grim beginning to our work; and it made my heart sink
when I thought of what might happen in that lonely house in the
mid-gloom of the night.  The sense of loneliness and isolation from the
world was increased by the moaning of the wind which had now risen
ominously, and by the beating of waves on the rocks below.  But we had
too grave a task before us to be swayed by external manifestations:  the
unrolling of the mummy began.

There was an incredible number of bandages; and the tearing sound--they
being stuck fast to each other by bitumen and gums and spices--and the
little cloud of red pungent dust that arose, pressed on the senses of
all of us.  As the last wrappings came away, we saw the animal seated
before us.  He was all hunkered up; his hair and teeth and claws were
complete.  The eyes were closed, but the eyelids had not the fierce look
which I expected.  The whiskers had been pressed down on the side of the
face by the bandaging; but when the pressure ws taken away they stood
out, just as they would have done in life.  He was a magnificent
creature, a tiger-cat of great size.  But as we looked at him, our first
glance of admiration changed to one of fear, and a shudder ran through
each one of us; for here was a confirmation of the fears which we had
endured.

His mouth and his claws were smeared with the dry, red stains of recent
blood!

Doctor Winchester was the first to recover; blood in itself had small
disturbing quality for him.  He had taken out his magnifying-glass and
was examining the stains on the cat's mouth.  Mr. Trelawny breathed
loudly, as though a strain had been taken from him.

""It is as I expected,"" he said.  ""This promises well for what is to
follow.""

By this time Doctor Winchester was looking at the red stained paws.  ""As
I expected!"" he said.  ""He has seven claws, too!""  Opening his
pocket-book, he took out the piece of blotting-paper marked by Silvio's
claws, on which was also marked in pencil a diagram of the cuts made on
Mr. Trelawny's wrist.  He placed the paper under the mummy cat's paw.
The marks fitted exactly.

When we had carefully examined the cat, finding, however, nothing
strange about it but its wonderful preservation, Mr. Trelawny lifted it
from the table.  Margaret started forward, crying out:

""Take care, Father!  Take care!  He may injure you!""

""Not now, my dear!"" he answered as he moved towards the stairway.  Her
face fell. ""Where are you going?"" she asked in a faint voice.

""To the kitchen,"" he answered.  ""Fire will take away all danger for the
future; even an astral body cannot materialise from ashes!""  He signed
to us to follow him.  Margaret turned away with a sob.  I went to her;
but she motioned me back and whispered:

""No, no!  Go with the others.  Father may want you.  Oh! it seems like
murder!  The poor Queen's pet . . . !""  The tears were dropping from
under the fingers that covered her eyes.

In the kitchen was a fire of wood ready laid.  To this Mr. Trelawny
applied a match; in a few seconds the kindling had caught and the flames
leaped.  When the fire was solidly ablaze, he threw the body of the cat
into it.  For a few seconds it lay a dark mass amidst the flames, and
the room was rank with the smell of burning hair.  Then the dry body
caught fire too.  The inflammable substances used in embalming became
new fuel, and the flames roared.  A few minutes of fierce conflagration;
and then we breathed freely.  Queen Tera's Familiar was no more!

When we went back to the cave we found Margaret sitting in the dark.
She had switched off the electric light, and only a faint glow of the
evening light came through the narrow openings.  Her father went quickly
over to her and put his arms round her in a loving protective way.  She
laid her head on his shoulder for a minute and seemed comforted.
Presently she called to me:

""Malcolm, turn up the light!""  I carried out her orders, and could see
that, though she had been crying, her eyes were now dry.  Her father saw
it too and looked glad.  He said to us in a grave tone:

""Now we had better prepare for our great work.  It will not do to leave
anything to the last!""  Margaret must have had a suspicion of what was
coming, for it was with a sinking voice that she asked:

""What are you going to do now?""  Mr. Trelawny too must have had a
suspicion of her feelings, for he answered in a low tone:

""To unroll the mummy of Queen Tera!""  She came close to him and said
pleadingly in a whisper:

""Father, you are not going to unswathe her!  All you men . . . !  And in
the glare of light!""

""But why not, my dear?""

""Just think, Father, a woman!  All alone!  In such a way!  In such a
place!  Oh! it's cruel, cruel!""  She was manifestly much overcome.  Her
cheeks were flaming red, and her eyes were full of indignant tears.  Her
father saw her distress; and, sympathising with it, began to comfort
her.  I was moving off; but he signed to me to stay.  I took it that
after the usual manner of men he wanted help on such an occasion, and
man-like wished to throw on someone else the task of dealing with a
woman in indignant distress.  However, he began to appeal first to her
reason:

""Not a woman, dear; a mummy!  She has been dead nearly five thousand
years!""

""What does that matter?  Sex is not a matter of years!  A woman is a
woman, if she had been dead five thousand centuries!  And you expect her
to arise out of that long sleep!  It could not be real death, if she is
to rise out of it!  You have led me to believe that she will come alive
when the Coffer is opened!""

""I did, my dear; and I believe it!  But if it isn't death that has been
the matter with her all these years, it is something uncommonly like it.
Then again, just think; it was men who embalmed her.  They didn't have
women's rights or lady doctors in ancient Egypt, my dear!  And besides,""
he went on more freely, seeing that she was accepting his argument, if
not yielding to it, ""we men are accustomed to such things.  Corbeck and
I have unrolled a hundred mummies; and there were as many women as men
amongst them.  Doctor Winchester in his work has had to deal with women
as well of men, till custome has made him think nothing of sex.  Even
Ross has in his work as a barrister . . .""  He stopped suddenly.

""You were going to help too!"" she said to me, with an indignant look.

I said nothing; I thought silence was best.  Mr. Trelawny went on
hurriedly; I could see that he was glad of interruption, for the part of
his argument concerning a barrister's work was becoming decidedly weak:

""My child, you will be with us yourself.  Would we do anything which
would hurt or offend you?  Come now! be reasonable!  We are not at a
pleasure party.  We are all grave men, entering gravely on an experiment
which may unfold the wisdom of old times, and enlarge human knowledge
indefinitely; which may put the minds of men on new tracks of thought
and research.  An experiment,"" as he went on his voice deepened, ""which
may be fraught with death to any one of us--to us all!  We know from what
has been, that there are, or may be, vast and unknown dangers ahead of
us, of which none in the house today may ever see the end.  Take it, my
child, that we are not acting lightly; but with all the gravity of
deeply earnest men!  Besides, my dear, whatever feelings you or any of
us may have on the subject, it is necessary for the success of the
experiment to unswathe her.  I think that under any circumstances it
would be necessary to remove the wrappings before she became again a
live human being instead of a spiritualised corpse with an astral body.
Were her original intention carried out, and did she come to new life
within her mummy wrappings, it might be to exchange a coffin for a
grave!  She would die the death of the buried alive!  But now, when she
has voluntarily abandoned for the time her astral power, there can be no
doubt on the subject.""

Margaret's face cleared.  ""All right, Father!"" she said as she kissed
him.  ""But oh! it seems a horrible indignity to a Queen, and a woman.""

I was moving away to the staircase when she called me:

""Where are you going?""  I came back and took her hand and stroked it as
I answered:

""I shall come back when the unrolling is over!""  She looked at me long,
and a faint suggestion of a smile came over her face as she said:

""Perhaps you had better stay, too!  It may be useful to you in your work
as a barrister!""  She smiled out as she met my eyes:  but in an instant
she changed.  Her face grew grave, and deadly white.  In a far away
voice she said:

""Father is right!  It is a terrible occasion; we need all to be serious
over it.  But all the same--nay, for that very reason you had better
stay, Malcolm!  You may be glad, later on, that you were present
tonight!""

My heart sank down, down, at her words; but I thought it better to say
nothing.  Fear was stalking openly enough amongst us already!

By this time Mr. Trelawny, assisted by Mr. Corbeck and Doctor
Winchester, had raised the lid of the ironstone sarcophagus which
contained the mummy of the Queen.  It was a large one; but it was none
too big.  The mummy was both long and broad and high; and was of such
weight that it was no easy task, even for the four of us, to lift it
out.  Under Mr. Trelawny's direction we laid it out on the table
prepared for it.

Then, and then only, did the full horror of the whole thing burst upon
me!  There, in the full glare of the light, the whole material and
sordid side of death seemed staringly real.  The outer wrappings, torn
and loosened by rude touch, and with the colour either darkened by dust
or worn light by friction, seemed creased as by rough treatment; the
jagged edges of the wrapping-cloths looked fringed; the painting was
patchy, and the varnish chipped.  The coverings were evidently many, for
the bulk was great.  But through all, showed that unhidable human
figure, which seems to look more horrible when partially concealed than
at any other time.  What was before us was Death, and nothing else.  All
the romance and sentiment of fancy had disappeared.  The two elder men,
enthusiasts who had often done such work, were not disconcerted; and
Doctor Winchester seemed to hold himself in a business-like attitude, as
if before the operating-table.  But I felt low-spirited, and miserable,
and ashamed; and besides I was pained and alarmed by Margaret's ghastly
pallor.

Then the work began.  The unrolling of the mummy cat had prepared me
somewhat for it; but this was so much larger, and so infinitely more
elaborate, that it seemed a different thing.  Moreover, in addition to
the ever present sense of death and humanity, there was a feeling of
something finer in all this.  The cat had been embalmed with coarser
materials; here, all, when once the outer coverings were removed, was
more delicately done.  It seemed as if only the finest gums and spices
had been used in this embalming.  But there were the same surroundings,
the same attendant red dust and pungent presence of bitumen; there was
the same sound of rending which marked the tearing away of the bandages.
There were an enormous number of these, and their bulk when opened was
great.  As the men unrolled them, I grew more and more excited.  I did
not take a part in it myself; Margaret had looked at me gratefully as I
drew back.  We clasped hands, and held each other hard.  As the
unrolling went on, the wrappings became finer, and the smell less laden
with bitumen, but more pungent.  We all, I think, began to feel it as
though it caught or touched us in some special way.  This, however, did
not interfere with the work; it went on uninterruptedly.  Some of the
inner wrappings bore symbols or pictures. These were done sometimes
wholly in pale green colour, sometimes in many colours; but always with
a prevalence of green.  Now and again Mr. Trelawny or Mr. Corbeck would
point out some special drawing before laying the bandage on the pile
behind them, which kept growing to a monstrous height.

At last we knew that the wrappings were coming to an end.  Already the
proportions were reduced to those of a normal figure of the manifest
height of the Queen, who was more than average height.  And as the end
drew nearer, so Margaret's pallor grew; and her heart beat more and more
wildly, till her breast heaved in a way that frightened me.

Just as her father was taking away the last of the bandages, he happened
to look up and caught the pained and anxious look of her pale face.  He
paused, and taking her concern to be as to the outrage on modesty, said
in a comforting way:

""Do not be uneasy, dear!  See! there is nothing to harm you.  The Queen
has on a robe.--Ay, and a royal robe, too!""

The wrapping was a wide piece the whole length of the body.  It being
removed, a profusely full robe of white linen had appeared, covering the
body from the throat to the feet.

And such linen!  We all bent over to look at it.

Margaret lost her concern, in her woman's interest in fine stuff.  Then
the rest of us looked with admiration; for surely such linen was never
seen by the eyes of our age. It was as fine as the finest silk.  But
never was spun or woven silk which lay in such gracious folds, constrict
though they were by the close wrappings of the mummy cloth, and fixed
into hardness by the passing of thousands of years.

Round the neck it was delicately embroidered in pure gold with tiny
sprays of sycamore; and round the feet, similarly worked, was an endless
line of lotus plants of unequal height, and with all the graceful
abandon of natural growth.

Across the body, but manifestly not surrounding it, was a girdle of
jewels.  A wondrous girdle, which shone and glowed with all the forms
and phases and colours of the sky!

The buckle was a great yellow stone, round of outline, deep and curved,
as if a yielding globe had been pressed down.  It shone and glowed, as
though a veritable sun lay within; the rays of its light seemed to
strike out and illumine all round. Flanking it were two great moonstones
of lesser size, whose glowing, beside the glory of the sunstone, was
like the silvery sheen of moonlight.

And then on either side, linked by golden clasps of exquisite shape, was
a line of flaming jewels, of which the colours seemed to glow.  Each of
these stones seemed to hold a living star, which twinkled in every phase
of changing light.

Margaret raised her hands in ecstasy.  She bent over to examine more
closely; but suddenly drew back and stood fully erect at her grand
height.  She seemed to speak with the conviction of absolute knowledge
as she said:

""That is no cerement!  It was no meant for the clothing of death!  It is
a marriage robe!""

Mr. Trelawny leaned over and touched the linen robe.  He lifted a fold
at the neck, and I knew from the quick intake of his breath that
something had surprised him. He lifted yet a little more; and then he,
too, stood back and pointed, saying:

""Margaret is right!  That dress is not intended to be worn by the dead!
See! her figure is not robed in it.  It is but laid upon her.""  He
lifted the zone of jewels and handed it to Margaret.  Then with both
hands he raised the ample robe, and laid it across the arms which she
extended in a natural impulse.  Things of such beauty were too precious
to be handled with any but the greatest care.

We all stood awed at the beauty of the figure which, save for the face
cloth, now lay completely nude before us.  Mr. Trelawny bent over, and
with hands that trembled slightly, raised this linen cloth which was of
the same fineness as the robe.  As he stood back and the whole glorious
beauty of the Queen was revealed, I felt a rush of shame sweep over me.
It was not right that we should be there, gazing with irreverent eyes on
such unclad beauty:  it was indecent; it was almost sacrilegious! And
yet the white wonder of that beautiful form was something to dream of.
It was not like death at all; it was like a statue carven in ivory by
the hand of a Praxiteles. There was nothing of that horrible shrinkage
which death seems to effect in a moment.  There was none of the wrinkled
toughness which seems to be a leading characteristic of most mummies.
There was not the shrunken attenuation of a body dried in the sand, as I
had seen before in museums.  All the pores of the body seemed to have
been preserved in some wonderful way.  The flesh was full and round, as
in a living person; and the skin was as smooth as satin.  The colour
seemed extraordinary.  It was like ivory, new ivory; except where the
right arm, with shattered, bloodstained wrist and missing hand had lain
bare to exposure in the sarcophagus for so many tens of centuries.

With a womanly impulse; with a mouth that drooped with pity, with eyes
that flashed with anger, and cheeks that flamed, Margaret threw over the
body the beautiful robe which lay across her arm.  Only the face was
then to be seen.  This was more startling even than the body, for it
seemed not dead, but alive.  The eyelids were closed; but the long,
black, curling lashes lay over on the cheeks.  The nostrils, set in
grave pride, seemed to have the repose which, when it is seen in life,
is greater than the repose of death.  The full, red lips, though the
mouth was not open, showed the tiniest white line of pearly teeth
within.  Her hair, glorious in quantity and glossy black as the raven's
wing, was piled in great masses over the white forehead, on which a few
curling tresses strayed like tendrils.  I was amazed at the likeness to
Margaret, though I had had my mind prepared for this by Mr. Corbeck's
quotation of her father's statement.  This woman--I could not think of
her as a mummy or a corpse--was the image of Margaret as my eyes had
first lit on her.  The likeness was increased by the jewelled ornament
which she wore in her hair, the ""Disk and Plumes"", such as Margaret,
too, had worn.  It, too, was a glorious jewel; one noble pearl of
moonlight lustre, flanked by carven pieces of moonstone.

Mr. Trelawny was overcome as he looked.  He quite broke down; and when
Margaret flew to him and held him close in her arms and comforted him, I
heard him murmur brokenly:

""It looks as if you were dead, my child!""

There was a long silence.  I could hear without the roar of the wind,
which was now risen to a tempest, and the furius dashing of the waves
far below.  Mr. Trelawny's voice broke the spell:

""Later on we must try and find out the process of embalming.  It is not
like any that I know.  There does not seem to have been any opening cut
for the withdrawing of the viscera and organs, which apparently remain
intact within the body.  Then, again, there is no moisture in the flesh;
but its place is supplied with something else, as though wax or stearine
had been conveyed into the veins by some subtle process.  I wonder could
it be possible that at that time they could have used paraffin.  It
might have been, by some process that we know not, pumped into the
veins, where it hardened!""

Margaret, having thrown a white sheet over the Queen's body, asked us to
bring it to her own room, where we laid it on her bed.  Then she sent us
away, saying:

""Leave her alone with me.  There are still many hours to pass, and I do
not like to leave her lying there, all stark in the glare of light.
This may be the Bridal she prepared for--the Bridal of Death; and at
least she shall wear her pretty robes.""

When presently she brought me back to her room, the dead Queen was
dressed in the robe of fine linen with the embroidery of gold; and all
her beautiful jewels were in place.  Candles were lit around her, and
white flowers lay upon her breast.

Hand in hand we stood looking at her for a while.  Then with a sigh,
Margaret covered her with one of her own snowy sheets.  She turned away;
and after softly closing the door of the room, went back with me to the
others who had now come into the dining room.  Here we all began to talk
over the things that had been, and that were to be.

Now and again I could feel that one or other of us was forcing
conversation, as if we were not sure of ourselves.  The long wait was
beginning to tell on our nerves.  It was apparent to me that Mr.
Trelawny had suffered in that strange trance more than we suspected, or
than he cared to show.  True, his will and his determination were as
strong as ever; but the purely physical side of him had been weakened
somewhat.  It was indeed only natural that it should be.  No man can go
through a period of four days of absolute negation of life without being
weakened by it somehow.

As the hours crept by, the time passed more and more slowly.  The other
men seemed to get unconsciously a little drowsy.  I wondered if in the
case of Mr. Trelawny and Mr. Corbeck, who had already been under the
hypnotic influence of the Queen, the same dormance was manifesting
itself.  Doctor Winchester had periods of distraction which grew longer
and more frequent as the time wore on.

As to Margaret, the suspense told on her exceedingly, as might have been
expected in the case of a woman.  She grew paler and paler still; till
at last about midnight, I began to be seriously alarmed about her.  I
got her to come into the library with me, and tried to make her lie down
on a sofa for a little while.  As Mr. Trelawny had decided that the
experiment was to be made exactly at the seventh hour after sunset, it
would be as nearly as possible three o'clock in the morning when the
great trial should be made.  Even allowing a whole hour for the final
preparations, we had still two hours of waiting to go through, and I
promised faithfully to watch her and to awake her at any time she might
name.  She would not hear of it, however.  She thanked me sweetly and
smiled at me as she did so; but she assured me that she was not sleepy,
and that she was quite able to bear up.  That it was only the suspense
and excitement of waiting that made her pale.  I agreed perforce; but I
kept her talking of many things in the library for more than an hour; so
that at last, when she insisted on going back to her father's room I
felt that I had at least done something to help her pass the time.

We found the three men sitting patiently in silence.  With manlike
fortitude they were content to be still when they felt they had done 
all in their power.  

And so we waited.

The striking of two o'clock seemed to freshen us all up.  Whatever 
shadows had been settling over us during the long hours preceding 
seemed to lift at once, and we all went about our separate duties 
alert and with alacrity.  We looked first to the windows to see that 
they were closed; for now the storm raged so fiercely that we feared 
it might upset our plans which, after all, were based on perfect 
stillness.  Then we got ready our respirators to put them on when 
the time should be close at hand.  We had from the first arranged to 
use them, for we did not know whether some noxious fume might not 
come from the Magic Coffer when it should be opened.  Somehow it 
never seemed to occur to any of us that there was any doubt as to 
its opening.

Then, under Margaret's guidance, we carried the body of Queen Tera, 
still clad in her Bridal robes, from her room into the cavern.

It was a strange sight, and a strange experience.  The group of grave
silent men carrying away from the lighted candles and the white flowers 
the white still figure, which looked like an ivory statue when through 
our moving the robe fell back.

We laid her in the sarcophagus, and placed the severed hand in its true 
position on her breast.  Under it was laid the Jewel of Seven Stars, 
which Mr Trelawny had taken from the safe.  It seemed to flash and blaze 
as he put it in its place.  The glare of the electric lights shone cold 
on the great sarcophagus fixed ready for the final experiment--the Great 
Experiment, consequent on the researches during a lifetime of these two 
travelled scholars.  Again, the startling likeness between Margaret and 
the mummy, intensified by her own extraordinary pallor, heightened 
the strangeness of it all.

When all was finally fixed, three-quarters of an hour had gone; for we 
were deliberate in all our doings.  Margaret beckoned me, and I went 
with her to her room.  There she did a thing which moved me strangely, 
and brought home to me keenly the desperate nature of the enterprise 
on which we were embarked.  One by one, she blew out the candles 
carefully, and placed them back in their usual places.  When she had 
finished she said to me:

""They are done with!  Whatever comes--Life or Death--there will be no 
purpose in their using now!""

We returned to the cavern with a strange thrill as of finality.  There 
was to be no going back now!

We put on our respirators, and took our places as had been arranged.  I 
was to stand by the taps of the electric lights, ready to turn them off 
or on as Mr Trelawny should direct.  His last caution to me to carry out 
his instructions exactly was almost like a menace; for he warned me that 
death to any or all of us might come from any error or neglect on my part. 
Margaret and Doctor Winchester were to stand between the sarcophagus 
and the wall, so that they would not be between the mummy and the Magic 
Coffer.  They were to note accurately all that should happen with regard 
to the Queen.

Mr Trelawny and Mr Corbeck were to see the lamps lighted: and then to 
take their places, the former at the foot, the latter at the head, of 
the sarcophagus.

When the hands of the clock were close to the hour, they stood ready 
with their lit tapers, like gunners in old days with their linstocks.

For the few minutes that followed, the passing of time was a slow horror. 
Mr Trelawny stood with his watch in his hand, ready to give the signal.

The time approached with inconceivable slowness; but at last came the 
whirring of wheels which warns that the hour is at hand.  The striking of 
the silver bell of the clock seemed to smite on our hearts like the knell 
of doom. One! Two! Three!

The wicks of the lamps caught, and I turned out the electric light.  
In the dimness of the struggling lamps, and after the bright glow of 
the electric light, the room and all within it took weird shape, and 
everything seemed in an instant to change.  We waited, with our hearts 
beating.  I know mine did; and I fancied I could hear the pulsation 
of the others.  Without, the storm raged; the shutters of the narrow 
windows shook and strained and rattled, as though something was 
striving for entrance.

The seconds seemed to pass with leaden wings; it was as though all the 
world were standing still.  The figures of the others stood out dimly, 
Margaret's white dress alone showing clearly in the gloom.  The thick 
respirators, which we all wore, added to the strange appearance.  The 
thin light of the lamps, as the two men bent over the Coffer, showed Mr 
Trelawny's square jaw and strong mouth, and the brown, wrinkled face of 
Mr Corbeck.  Their eyes seemed to glare in the light.  Across the room 
Doctor Winchester's eyes twinkled like stars, and Margaret's blazed 
like black suns.

Would the lamps never burn up!

It was only a few seconds in all till they did blaze up.  A slow, steady
light, growing more and more bright; and changing in colour from blue 
to crystal white.  So they stayed for a couple of minutes, without any 
change in the Coffer being noticeable.  At last there began to appear 
all over it a delicate glow.  This grew and grew, till it became like a 
blazing jewel; and then like a living thing, whose essence was light.  
Mr Trelawny and Mr Corbeck moved silently to their places beside the 
sarcophagus.

We waited and waited, our hearts seeming to stand still.

All at once there was a sound like a tiny muffled explosion, and the
cover of the Coffer lifted right up on a level plane a few inches;
there was no mistaking anything now, for the whole cavern was full of 
light.  Then the cover, staying fast at one side, rose slowly up on the 
other, as though yielding to some pressure of balance.  I could not see 
what was within, for the risen cover stood between.  The Coffer still 
continued to glow; from it began to steal a faint greenish vapour which
floated in the direction of the sarcophagus as though impelled or drawn 
towards it.  I could not smell it fully on account of the respirator; 
but, even through that, I was conscious of a strange, pungent odour.  
The vapour got somewhat denser after a few seconds, and began to pass 
directly into the open sarcophagus.  It was evident now that the mummied 
body had some attraction for it; and also that it had some effect on 
the body, for the sarcophagus slowly became illumined as though the 
body had begun to glow.  I could not see within from where I stood, but 
I gathered from the faces of all the four watchers that something 
strange was happening.

I longed to run over and take a look for myself; but I remembered Mr 
Trelawny's solemn warning, and remained at my post.

The storm still thundered round the house, and I could feel the rock on 
which it was built tremble under the furious onslaught of the waves. 
The shutters strained as though the screaming wind without would in very 
anger have forced an entrance.  In that dread hour of expectancy, when 
the forces of Life and Death were struggling for the mastery, imagination 
was awake.  I almost fancied that the storm was a living thing, and 
animated with the wrath of the quick!

All at once the eager faces round the sarcophagus were bent forward. 
The look of speechless wonder in the eyes, lit by that supernatural glow 
from within the sarcophagus, had a more than mortal brilliance.

My own eyes were nearly blinded by the awful, paralysing light, so that 
I could hardly trust them.  I saw something white rising up from the open 
sarcophagus.  Something which appeared to my tortured eyes to be filmy, 
like a white mist.  In the heart of this mist, which was cloudy and opaque 
like an opal, was something like a hand holding a fiery jewel flaming 
with many lights.  As the fierce glow of the Coffer met this new living 
light, the green vapour floating between them seemed like a cascade of 
brilliant points--a miracle of light!

But at that very moment there came a change.  The fierce storm, battling 
with the shutters of the narrow openings, won victory.  With the sound 
of a pistol shot, one of the heavy shutters broke its fastening and was 
hurled on its hinges back against the wall.  In rushed a fierce blast 
which blew the flames of the lamps to and fro, and drifted the green 
vapour from its course.

On the very instant came a change in the outcome from the Coffer.  There 
was a moment's quick flame and a muffled explosion; and black smoke 
began to pour out.  This got thicker and thicker with frightful rapidity, 
in volumes of ever-increasing density; till the whole cavern began to 
get obscure, and its outlines were lost.  The screaming wind tore in and 
whirled it about.  At a sign from Mr Trelawny Mr Corbeck went and closed 
the shutter and jammed it fast with a wedge.

I should have liked to help; but I had to wait directions from Mr Trelawny, 
who inflexibly held his post at the head of the sarcophagus.  I signed to 
him with my hand, but he motioned me back.  Gradually the figures of all 
close to the sarcophagus became indistinct in the smoke which rolled round 
them in thick billowy clouds.  Finally, I lost sight of them altogether. 
I had a terrible desire to rush over so as to be near Margaret; but again 
I restrained myself.  If the Stygian gloom continued, light would be a 
necessity of safety; and I was the guardian of the light!  My anguish of 
anxiety as I stood to my post was almost unendurable.

The Coffer was now but a dull colour; and the lamps were growing dim, 
as though they were being overpowered by the thick smoke.  Absolute 
darkness would soon be upon us.

I waited and waited, expecting every instant to hear the command to turn 
up the light; but none came.  I waited still, and looked with harrowing 
intensity at the rolling billows of smoke still pouring out of the casket 
whose glow was fading.  The lamps sank down, and went out; one by one.

Finally, there was but one lamp alight, and that was dimly blue and 
flickering.  I kept my eyes fixed towards Margaret, in the hope that I
might see her in some lifting of the gloom; it was for her now that all
my anxiety was claimed.  I could just see her white frock beyond the 
dim outline of the sarcophagus.

Deeper and deeper grew the black mist, and its pungency began to assail 
my nostrils as well as my eyes.  Now the volume of smoke coming from the 
Coffer seemed to lessen, and the smoke itself to be less dense.  Across 
the room I saw a movement of something white where the sarcophagus was. 
There were several such movements.  I could just catch the quick glint 
of white through the dense smoke in the fading light; for now even the 
last lamp began to flicker with the quick leaps before extinction.

Then the last glow disappeared.  I felt that the time had come to speak; 
so I pulled off my respirator and called out:

""Shall I turn on the light?""  There was no answer.  Before the thick smoke 
choked me, I called again, but more loudly:

""Mr Trelawny, shall I turn on the light?  Answer me!  If you do not forbid 
me, I shall turn it on!""

As there was no reply, I turned the tap.  To my horror there was no response; 
something had gone wrong with the electric light!  I moved, intending to 
run up the staircase to seek the cause, but I could now see nothing, all was 
pitch dark.

I groped my way across the room to where I thought Margaret was.  As 
I went I stumbled across a body.  I could feel by her dress that it was 
a woman.  My heart sank; Margaret was unconscious, or perhaps dead.  I 
lifted the body in my arms, and went straight forward till I touched a wall. 
Following it round I came to the stairway, and hurried up the steps with 
what haste I could make, hampered as I was with my dear burden.  It may 
have been that hope lightened my task; but as I went the weight that I 
bore seemed to grow less as I ascended from the cavern.

I laid the body in the hall, and groped my way to Margaret's room, where 
I knew there were matches, and the candies which she had placed beside 
the Queen.  I struck a match; and oh! it was good to see the light. I lit 
two candies, and taking one in each hand, hurried back to the hall where 
I had left, as I had supposed, Margaret.

Her body was not there.  But on the spot where I had laid her was Queen 
Tera's Bridal robe, and surrounding it the girdle of wondrous gems.  Where 
the heart had been, lay the Jewel of Seven Stars. 

Sick at heart, and with a terror which has no name, I went down into the 
cavern.  My two candles were like mere points of light in the black, 
impenetrable smoke.  I put up again to my mouth the respirator which 
hung round my neck, and went to look for my companions.

I found them all where they had stood.  They had sunk down on the floor, 
and were gazing upward with fixed eyes of unspeakable terror.  Margaret 
had put her hands before her face, but the glassy stare of her eyes through 
her fingers was more terrible than an open glare.

I pulled back the shutters of all the windows to let in what air I could. 
The storm was dying away as quickly as it had risen, and now it only 
came in desultory puffs.  It might well be quiescent; its work was done!

I did what I could for my companions; but there was nothing that could 
avail.  There, in that lonely house, far away from aid of man, naught 
could avail.

It was merciful that I was spared the pain of hoping.

Jonathan Harker's Journal

3 May.  Bistritz.-- Left Munich at 8:35 P.M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna
early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late.
Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it
from the train and the little I could walk through the streets.
I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would
start as near the correct time as possible.

The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East;
the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble
width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.

We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.
Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale.  I had for dinner,
or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper,
which was very good but thirsty.  (Mem. get recipe for Mina.)
I asked the waiter, and he said it was called ""paprika hendl,""
and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it
anywhere along the Carpathians.

I found my smattering of German very useful here, indeed, I don't
know how I should be able to get on without it.

Having had some time at my disposal when in London,
I had visited the British Museum, and made search among
the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania;
it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could
hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman
of that country.


I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country,
just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia, and Bukovina,
in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known
portions of Europe.

I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality
of the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet
to compare with our own Ordance Survey Maps; but I found that Bistritz,
the post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place.
I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I
talk over my travels with Mina.

In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:
Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the descendants
of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the East and North.  I am
going among the latter, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns.
This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh
century they found the Huns settled in it.

I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into
the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort
of imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting.
(Mem., I must ask the Count all about them.)

I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had all
sorts of queer dreams.  There was a dog howling all night under my window,
which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been the paprika,
for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was still thirsty.
Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door,
so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.

I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour
which they said was ""mamaliga"", and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat,
a very excellent dish, which they call ""impletata"". (Mem., get recipe
for this also.)

I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight,
or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station
at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we
began to move.

It seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual
are the trains.  What ought they to be in China?

All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was
full of beauty of every kind.  Sometimes we saw little towns
or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals;
sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide
stony margin on each side of them to be subject ot great floods.
It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside
edge of a river clear.

At every station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds,
and in all sorts of attire.  Some of them were just like the peasants
at home or those I saw coming through France and Germany,
with short jackets, and round hats, and home-made trousers;
but others were very picturesque.

The women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they
were very clumsy about the waist.  They had all full white sleeves
of some kind or other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of
strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet,
but of course there were petticoats under them.

The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more
barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great baggy
dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy
leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass nails.
They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them,
and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches.
They are very picturesque, but do not look prepossessing.
On the stage they would be set down at once as some old
Oriental band of brigands.  They are, however, I am told,
very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-assertion.

It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz,
which is a very interesting old place.  Being practically on
the frontier--for the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--
it has had a very stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks
of it.  Fifty years ago a series of great fires took place,
which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions.
At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties
of war proper being assisted by famine and disease.

Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I found,
to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of course I wanted
to see all I could of the ways of the country.

I was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced
a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--
white undergarment with a long double apron, front, and back,
of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty.
When I came close she bowed and said, ""The Herr Englishman?""

""Yes,"" I said, ""Jonathan Harker.""

She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirtsleeves,
who had followed her to the door.

He went, but immediately returned with a letter:


""My friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians.  I am anxiously expecting you.
Sleep well tonight.  At three tomorrow the diligence will start for Bukovina;
a place on it is kept for you.  At the Borgo Pass my carriage will await
you and will bring you to me.  I trust that your journey from London has
been a happy one, and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.--
Your friend, Dracula.""


4 May--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,
directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me;
but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent,
and pretended that he could not understand my German.

This could not be true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly;
at least, he answered my questions exactly as if he did.

He and his wife, the old lady who had received me, looked at
each other in a frightened sort of way.  He mumbled out that
the money had been sent in a letter,and that was all he knew.
When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could tell me anything
of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves, and, saying
that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak further.
It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask anyone else,
for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting.

Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room
and said in a hysterical way:  ""Must you go?  Oh!  Young Herr,
must you go?""  She was in such an excited state that she seemed
to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and mixed it
all up with some other language which I did not know at all.
I was just able to follow her by asking many questions.
When I told her that I must go at once, and that I was engaged
on important business, she asked again:

""Do you know what day it is?""  I answered that it was the fourth of May.
She shook her head as she said again:

""Oh, yes!  I know that!  I know that, but do you know what day it is?""

On my saying that I did not understand, she went on:

""It is the eve of St. George's Day.  Do you not know that tonight,
when the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have
full sway?  Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?""
She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her,
but without effect.  Finally, she went down on her knees and implored
me not to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting.

It was all very ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable.
However, there was business to be done, and I could allow
nothing to interfere with it.

I tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked her,
but my duty was imperative, and that I must go.

She then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck
offered it to me.

I did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have
been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous,
and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning
so well and in such a state of mind.

She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put
the rosary round my neck and said, ""For your mother's sake,""
and went out of the room.

I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting for the coach,
which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still round my neck.

Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly
traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know,
but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual.

If this book should ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my goodbye.
Here comes the coach!


5 May.  The Castle.--The gray of the morning has passed,
and the sun is high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged,
whether with trees or hills I know not, for it is so far off
that big things and little are mixed.

I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,
naturally I write till sleep comes.

There are many odd things to put down, and, lest who reads
them may fancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz,
let me put down my dinner exactly.

I dined on what they called ""robber steak""--bits of bacon, onion, and beef,
seasoned with red pepper, and strung on sticks, and roasted over the fire,
in simple style of the London cat's meat!

The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue,
which is, however, not disagreeable.

I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.

When I got on the coach, the driver had not taken his seat,
and I saw him talking to the landlady.

They were evidently talking of me, for every now and then they looked at me,
and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door--
came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them pityingly.
I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were
many nationalities in the crowd, so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary
from my bag and looked them out.

I must say they were not cheering to me, for amongst them were
""Ordog""--Satan, ""Pokol""--hell, ""stregoica""--witch, ""vrolok"" and
""vlkoslak""--both mean the same thing, one being Slovak and the
other Servian for something that is either werewolf or vampire.
(Mem., I must ask the Count about these superstitions.)

When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this
time swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross
and pointed two fingers towards me.

With some difficulty, I got a fellow passenger to tell me what they meant.
He would not answer at first, but on learning that I was English,
he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye.

This was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown place to meet
an unknown man.  But everyone seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful,
and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched.

I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn yard
and its crowd of picturesque figures,all crossing themselves,
as they stood round the wide archway, with its background
of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs
clustered in the centre of the yard.

Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole
front of the boxseat,--""gotza"" they call them--cracked his
big whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast,
and we set off on our journey.

I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty
of the scene as we drove along, although had I known the language,
or rather languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking,
I might not have been able to throw them off so easily.
Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods,
with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees
or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road.
There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--
apple, plum, pear, cherry.  And as we drove by I could see
the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals.
In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here
the ""Mittel Land"" ran the road, losing itself as it swept
round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the straggling
ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down
the hillsides like tongues of flame.  The road was rugged,
but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste.
I could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver
was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund.
I was told that this road is in summertime excellent,
but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows.
In this respect it is different from the general run of roads
in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they
are not to be kept in too good order.  Of old the Hospadars
would not repair them, lest the Turk should think that they
were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten
the war which was always really at loading point.

Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes
of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves.
Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling
full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this
beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks,
green and brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless
perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags, till these were
themselves lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly.
Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which,
as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam
of falling water.  One of my companions touched my arm as we swept
round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered peak
of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way,
to be right before us.

""Look!  Isten szek!""--""God's seat!""--and he crossed himself reverently.

As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower
behind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us.
This was emphasized by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still
held the sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink.
Here and there we passed Cszeks and slovaks, all in picturesque attire,
but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent.  By the roadside were
many crosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves.
Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did
not even turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender
of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world.
There were many things new to me.  For instance, hay-ricks in the trees,
and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white
stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves.

Now and again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasants's cart--with its
long, snakelike vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the road.
On this were sure to be seated quite a group of homecoming peasants,
the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their coloured sheepskins,
the latter carrying lance-fashion their long staves, with axe at end.
As the evening fell it began to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed
to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine,
though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills,
as we ascended through the Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there
against the background of late-lying snow.  Sometimes, as the road was
cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing
down upon us, great masses of greyness which here and there bestrewed
the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried
on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening,
when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds
which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys.
Sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste,
the horses could only go slowly.  I wished to get down and walk
up them, as we do at home, but the driver would not hear of it.
""No, no,"" he said.  ""You must not walk here.  The dogs are too fierce.""
And then he added, with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry--
for he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest--""And
you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep.""
The only stop he would make was a moment's pause to light his lamps.

When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement
amongst the passengers, and they kept speaking to him,
one after the other, as though urging him to further speed.
He lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip, and with wild
cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions.
Then through the darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey
light ahead of us,as though there were a cleft in the hills.
The excitement of the passengers grew greater.
The crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed
like a boat tossed on a stormy sea.  I had to hold on.
The road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along.
Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side
and to frown down upon us.  We were entering on the Borgo Pass.
One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts,
which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take
no denial.  These were certainly of an odd and varied kind,
but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word,
and a blessing, and that same strange mixture of fear-meaning
movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz--
the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.
Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on
each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach,
peered eagerly into the darkness.  It was evident that something
very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked
each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation.
This state of excitement kept on for some little time.
And at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on
the eastern side.  There were dark, rolling clouds overhead,
and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder.
It seemed as though the mountain range had separated
two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one.
I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was
to take me to the Count.  Each moment I expected to see
the glare of lamps through the blackness, but all was dark.
The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which
the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud.
We could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there
was on it no sign of a vehicle.  The passengers drew back with a
sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment.
I was already thinking what I had best do, when the driver,
looking at his watch, said to the others something which I
could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low
a tone, I thought it was ""An hour less than the time.""
Then turning to me, he spoke in German worse than my own.

""There is no carriage here.  The Herr is not expected after all.
He will now come on to Bukovina, and return tomorrow or the next day,
better the next day.""  Whilst he was speaking the horses began
to neigh and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold
them up.  Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants
and a universal crossing of themselves, a caleche, with four horses,
drove up behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach.
I could see from the flash of our lamps as the rays fell on them,
that the horses were coal-black and splendid animals.  They were
driven by a tall man, with a long brown beard and a great black hat,
which seemed to hide his face from us.  I could only see the gleam
of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight,
as he turned to us.

He said to the driver, ""You are early tonight, my friend.""

The man stammered in reply, ""The English Herr was in a hurry.""

To which the stranger replied, ""That is why, I suppose, you wished
him to go on to Bukovina.  You cannot deceive me, my friend.
I know too much, and my horses are swift.""

As he spoke he smiled,and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth,
with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory.
One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burger's ""Lenore"".

""Denn die Todten reiten Schnell.""  (""For the dead travel fast."")


The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up
with a gleaming smile.  The passenger turned his face away,
at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself.
""Give me the Herr's luggage,"" said the driver, and with exceeding
alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the caleche.
Then I descended from the side of the coach, as the caleche
was close alongside, the driver helping me with a hand
which caught my arm in a grip of steel.  His strength must
have been prodigious.

Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we swept
into the darkness of the pass.  As I looked back I saw the steam
from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps,and projected
against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves.
Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off
they swept on their way to Bukovina.  As they sank into the darkness
I felt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling come over me.
But a cloak was thrown over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees,
and the driver said in excellent German--""The night is chill,
mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all care of you.
There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the country)
underneath the seat, if you should require it.""

I did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same.
I felt a little strangely, and not a little frightened.  I think had there
been any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that
unknown night journey.  The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,
then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road.
It seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again,
and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was so.
I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but I
really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any protest
would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay.

By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was passing,
I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch.
It was within a few minutes of midnight.  This gave me
a sort of shock, for I suppose the general superstition
about midnight was increased by my recent experiences.
I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.

Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far
down the road, a long, agonized wailing, as if from fear.
The sound was taken up by another dog, and then another
and another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly
through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come
from all over the country, as far as the imagination could
grasp it through the gloom of the night.

At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver
spoke to them soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered
and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright.
Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side
of us began a louder and a sharper howling, that of wolves,
which affected both the horses and myself in the same way.
For I was minded to jump from the caleche and run,
whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver
had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting.
In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound,
and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able
to descend and to stand before them.

He petted and soothed them, and whispered something in their ears,
as I have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect,
for under his caresses they became quite manageable again,
though they still trembled.  The driver again took his seat,
and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace.
This time, after going to the far side or the Pass, he suddenly
turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.

Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched
right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel.
And again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side.
Though we were in shelter, we could hear the rising wind,
for it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the
branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.
It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began
to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered
with a white blanket.  The keen wind still carried the howling
of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way.
The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer,
as though they were closing round on us from every side.
I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear.
The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed.
He kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see
anything through the darkness.

Suddenly, away on our left I saw a fain flickering
blue flame.  The driver saw it at the same moment.
He at once checked the horses, and, jumping to the ground,
disappeared into the darkness.  I did not know what to do,
the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer.
But while I wondered, the driver suddenly appeared again,
and without a word took his seat, and we resumed our journey.
I think I must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming
of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated endlessly,
and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.
Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in
the darkness around us I could watch the driver's motions.
He went rapidly to where the blue flame arose, it must have
been very faint, for it did not seem to illumine the place
around it at all, and gathering a few stones, formed them
into some device.

Once there appeared a strange optical effect.
When he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,
for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same.
This startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, I took
it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness.
Then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped onwards
through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us,
as though they were following in a moving circle.

At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than
he had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble
worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright.  I could not see
any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether.
But just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind
the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw
around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,
with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair.  They were a hundred times more
terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.
For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear.  It is only when a man
feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand
their true import.

All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight
had had some peculiar effect on them.  The horses jumped about
and reared, and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled
in a way painful to see.  But the living ring of terror encompassed
them on every side, and they had perforce to remain within it.
I called to the coachman to come, for it seemed to me that our
only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid
his approach, I shouted and beat the side of the caleche,
hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from the side, so as to give
him a chance of reaching the trap.  How he came there, I know not,
but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command,
and looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway.
As he swept his long arms, as though brushing aside some
impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still.
Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon,
so that we were again in darkness.

When I could see again the driver was climbing into the caleche,
and the wolves disappeared.  This was all so strange and uncanny
that a dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move.
The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost
complete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon.

We kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent,
but in the main always ascending.  Suddenly, I became conscious
of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses
in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black
windows came no ray of light,and whose broken battlements showed
a jagged line against the sky.





CHAPTER 2


Jonathan Harker's Journal Continued



5 May.--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully
awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place.
In the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size,
and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches,
it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is.  I have not yet been
able to see it by daylight.

When the caleche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand to
assist me to alight.  Again I could not but notice his prodigious strength.
His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed
mine if he had chosen.  Then he took my traps, and placed them on
the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and studded
with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone.
I could see even in th e dim light that the stone was massively carved,
but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather.
As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the reins.
The horses started forward,and trap and all disappeared down one of
the dark openings.

I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do.
Of bell or knocker there was no sign.  Through these frowning
walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my
voice could penetrate.  The time I waited seemed endless,
and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon me.  What sort
of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?
What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked?
Was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitor's
clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a London estate
to a foreigner?  Solicitor's clerk!  Mina would not like that.
Solicitor, for just before leaving London I got word that my
examination was successful, and I am now a full-blown solicitor!
I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if I were awake.
It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I expected
that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home,
with the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had
now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork.
But my flesh answered the pinching test, and my eyes were not
to be deceived.  I was indeed awake and among the Carpathians.
All I could do now was to be patient, and to wait the
coming of morning.

Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching behind
the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light.
Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts
drawn back.  A key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse,
and the great door swung back.

Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white moustache,
and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck of colour
about him anywhere.  He held in his hand an antique silver lamp, in which
the flame burned without a chimney or globe of any kind, throwing long
quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open door.
The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly gesture,
saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation.

""Welcome to my house!  Enter freely and of your own free will!""
He made no motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a
statue,as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone.
The instant, however, that I had stepped over the threshold,
he moved impulsively forward, and holding out his hand
grasped mine with a strength which made me wince, an effect
which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed cold
as ice, more like the hand of a dead than a living man.
Again he said.

""Welcome to my house!  Enter freely.  Go safely, and leave
something of the happiness you bring!""  The strength of
the handshake was so much akin to that which I had noticed
in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that for a moment I
doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was speaking.
So to make sure, I said interrogatively, ""Count Dracula?""

He bowed in a courtly was as he replied, ""I am Dracula, and I bid
you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house.  Come in, the night air
is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.""As he was speaking,
he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,
took my luggage.  He had carried it in before I could forestall him.
I protested, but he insisted.

""Nay, sir, you are my guest.  It is late, and my people are not available.
Let me see to your comfort myself.""He insisted on carrying my traps
along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and along
another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily.
At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced to see
within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,
and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,
flamed and flared.

The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing
the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room
lit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort.
Passing through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter.
It was a welcome sight.  For here was a great bedroom well lighted
and warmed with another log fire, also added to but lately, for the top
logs were fresh, which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney.
The Count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he
closed the door.

""You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself
by making your toilet.  I trust you will find all you wish.
When you are ready, come into the other room, where you will
find your supper prepared.""

The light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome seemed
to have dissipated all my doubts and fears.  Having then reached
my normal state, I discovered that I was half famished with hunger.
So making a hasty toilet, I went into the other room.

I found supper already laid out.  My host, who stood on one
side of the great fireplace, leaning against the stonework,
made a graceful wave of his hand to the table, and said,

""I pray you, be seated and sup how you please.  You will I trust,
excuse me that I do not join you, but I have dined already,
and I do not sup.""

I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.
He opened it and read it gravely.  Then, with a charming smile, he handed it
to me to read.  One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of pleasure.

""I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant
sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to come.
But I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in whom
I have every possible confidence.  He is a young man, full of energy
and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition.
He is discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service.
He shall be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay,
and shall take your instructions in all matters.""

The count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish,
and I fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken.
This, with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of old tokay,
of which I had two glasses, was my supper.  During the time I
was eating it the Count asked me many question as to my journey,
and I told him by degrees all I had experienced.

By this time I had finished my supper,and by my host's desire had drawn
up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,
at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke.
I had now an opportunity of observing him, and found him of a
very marked physiognomy.

His face was a strong, a very strong, aquiline, with high bridge of
the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils, with lofty domed forehead,
and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere.
His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose,
and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion.
The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache,
was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp
white teeth.  These protruded over the lips, whose remarkable
ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years.
For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed.
The chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm though thin.
The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.

Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his
knees in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine.
But seeing them now close to me, I could not but notice
that they were rather coarse, broad, with squat fingers.
Strange to say, there were hairs in the centre of the palm.
The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp point.
As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could
not repress a shudder.  It may have been that his breath was rank,
but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what
I would, I could not conceal.

The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back.  And with a grim sort
of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his protruberant teeth,
sat himself down again on his own side of the fireplace.
We were both silent for a while, and as I looked towards
the window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn.
There seemed a strange stillness over everything.  But as I listened,
I heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves.
The Count's eyes gleamed, and he said.

""Listen to them, the children of the night.  What music they make!""
Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he added,
""Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings
of the hunter.""  Then he rose and said.

""But you must be tired.  Your bedroom is all ready,
and tomorrow you shall sleep as late as you will.  I have
to be away till the afternoon, so sleep well and dream well!""
With a courteous bow, he opened for me himself the door
to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom.

I am all in a sea of wonders.  I doubt.  I fear.
I think strange things, which I dare not confess to my own soul.
God keep me, if only for the sake of those dear to me!


7 May.--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed
the last twenty-four hours.  I slept till late in the day,
and awoke of my own accord.  When I had dressed myself I
went into the room where we had supped, and found a cold
breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the pot being
placed on the hearth.  There was a card on the table,
on which was written--""I have to be absent for a while.
Do not wait for me.  D."" I set to and enjoyed a hearty meal.
When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I might let
the servants know I had finished, but I could not find one.
There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering
the extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me.
The table service is of gold, and so beautifully wrought
that it must be of immense value.  The curtains and upholstery
of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of my bed are
of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have
been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are
centuries old, though in excellent order.  I saw something
like them in Hampton Court, but they were worn and frayed and
moth-eaten. But still in none of the rooms is there a mirror.
There is not even a toilet glass on my table, and I had to get
the little shaving glass from my bag before I could either shave
or brush my hair.  I have not yet seen a servant anywhere,
or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.
Some time after I had finished my meal, I do not know whether
to call it breakfast of dinner, for it was between five and six
o'clock when I had it, I looked about for something to read,
for I did not like to go about the castle until I had asked
the Count's permission.  There was absolutely nothing in
the room, book, newspaper, or even writing materials, so I
opened another door in the room and found a sort of library.
The door opposite mine I tried, but found locked.

In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English books,
whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers.
A table in the center was littered with English magazines and newspapers,
though none of them were of very recent date.  The books were of the most
varied kind, history, geography, politics, political economy, botany, geology,
law, all relating to England and English life and customs and manners.
There were even such books of reference as the London Directory, the ""Red""
and ""Blue"" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the Army and Navy Lists, and it somehow
gladdened my heart to see it, the Law List.

Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count entered.
He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good night's rest.
Then he went on.

""I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there
is much that will interest you.  These companions,"" and he laid
his hand on some of the books, ""have been good friends to me,
and for some years past, ever since I had the idea of going to London,
have given me many, many hours of pleasure.  Through them I have
come to know your great England, and to know her is to love her.
I long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty London,
to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity, to share
its life, its change, its death, and all that makes it what it is.
But alas!  As yet I only know your tongue through books.
To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.""

""But, Count,"" I said, ""You know and speak English thoroughly!""
He bowed gravely.

""I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate,
but yet I fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel.
True, I know the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how
to speak them.

""Indeed,"" I said, ""You speak excellently.""

""Not so,"" he answered.  ""Well, I know that, did I move and
speak in your London, none there are who would not know me
for a stranger.  That is not enough for me.  Here I am noble.
I am a Boyar.  The common people know me, and I am master.
But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one.  Men know him not,
and to know not is to care not for.  I am content if I am
like the rest, so that no man stops if he sees me, or pauses
in his speaking if he hears my words, `Ha, ha!  A stranger!'
I have been so long master that I would be master still,
or at least that none other should be master of me.
You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter Hawkins,
of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London.
You shall, I trust, rest here with me a while, so that by our
talking I may learn the English intonation.  And I would that you
tell me when I make error, even of the smallest, in my speaking.
I am sorry that I had to be away so long today, but you will,
I know forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand.""

Of course I said all I could about being willing,
and asked if I might come into that room when I chose.
He answered, ""Yes, certainly,"" and added.

""You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors
are locked, where of course you will not wish to go.  There is reason
that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes
and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.""
I said I was sure of this, and then he went on.

""We are in Transylvania, and Transylvania is not England.
Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many
strange things.  Nay, from what you have told me of your
experiences already, you know something of what strange things
there may be.""

This led to much conversation, and as it was evident that he wanted
to talk, if only for talking's sake, I asked him many questions regarding
things that had already happened to me or come within my notice.
Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by pretending
not to understand, but generally he answered all I asked most frankly.
Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked him
of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as for instance,
why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames.
He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain
night of the year, last night, in fact, when all evil spirits are supposed
to have unchecked sway, a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure
has been concealed.

""That treasure has been hidden,"" he went on, ""in the region
through which you came last night, there can be but little doubt.
For it was the ground fought over for centuries by the Wallachian,
the Saxon, and the Turk.  Why, there is hardly a foot of soil
in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,
patriots or invaders.  In the old days there were stirring times,
when the Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots
went out to meet them, men and women, the aged and the children too,
and waited their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they
might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches.
When the invader was triumphant he found but little, for whatever
there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil.""

""But how,"" said I, ""can it have remained so long undiscovered,
when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?
""The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums,
the long, sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely.  He answered.

""Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool!
Those flames only appear on one night, and on that night no man
of this land will, if he can help it, stir without his doors.
And, dear sir, even if he did he would not know what to do.
Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who marked the place
of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even
for his own work.  Even you would not, I dare be sworn,
be able to find these places again?""

""There you are right,"" I said.  ""I know no more than the dead where even
to look for them.""  Then we drifted into other matters.

""Come,"" he said at last, ""tell me of London and of the house
which you have procured for me.""  With an apology for my remissness,
I went into my own room to get the papers from my bag.
Whilst I was placing them in order I heard a rattling of china
and silver in the next room, and as I passed through, noticed that
the table had been cleared and the lamp lit, for it was by this
time deep into the dark.  The lamps were also lit in the study
or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa, reading,
of all things in the world, and English Bradshaw's Guide.
When I came in he cleared the books and papers from the table,
and with him I went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts.
He was interested in everything, and asked me a myriad questions
about the place and its surroundings.  He clearly had studied
beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighborhood,
for he evidently at the end knew very much more than I did.
When I remarked this, he answered.

""Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should?  When I go there
I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan, nay, pardon me.
I fall into my country's habit of putting your patronymic first,
my friend Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me.
He will be in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law
with my other friend, Peter Hawkins.  So!""

We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase
of the estate at Purfleet.  When I had told him the facts
and got his signature to the necessary papers, and had
written a letter with them ready to post to Mr. Hawkins,
he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a place.
I read to him the notes which I had made at the time,
and which I inscribe here.

""At Purfleet, on a byroad, I came across just such a place as seemed
to be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place
was for sale.  It was surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,
built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of years.
The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with rust.

""The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old Quatre Face,
as the house is four sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass.
It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by the solid
stone wall above mentioned.  There are many trees on it, which make it
in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or small lake,
evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and flows away
in a fair-sized stream.  The house is very large and of all periods back,
I should say, to mediaeval times, for one part is of stone immensely thick,
with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron.
It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or church.
I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading to it from
the house, but I have taken with my Kodak views of it from various points.
The house had been added to, but in a very straggling way, and I can
only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must be very great.
There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very large house
only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum.
It is not, however, visible from the grounds.""

When I had finished, he said, ""I am glad that it is old and big.
I myself am of an old family, and to live in a new house
would kill me.  A house cannot be made habitable in a day,
and after all, how few days go to make up a century.
I rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times.
We Transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may
lie amongst the common dead.  I seek not gaiety nor mirth,
not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling
waters which please the young and gay.  I am no longer young,
and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead,
is attuned to mirth.  Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken.
The shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through
the broken battlements and casements.  I love the shade and
the shadow, and would be alone with my thoughts when I may.""
Somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord,
or else it was that his cast of face made his smile look
malignant and saturnine.

Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to pull my papers together.
He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of the books
around me.  One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally to England,
as if that map had been much used.  On looking at it I found in certain
places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed that one was
near London on the east side, manifestly where his new estate was situated.
The other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the Yorkshire coast.

It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned.
""Aha!"" he said.  ""Still at your books?  Good!  But you must not
work always.  Come!  I am informed that your supper is ready.""
He took my arm, and we went into the next room, where I found
an excellent supper ready on the table.  The Count again
excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from home.
But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.
After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count
stayed with me, chatting and asking questions on every
conceivable subject, hour after hour.  I felt that it was
getting very late indeed, but I did not say anything, for I
felt under obligation to meet my host's wishes in every way.
I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me,
but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes
over one at the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way,
the turn of the tide.  They say that people who are near death
die generally at the change to dawn or at the turn of the tide.
Anyone who has when tired, and tied as it were to his post,
experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it.
All at once we heard the crow of the cock coming up with
preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air.

Count Dracula, jumping to his feet, said, ""Why there is the morning again!
How remiss I am to let you stay up so long.  You must make your
conversation regarding my dear new country of England less interesting,
so that I may not forget how time flies by us,"" and with a courtly bow,
he quickly left me.

I went into my room and drew the curtains, but there was little to notice.
My window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the warm grey
of quickening sky.  So I pulled the curtains again, and have written
of this day.


8 May.--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I
was getting too diffuse.  But now I am glad that I went
into detail from the first, for there is something so strange
about this place and all in it that I cannot but feel uneasy.
I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had never come.
It may be that this strange night existence is telling on me,
but would that that were all!  If there were any one to talk
to I could bear it, but there is no one.  I have only the Count
to speak with, and he--I fear I am myself the only living soul
within the place.  Let me be prosaiac so far as facts can be.
It will help me to bear up, and imagination must not run riot
with me.  If it does I am lost.  Let me say at once how I stand,
or seem to.

I only slept a few hours when I went to bed,and feeling that I
could not sleep any more, got up.  I had hung my shaving glass
by the window, and was just beginning to shave.  Suddenly I felt
a hand on my shoulder, and heard the Count's voice saying to me,
""Good morning.""  I started, for it amazed me that I had not seen him,
since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me.
In starting I had cut myself slightly, but did not notice
it at the moment.  Having answered the Count's salutation,
I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.
This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me,
and I could see him over my shoulder.  But there was no reflection
of him in the mirror!  The whole room behind me was displayed,
but there was no sign of a man in it, except myself.

This was startling, and coming on the top of so many
strange things, was beginning to increase that vague feeling
of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near.
But at the instant I saw the the cut had bled a little,
and the blood was trickling over my chin.  I laid down the razor,
turning as I did so half round to look for some sticking plaster.
When the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a sort
of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat.
I drew away and his hand touched the string of beads
which held the crucifix.  It made an instant change in him,
for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe
that it was ever there.

""Take care,"" he said, ""take care how you cut yourself.
It is more dangerous that you think in this country.""
Then seizing the shaving glass, he went on, ""And this is
the wretched thing that has done the mischief.  It is a foul
bauble of man's vanity.  Away with it!""  And opening the window
with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung out the glass,
which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones
of the courtyard far below.  Then he withdrew without a word.
It is very annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave,
unless in my watch-case or the bottom of the shaving pot,
which is fortunately of metal.

When I went into the dining room, breakfast was prepared,
but I could not find the Count anywhere.  So I breakfasted alone.
It is strange that as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink.
He must be a very peculiar man!  After breakfast I did
a little exploring in the castle.  I went out on the stairs,
and found a room looking towards the South.

The view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every
opportunity of seeing it.  The castle is on the very edge
of a terrific precipice.  A stone falling from the window
would fall a thousand feet without touching anything!
As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops,
with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm.
Here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep
gorges through the forests.

But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen
the view I explored further.  Doors, doors, doors everywhere,
and all locked and bolted.  In no place save from the
windows in the castle walls is there an available exit.
The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!




CHAPTER 3


Jonathan Harker's Journal Continued


When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came
over me.  I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door
and peering out of every window I could find, but after a little
the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings.
When I look back after a few hours I think I must have been
mad for the time, for I behaved much as a rat does in a trap.
When, however, the conviction had come to me that I was helpless
I sat down quietly, as quietly as I have ever done anything
in my life, and began to think over what was best to be done.
I am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion.
Of one thing only am I certain.  That it is no use making my ideas
known to the Count.  He knows well that I am imprisoned, and as
he has done it himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it,
he would only deceive me if I trusted him fully with the facts.
So far as I can see, my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my
fears to myself, and my eyes open.  I am, I know, either being deceived,
like a baby, by my own fears, or else I am in desperate straits,
and if the latter be so, I need, and shall need, all my brains
to get through.

I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door
below shut, and knew that the Count had returned.  He did not come
at once into the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and
found him making the bed.  This was odd, but only confirmed what I
had all along thought, that there are no servants in the house.
When later I saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door
laying the table in the dining room, I was assured of it.
For if he does himself all these menial offices, surely it is proof
that there is no one else in the castle, it must have been the Count
himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here.
This is a terrible thought, for if so, what does it mean that he could
control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his hand for silence?
How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the coach had
some terrible fear for me?  What meant the giving of the crucifix,
of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash?

Bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck!
For it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it.
It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour
and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help.
Is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself,
or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy
and comfort?  Some time, if it may be, I must examine this matter
and try to make up my mind about it.  In the meantime I must find
out all I can about Count Dracula,as it may help me to understand.
Tonight he may talk of himself, if I turn the conversation that way.
I must be very careful, however, not to awake his suspicion.


Midnight.--I have had a long talk with the Count.
I asked him a few questions on Transylvania history,
and he warmed up to the subject wonderfully.  In his speaking
of things and people, and especially of battles, he spoke
as if he had been present at them all.  This he afterwards
explained by saying that to a Boyar the pride of his house
and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory,
that their fate is his fate.  Whenever he spoke of his
house he always said ""we"", and spoke almost in the plural,
like a king speaking.  I wish I could put down all he said
exactly as he said it, for to me it was most fascinating.
It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country.
He grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling
his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid
his hands as though he would crush it by main strength.
One thing he said which I shall put down as nearly as I can,
for it tells in its way the story of his race.

""We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood
of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship.
Here, in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down
from Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin game them,
which their Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards
of Europe, aye, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought
that the werewolves themselves had come.  Here, too, when they came,
they found the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a
living flame, till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran
the blood of those old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated
with the devils in the desert.  Fools, fools!  What devil or what
witch was ever so great as Attila, whose blood is in these veins?""
He held up his arms.  ""Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race,
that we were proud, that when the Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar,
or the Turk poured his thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back?
Is it strange that when Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian
fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier, that the Honfoglalas
was completed there?  And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward,
the Szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us
for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkeyland.
Aye, and more than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for as
the Turks say, `water sleeps, and the enemy is sleepless.'  Who more
gladly than we throughout the Four Nations received the `bloody sword,'
or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King?
When was redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova,
when the flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent?
Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube
and beat the Turk on his own ground?  This was a Dracula indeed!
Woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen,
sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them!
Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his race
who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river
into Turkeyland, who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again,
though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were
being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph!
They said that he thought only of himself.  Bah!  What good are peasants
without a leader?  Where ends the war without a brain and heart
to conduct it?  Again, when, after the battle of Mohacs, we threw off
the Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders,
for our spirit would not brook that we were not free.  Ah, young sir,
the Szekelys, and the Dracula as their heart's blood, their brains,
and their swords, can boast a record that mushroom growths like the
Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach.  The warlike days are over.
Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace,
and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.""

It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed.
(Mem., this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the
""Arabian Nights,"" for everything has to break off at cockcrow,
or like the ghost of Hamlet's father.)


12 May.--Let me begin with facts, bare, meager facts,
verified by books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt.
I must not confuse them with experiences which will have
to rest on my own observation, or my memory of them.
Last evening when the Count came from his room he began
by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing
of certain kinds of business.  I had spent the day wearily
over books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over
some of the matters I had been examined in at Lincoln's Inn.
There was a certain method in the Count's inquiries, so I shall
try to put them down in sequence.  The knowledge may somehow
or some time be useful to me.

First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more.
I told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not
be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction,
as only one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain
to militate against his interest.  He seemed thoroughly to understand,
and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one
man to attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case
local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor.
I asked to explain more fully, so that I might not by any chance mislead him,
so he said,

""I shall illustrate.  Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins,
from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter,
which is far from London, buys for me through your good self
my place at London.  Good!  Now here let me say frankly, lest you
should think it strange that I have sought the services of one so far
off from London instead of some one resident there, that my motive
was that no local interest might be served save my wish only,
and as one of London residence might, perhaps, have some purpose
of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to seek my agent,
whose labours should be only to my interest.  Now, suppose I,
who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle,
or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could
with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?""

I answered that certainly it would be most easy, but that we
solicitors had a system of agency one for the other, so that local
work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor,
so that the client, simply placing himself in the hands of one man,
could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble.

""But,"" said he, ""I could be at liberty to direct myself.
Is it not so?""

""Of course, "" I replied, and ""Such is often done by men of business,
who do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.""

""Good!"" he said,and then went on to ask about the means of making consignments
and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of difficulties
which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded against.
I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability, and he
certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful
solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or foresee.
For a man who was never in the country, and who did not evidently do
much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were wonderful.
When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had spoken,
and I had verified all as well as I could by the books available,
he suddenly stood up and said, ""Have you written since your first letter
to our friend Mr. Peter Hawkins, or to any other?""

It was with some bitterness in my heart that I answered that I had not,
that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody.

""Then write now, my young friend,"" he said, laying a heavy
hand on my shoulder, ""write to our friend and to any other,
and say, if it will please you, that you shall stay with me
until a month from now.""

""Do you wish me to stay so long?""  I asked, for my heart grew cold
at the thought.

""I desire it much, nay I will take no refusal.  When your master,
employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,
it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted.
I have not stinted.  Is it not so?""

What could I do but bow acceptance?  It was Mr. Hawkins'
interest, not mine, and I had to think of him, not myself,
and besides, while Count Dracula was speaking, there was that
in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember that I
was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I could have no choice.
The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his mastery in
the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them,
but in his own smooth, resistless way.

""I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not
discourse of things other than business in your letters.
It will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well,
and that you look forward to getting home to them.  Is it not so?""
As he spoke he handed me three sheets of note paper and
three envelopes.  They were all of the thinnest foreign post,
and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,
with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip,
I understood as well as if he had spoken that I should be
more careful what I wrote, for he would be able to read it.
So I determined to write only formal notes now, but to write fully
to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for to her I could
write shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he did see it.
When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a book
whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them
to some books on his table.  Then he took up my two and placed
them with his own, and put by his writing materials, after which,
the instant the door had closed behind him, I leaned over
and looked at the letters, which were face down on the table.
I felt no compunction in doing so for under the circumstances
I felt that I should protect myself in every way I could.

One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7,
The Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna.  The third
was to Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock
& Billreuth, bankers, Buda Pesth.  The second and fourth were unsealed.
I was just about to look at them when I saw the door handle move.
I sank back in my seat, having just had time to resume my book before
the Count, holding still another letter in his hand, entered the room.
He took up the letters on the table and stamped them carefully,
and then turning to me, said,

""I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private
this evening.  You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.""
At the door he turned, and after a moment's pause said, ""Let me advise you,
my dear young friend.  Nay, let me warn you with all seriousness,
that should you leave these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep
in any other part of the castle.  It is old, and has many memories,
and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely.  Be warned!
Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then haste
to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be safe.
But if you be not careful in this respect, then,"" He finished his speech
in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing them.
I quite understood.  My only doubt was as to whether any dream could
be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom and mystery
which seemed closing around me.


Later.--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no doubt
in question.  I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is not.
I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed, I imagine that my
rest is thus freer from dreams, and there it shall remain.

When he left me I went to my room.  After a little while,
not hearing any sound, I came out and went up the stone stair
to where I could look out towards the South.  There was some
sense of freedom in the vast expanse, inaccessible though it
was to me,as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard.
Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in prison, and I
seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of the night.
I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.
It is destroying my nerve.  I start at my own shadow, and am
full of all sorts of horrible imaginings.  God knows that there
is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place!
I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft
yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day.
In the soft light the distant hills became melted,
and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness.
The mere beauty seemed to cheer me.  There was peace and comfort
in every breath I drew.  As I leaned from the window my eye
was caught by something moving a storey below me, and somewhat
to my left, where I imagined, from the order of the rooms,
that the windows of the Count's own room would look out.
The window at which I stood was tall and deep,
stone-mullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete.
But it was evidently many a day since the case had been there.
I drew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully out.

What I saw was the Count's head coming out from the window.
I did not see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the
movement of his back and arms.  In any case I could not mistake
the hands which I had had some many opportunities of studying.
I was at first interested and somewhat amused, for it is wonderful
how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner.
But my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole
man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle
wall over the dreadful abyss, face down with his cloak spreading out
around him like great wings.  At first I could not believe my eyes.
I thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect
of shadow, but I kept looking, and it could be no delusion.
I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones,
worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using
every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed,
just as a lizard moves along a wall.

What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature, is it in the semblance
of man?  I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering me.
I am in fear, in awful fear, and there is no escape for me.
I am encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of.


15 May.--Once more I have seen the count go out in his lizard fashion.
He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down,
and a good deal to the left.  He vanished into some hole or window.
When his head had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more,
but without avail.  The distance was too great to allow a proper angle
of sight.  I knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use
the opportunity to explore more than I had dared to do as yet.
I went back to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors.
They were all locked, as I had expected, and the locks were
comparatively new.  But I went down the stone stairs to the hall
where I had entered originally.  I found I could pull back the bolts
easily enough and unhook the great chains.  But the door was locked,
and the key was gone!  That key must be in the Count's room.
I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and escape.
I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs
and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them.
One or two small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing
to see in them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten.
At last, however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which,
though it seemed locked, gave a little under pressure.
I tried it harder, and found that it was not really locked,
but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges
had fallen somewhat,and the heavy door rested on the floor.
Here was an opportunity which I might not have again, so I exerted
myself,and with many efforts forced it back so that I could enter.
I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms
I knew and a storey lower down.  From the windows I could see
that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle,
the windows of the end room looking out both west and south.
On the latter side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice.
The castle was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on
three sides it was quite impregnable, and great windows were
placed here where sling, or bow, or culverin could not reach,
and consequently light and comfort, impossible to a position which
had to be guarded, were secured.  To the west was a great valley,
and then, rising far away, great jagged mountain fastnesses,
rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn,
whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone.
This was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies
in bygone days, for the furniture had more an air of comfort than
any I had seen.

The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight,
flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to see
even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over
all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and moth.
My lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight,
but I was glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness
in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble.
Still, it was better than living alone in the rooms which I had
come to hate from the presence of the Count, and after trying
a little to school my nerves, I found a soft quietude come over me.
Here I am, sitting at a little oak table where in old times
possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and
many blushes, her ill-spelt love letter, and writing in my diary
in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last.
It is the nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance.
And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had,
and have, powers of their own which mere ""modernity"" cannot kill.


Later:  The morning of 16 May.--God preserve my sanity, for to this I
am reduced.  Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.
Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for,
that I may not go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already.
If I be sane, then surely it is maddening to think that of all
the foul things that lurk in this hateful place the Count is
the least dreadful to me, that to him alone I can look for safety,
even though this be only whilst I can serve his purpose.  Great God!
Merciful God, let me be calm, for out of that way lies madness indeed.
I begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me.
Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant when he made
Hamlet say, ""My tablets!  Quick, my tablets! `tis meet that I
put it down,"" etc., For now, feeling as though my own brain were
unhinged or as if the shock had come which must end in its undoing,
I turn to my diary for repose.  The habit of entering accurately
must help to soothe me.

The Count's mysterious warning frightened me at the time.  It frightens me
more not when I think of it, for in the future he has a fearful hold upon me.
I shall fear to doubt what he may say!

When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced
the book and pen in my pocket I felt sleepy.  The Count's warning
came into my mind, but I took pleasure in disobeying it.
The sense of sleep was upon me, and with it the obstinacy which sleep
brings as outrider.  The soft moonlight soothed, and the wide
expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me.
I determined not to return tonight to the gloom-haunted rooms,
but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat and sung
and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad
for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars.
I drew a great couch out of its place near the corner, so that
as I lay, I could look at the lovely view to east and south,and
unthinking of and uncaring for the dust, composed myself for sleep.
I suppose I must have fallen asleep.  I hope so, but I fear,
for all that followed was startlingly real, so real that now
sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the morning,
I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.

I was not alone.  The room was the same, unchanged in any
way since I came into it.  I could see along the floor,
in the brilliant moonlight, my own footsteps marked where I had
disturbed the long accumulation of dust.  In the moonlight opposite
me were three young women, ladies by their dress and manner.
I thought at the time that I must be dreaming when I saw them,
they threw no shadow on the floor.  They came close to me,
and looked at me for some time, and then whispered together.
Two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like the Count,
and great dark, piercing eyes, that seemed to be almost red
when contrasted with the pale yellow moon.  The other was
fair,as fair as can be, with great masses of golden hair
and eyes like pale sapphires.  I seemed somehow to know
her face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear,
but I could not recollect at the moment how or where.
All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls
against the ruby of their voluptuous lips.  There was
something about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at
the same time some deadly fear.  I felt in my heart a wicked,
burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips.
It is not good to note this down, lest some day it should
meet Mina's eyes and cause her pain, but it is the truth.
They whispered together, and then they all three laughed,
such a silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound
never could have come through the softness of human lips.
It was like the intolerable, tingling sweetness of waterglasses
when played on by a cunning hand.  The fair girl shook her
head coquettishly, and the other two urged her on.

One said, ""Go on!  You are first, and we shall follow.
Yours' is the right to begin.""

The other added, ""He is young and strong.  There are kisses for us all.""

I lay quiet, looking out from under my eyelashes in an agony
of delightful anticipation.  The fair girl advanced and bent
over me till I could feel the movement of her breath upon me.
Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent the same tingling
through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter underlying
the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.

I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under
the lashes.  The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply gloating.
There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive,
and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal,
till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet
lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth.
Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my
mouth and chin and seemed to fasten on my throat.  Then she paused,
and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked
her teeth and lips, and I could feel the hot breath on my neck.
Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand
that is to tickle it approaches nearer, nearer.  I could feel the soft,
shivering touch of the lips on the super sensitive skin of my throat,
and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.
I closed my eyes in languorous ecstasy and waited, waited with beating heart.

But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick
as lightning.  I was conscious of the presence of the Count,
and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury.  As my eyes
opened involuntarily I saw his strong hand grasp the slender
neck of the fair woman and with giant's power draw it back,
the blue eyes transformed with fury, the white teeth champing
with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion.
But the Count!  Never did I imagine such wrath and fury,
even to the demons of the pit.  His eyes were positively blazing.
The red light in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell fire
blazed behind them.  His face was deathly pale, and the lines
of it were hard like drawn wires.  The thick eyebrows that met
over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of whitehot metal.
With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman from him,
and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating them back.
It was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves.
In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed
to cut through the air and then ring in the room he said,

""How dare you touch him, any of you?  How dare you cast eyes
on him when I had forbidden it?  Back, I tell you all!
This man belongs to me!  Beware how you meddle with him,
or you'll have to deal with me.""

The fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him.
""You yourself never loved.  You never love!""  On this the other
women joined,and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter
rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear.
It seemed like the pleasure of fiends.

Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,
and said in a soft whisper, ""Yes, I too can love.
You yourselves can tell it from the past.  Is it not so?
Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall
kiss him at your will.  Now go!  Go!  I must awaken him,
for there is work to be done.""

""Are we to have nothing tonight?"" said one of them, with a low laugh,
as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor,
and which moved as though there were some living thing within it.
For answer he nodded his head.  One of the women jumped
forward and opened it.  If my ears did not deceive me there
was a gasp and a low wail, as of a half smothered child.
The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with horror.
But as I looked, they disappeared, and with them the dreadful bag.
There was no door near them, and they could not have passed
me without my noticing.  They simply seemed to fade into
the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window,
for I could see outside the dim, shadowy forms for a moment
before they entirely faded away.

Then the horror overcame me,and I sank down unconscious.





CHAPTER 4


Jonathan Harker's Journal Continued


I awoke in my own bed.  If it be that I had not dreamt,
the Count must have carried me here.  I tried to satisfy myself
on the subject, but could not arrive at any unquestionable result.
To be sure, there were certain small evidences, such as that my
clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not my habit.
My watch was still unwound, and I am rigorously accustomed to wind
it the last thing before going to bed, and many such details.
But these things are no proof, for they may have been evidences that my
mind was not as usual, and, for some cause or another, I had certainly
been much upset.  I must watch for proof.  Of one thing I am glad.
If it was that the Count carried me here and undressed me,
he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact.
I am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which
he would not have brooked.  He would have taken or destroyed it.
As I look round this room, although it has been to me so full of fear,
it is now a sort of sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful
than those awful women, who were, who are, waiting to suck my blood.


18 May.--I have been down to look at that room again in daylight,
for I must know the truth.  When I got to the doorway at the top
of the stairs I found it closed.  It had been so forcibly driven
against the jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered.
I could see that the bolt of the lock had not been shot,
but the door is fastened from the inside.  I fear it was no dream,
and must act on this surmise.


19 May.--I am surely in the toils.  Last night the Count
asked me in the sauvest tones to write three letters,
one saying that my work here was nearly done, and that I
should start for home within a few days,another that I was
starting on the next morning from the time of the letter,
and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at Bistritz.
I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state
of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count
whilst I am so absolutely in his power.  And to refuse
would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger.
He knows that I know too much, and that I must not live, lest I be
dangerous to him.  My only chance is to prolong my opportunities.
Something may occur which will give ma a chance to escape.
I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath which
was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him.
He explained to me that posts were few and uncertain,
and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends.
And he assured me with so much impressiveness that he would
countermand the later letters, which would be held over at Bistritz
until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging my stay,
that to oppose him would have been to create new suspicion.
I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked
him what dates I should put on the letters.

He calculated a minute, and then said, ""The first should be June 12,
the second June 19,and the third June 29.""

I know now the span of my life.  God help me!


28 May.--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able
to send word home.  A band of Szgany have come to the castle,
and are encamped in the courtyard.  These are gipsies.
I have notes of them in my book.  They are peculiar to this part of
the world, though allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over.
There are thousands of them in Hungary and Transylvania,
who are almost outside all law.  They attach themselves as a rule
to some great noble or boyar, and call themselves by his name.
They are fearless and without religion, save superstition,
and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany tongue.

I shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them
to have them posted.  I have already spoken to them through
my window to begin acquaintanceship.  They took their hats
off and made obeisance and many signs, which however, I could
not understand any more than I could their spoken language.
. .

I have written the letters.  Mina's is in shorthand, and I simply
ask Mr. Hawkins to communicate with her.  To her I have explained
my situation, but without the horrors which I may only surmise.
It would shock and frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her.
Should the letters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know
my secret or the extent of my knowledge.  . .


I have given the letters.  I threw them through the bars of my window with a
gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted.  The man who took
them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them in his cap.
I could do no more.  I stole back to the study, and began to read.
As the Count did not come in, I have written here.  . .


The Count has come.  He sat down beside me, and said in his
smoothest voice as he opened two letters, ""The Szgany has
given me these, of which, though I know not whence they come,
I shall, of course, take care.  See!""--He must have looked
at it.--""One is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins.
The other,""--here he caught sight of the strange symbols
as he opened the envelope, and the dark look came into
his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly,--""The other is
a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality!
It is not signed.  Well!  So it cannot matter to us.""And
he calmly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp
till they were consumed.

Then he went on, ""The letter to Hawkins, that I shall, of course
send on, since it is yours.  Your letters are sacred to me.
Your pardon, my friend, that unknowingly I did break the seal.
Will you not cover it again?""  He held out the letter to me,
and with a courteous bow handed me a clean envelope.

I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence.
When he went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly.
A minute later I went over and tried it, and the door was locked.

When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room,
his coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa.
He was very courteous and very cheery in his manner,
and seeing that I had been sleeping, he said, ""So, my friend,
you are tired?  Get to bed.  There is the surest rest.
I may not have the pleasure of talk tonight, since there are
many labours to me, but you will sleep, I pray.""

I passed to my room and went to bed, and, strange to say,
slept without dreaming.  Despair has its own calms.

31 May.--This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself
with some papers and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket,
so that I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again
a surprise, again a shock!

Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda,
relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact
all that might be useful to me were I once outside the castle.
I sat and pondered awhile, and then some thought occurred to me,
and I made search of my portmanteau and in the wardrobe where I
had placed my clothes.

The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and rug.
I could find no trace of them anywhere.  This looked like some new scheme
of villainy.  . .


17 June.--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed
cudgelling my brains, I heard without a crackling of whips
and pounding and scraping of horses' feet up the rocky path
beyond the courtyard.  With joy I hurried to the window,
and saw drive into the yard two great leiter-wagons, each drawn
by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of each pair a Slovak,
with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty sheepskin,
and high boots.  They had also their long staves in hand.
I ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through
the main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them.
Again a shock, my door was fastened on the outside.

Then I ran to the window and cried to them.  They looked up at me
stupidly and pointed, but just then the ""hetman"" of the Szgany
came out, and seeing them pointing to my window, said something,
at which they laughed.

Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonized entreaty,
would make them even look at me.  They resolutely turned away.
The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick rope.
These were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks handled them,
and by their resonance as they were roughly moved.

When they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner
of the yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany,
and spitting on it for luck, lazily went each to his horse's head.
Shortly afterwards, I heard the crackling of their whips die away
in the distance.


24 June.--Last night the Count left me early, and locked himself
into his own room.  As soon as I dared I ran up the winding stair,
and looked out of the window, which opened South.  I thought I
would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.
The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing
work of some kind.  I know it, for now and then, I hear a far-away
muffled sound as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is,
it must be the end of some ruthless villainy.

I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour,
when I saw something coming out of the Count's window.
I drew back and watched carefully, and saw the whole man emerge.
It was a new shock to me to find that he had on the suit of clothes
which I had worn whilst travelling here, and slung over his
shoulder the terrible bag which I had seen the women take away.
There could be no doubt as to his quest, and in my garb, too!
This, then, is his new scheme of evil, that he will allow
others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave
evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting
my own letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall
by the local people be attributed to me.

It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up here,
a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which is even
a criminal's right and consolation.

I thought I would watch for the Count's return, and for a long time
sat doggedly at the window.  Then I began to notice that there were
some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight.
They were like the tiniest grains of dust,and they whirled round
and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way.  I watched
them with a sense of soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me.
I leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position,
so that I could enjoy more fully the aerial gambolling.

Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs
somewhere far below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight.
Louder it seemed to ring in my ears, and the floating moats of dust
to take new shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight.
I felt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts.
Nay, my very soul was struggling, and my half-remembered sensibilities
were striving to answer the call.  I was becoming hypnotised!

Quicker and quicker danced the dust.  The moonbeams seemed
to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom beyond.
More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes.
And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my senses,
and ran screaming from the place.

The phantom shapes, which were becoming gradually materialised
from the moonbeams, were those three ghostly women to whom
I was doomed.

I fled, and felt somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight,
and where the lamp was burning brightly.

When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in
the Count's room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed.
And then there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me.
With a beating heart, I tried the door, but I was locked in my prison,
and could do nothing.  I sat down and simply cried.

As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without, the agonised
cry of a woman.  I rushed to the window, and throwing it up,
peered between the bars.

There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her
hands over her heart as one distressed with running.
She was leaning against the corner of the gateway.
When she saw my face at the window she threw herself forward,
and shouted in a voice laden with menace, ""Monster, give
me my child!""

She threw herself on her knees,and raising up her hands,
cried the same words in tones which wrung my heart.
Then she tore her hair and beat her breast, and abandoned
herself to all the violences of extravagant emotion.
Finally, she threw herself forward, and though I could not see her,
I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.

Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice
of the Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper.  His call
seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves.
Before many minutes had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up
dam when liberated, through the wide entrance into the courtyard.

There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but short.
Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.

I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child,
and she was better dead.

What shall I do?  What can I do?  How can I escape from this
dreadful thing of night, gloom, and fear?


25 June.--No man knows till he has suffered from the night
how sweet and dear to his heart and eye the morning can be.
When the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top
of the great gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it
touched seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had lighted there.
My fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment
which dissolved in the warmth.

I must take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me.
Last night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal
series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the earth.

Let me not think of it.  Action!

It has always been at night-time that I have been molested
or threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear.
I have not yet seen the Count in the daylight.  Can it be that
he sleeps when others wake, that he may be awake whilst they sleep?
If I could only get into his room!  But there is no possible way.
The door is always locked, no way for me.

Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it.  Where his body has
gone why may not another body go?  I have seen him myself crawl from
his window.  Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window?
The chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still.
I shall risk it.  At the worst it can only be death, and a man's death
is not a calf's, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me.
God help me in my task!  Goodbye, Mina, if I fail.  Goodbye, my faithful
friend and second father.  Goodbye, all, and last of all Mina!


Same day, later.--I have made the effort, and God helping me, have come
safely back to this room.  I must put down every detail in order.
I went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side,
and at once got outside on this side.  The stones are big and roughly cut,
and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them.
I took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way.
I looked down once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful
depth would not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it.
I know pretty well the direction and distance of the Count's window, and made
for it as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available.
I did not feel dizzy, I suppose I was too excited, and the time seemed
ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window sill and
trying to raise up the sash.  I was filled with agitation, however, when I
bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window.  Then I looked
around for the Count, but with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.
The room was empty!  It was barely furnished with odd things, which seemed
to have never been used.

The furniture was something the same style as that in the
south rooms, and was covered with dust.  I looked for the key,
but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it anywhere.
The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one corner,
gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian,and
Hungarian,and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film
of dust, as though it had lain long in the ground.
None of it that I noticed was less than three hundred years old.
There were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled, but all
of them old and stained.

At one corner of the room was a heavy door.  I tried it, for, since I
could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door,
which was the main object of my search, I must make further examination,
or all my efforts would be in vain.  It was open, and led through a stone
passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down.

I descended, minding carefully where I went for the stairs
were dark, being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry.
At the bottom there was a dark, tunnel-like passage, through which
came a deathly, sickly odour, the odour of old earth newly turned.
As I went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier.
At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar, and found myself
in an old ruined chapel, which had evidently been used as a graveyard.
The roof was broken, and in two places were steps leading to vaults,
but the ground had recently been dug over, and the earth placed
in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been brought
by the Slovaks.

There was nobody about, and I made a search over every inch
of the ground, so as not to lose a chance.  I went down even
into the vaults, where the dim light struggled,although to do
so was a dread to my very soul.  Into two of these I went,
but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust.
In the third, however, I made a discovery.

There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty
in all, on a pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count!
He was either dead or asleep.  I could not say which, for eyes
were open and stony, but without the glassiness of death,and
the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor.
The lips were as red as ever.  But there was no sign of movement,
no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart.

I bent over him, and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain.
He could not have lain there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away
in a few hours.  By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes
here and there.  I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went
to search I saw the dead eyes, and in them dead though they were, such a look
of hate, though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place,
and leaving the Count's room by the window, crawled again up the castle wall.
Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think.


29 June.--Today is the date of my last letter, and the Count has taken
steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the castle by
the same window, and in my clothes.  As he went down the wall, lizard fashion,
I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might destroy him.  But I
fear that no weapon wrought along by man's hand would have any effect on him.
I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared to see those weird sisters.
I came back to the library, and read there till I fell asleep.

I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man could look
as he said, ""Tomorrow, my friend, we must part.  You return to your beautiful
England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never meet.
Your letter home has been despatched.  Tomorrow I shall not be here,
but all shall be ready for your journey.  In the morning come the Szgany,
who have some labours of their own here, and also come some Slovaks.
When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall bear you
to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to Bistritz.
But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle Dracula.""

I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.  Sincerity!  It seems
like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster,
so I asked him point-blank, ""Why may I not go tonight?""

""Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.""

""But I would walk with pleasure.  I want to get away at once.""

He smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I
knew there was some trick behind his smoothness.  He said,
""And your baggage?""

""I do not care about it.  I can send for it some other time.""

The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made
me rub my eyes, it seemed so real, ""You English have a saying
which is close to my heart, for its spirit is that which rules
our boyars, `Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest.'
Come with me, my dear young friend.  Not an hour shall you wait
in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going,and
that you so suddenly desire it.  Come!""  With a stately gravity,
he, with the lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall.
Suddenly he stopped.  ""Hark!""

Close at hand came the howling of many wolves.  It was almost as if
the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music
of a great orchestra seems to leap under the baton of the conductor.
After a pause of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way,
to the door, drew back the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains,
and began to draw it open.

To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked.
Suspiciously, I looked all round, but could see no key
of any kind.

As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew
louder and angrier.  Their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their
blunt-clawed feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door.
I knew than that to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless.
With such allies as these at his command, I could do nothing.

But still the door continued slowly to open, and only
the Count's body stood in the gap.  Suddenly it struck
me that this might be the moment and means of my doom.
I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation.
There was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for
the Count, and as the last chance I cried out, ""Shut the door!
I shall wait till morning.""  And I covered my face with my hands
to hide my tears of bitter disappointment.

With one sweep of his powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut,
and the great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as they
shot back into their places.

In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went to my
own room.  The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand to me,
with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that Judas in hell
might be proud of.

When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard
a whispering at my door.  I went to it softly and listened.
Unless my ears deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count.

""Back!  Back to your own place!  Your time is not
yet come.  Wait!  Have patience!  Tonight is mine.
Tomorrow night is yours!""

There was a low, sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open
the door, and saw without the three terrible women licking their lips.
As I appeared, they all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.

I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees.
It is then so near the end?  Tomorrow!  Tomorrow!  Lord, help me,
and those to whom I am dear!


30 June.--These may be the last words I ever write in this diary.
I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself on my knees,
for I determined that if Death came he should find me ready.

At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning
had come.  Then came the welcome cockcrow, and I felt that I was safe.
With a glad heart, I opened the door and ran down the hall.
I had seen that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me.
With hands that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and threw
back the massive bolts.

But the door would not move.  Despair seized me.  I pulled
and pulled at the door, and shook it till, massive as it was,
it rattled in its casement.  I could see the bolt shot.
It had been locked after I left the Count.

Then a wild desire took me to obtain the key at any risk,and
I determined then and there to scale the wall again, and gain
the Count's room.  He might kill me, but death now seemed
the happier choice of evils.  Without a pause I rushed up
to the east window, and scrambled down the wall,as before,
into the Count's room.  It was empty, but that was as I expected.
I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold remained.
I went through the door in the corner and down the winding
stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel.
I knew now well enough where to find the monster I sought.

The great box was in the same place, close against the wall,
but the lid was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails
ready in their places to be hammered home.

I knew I must reach the body for the key, so I raised the lid,
and laid it back against the wall.  And then I saw something
which filled my very soul with horror.  There lay the Count,
but looking as if his youth had been half restored.
For the white hair and moustache were changed to dark
iron-grey. The cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed
ruby-red underneath.  The mouth was redder than ever,
for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from
the corners of the mouth and ran down over the chin and neck.
Even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh,
for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated.  It seemed
as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood.
He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion.

I shuddered as I bent over to touch him,and every sense in me
revolted at the contact, but I had to search, or I was lost.
The coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar war
to those horrid three.  I felt all over the body, but no sign
could I find of the key.  Then I stopped and looked at the Count.
There was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed
to drive me mad.  This was the being I was helping to transfer
to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come he might,
amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood,
and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons
to batten on the helpless.

The very thought drove me mad.  A terrible desire
came upon me to rid the world of such a monster.
There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a shovel
which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting
it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face.
But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell upon me,
with all their blaze of basilisk horror.  The sight seemed
to paralyze me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced
from the face, merely making a deep gash above the forehead.
The shovel fell from my hand across the box,and as I pulled
it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid
which fell over again, and hid the horrid thing from my sight.
The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face, blood-stained and
fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own
in the nethermost hell.

I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain
seemed on fire,and I waited with a despairing feeling growing
over me.  As I waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song
sung by merry voices coming closer, and through their song
the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips.
The Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had spoken were coming.
With a last look around and at the box which contained
the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count's room,
determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.
With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding
of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door.
There must have been some other means of entry, or some one
had a key for one of the locked doors.

Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying
away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo.
I turned to run down again towards the vault, where I might
find the new entrance, but at the moment there seemed to come
a violent puff of wind, and the door to the winding stair blew
to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying.
When I ran to push it open, I found that it was hopelessly fast.
I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing round
me more closely.

As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many
tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily,
doubtless the boxes, with their freight of earth.
There was a sound of hammering.  It is the box being nailed down.
Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall,
with with many other idle feet coming behind them.

The door is shut, the chains rattle.  There is a grinding of the key in
the lock.  I can hear the key withdrawn, then another door opens and shuts.
I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.

Hark!  In the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,
the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass
into the distance.

I am alone in the castle with those horrible women.  Faugh!  Mina is a woman,
and there is nought in common.  They are devils of the Pit!

I shall not remain alone with them.  I shall try to scale
the castle wall farther than I have yet attempted.
I shall take some of the gold with me, lest I want it later.
I may find a way from this dreadful place.

And then away for home!  Away to the quickest and nearest train!
Away from the cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil
and his children still walk with earthly feet!

At least God's mercy is better than that of those monsters,
and the precipice is steep and high.  At its foot a man may sleep,
as a man.  Goodbye, all.  Mina!





CHAPTER 5


LETTER FROM MISS MINA MURRAY TO MISS LUCY WESTENRA

9 May.

My dearest Lucy,


Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed
with work.  The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.
I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk
together freely and build our castles in the air.  I have been working
very hard lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan's studies,
and I have been practicing shorthand very assiduously.
When we are married I shall be able to be useful to Jonathan,
and if I can stenograph well enough I can take down what he wants
to say in this way and write it out for him on the typewriter,
at which also I am practicing very hard.

He and I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping
a stenographic journal of his travels abroad.  When I am with you
I shall keep a diary in the same way.  I don't mean one of those
two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries,
but a sort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined.

I do not suppose there will be much of interest to other people, but it
is not intended for them.  I may show it to Jonathan some day if there
is in it anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book.
I shall try to do what I see lady journalists do, interviewing and writing
descriptions and trying to remember conversations.  I am told that,
with a little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one
hears said during a day.

However, we shall see.  I will tell you of my little plans when we meet.
I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan from Transylvania.
He is well, and will be returning in about a week.  I am longing
to hear all his news.  It must be nice to see strange countries.
I wonder if we, I mean Jonathan and I, shall ever see them together.
There is the ten o'clock bell ringing.  Goodbye.

Your loving

Mina


Tell me all the news when you write.  You have not told me
anything for a long time.  I hear rumours, and especially
of a tall, handsome, curly-haired man.???



LETTER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA MURRAY



17, Chatham Street

Wednesday

My dearest Mina,


I must say you tax me very unfairly with being a bad correspondent.
I wrote you twice since we parted, and your last letter
was only your second.  Besides, I have nothing to tell you.
There is really nothing to interest you.

Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a great deal
to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park.
As to the tall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one
who was with me at the last Pop.  Someone has evidently
been telling tales.

That was Mr. Holmwood.  He often comes to see us, and he and Mamma get
on very well together, they have so many things to talk about in common.

We met some time ago a man that would just do for you, if you
were not already engaged to Jonathan.  He is an excellant parti,
being handsome, well off, and of good birth.  He is a doctor
and really clever.  Just fancy!  He is only nine-and twenty,
and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under his own care.
Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to see us,
and often comes now.  I think he is one of the most resolute men I
ever saw, and yet the most calm.  He seems absolutely imperturbable.
I can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients.
He has a curious habit of looking one straight in the face,
as if trying to read one's thoughts.  He tries this on very much
with me, but I flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack.
I know that from my glass.

Do you ever try to read your own face?  I do, and I can tell
you it is not a bad study, and gives you more trouble than you
can well fancy if you have never tried it.

He say that I afford him a curious psychological study,
and I humbly think I do.  I do not, as you know, take sufficient
interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions.
Dress is a bore.  That is slang again, but never mind.
Arthur says that every day.

There, it is all out, Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other
since we were children.  We have slept together and eaten together,
and laughed and cried together, and now, though I have spoken,
I would like to speak more.  Oh, Mina, couldn't you guess?  I love him.
I am blushing as I write, for although I think he loves me,
he has not told me so in words.  But, oh, Mina, I love him.
I love him!  There, that does me good.

I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire undressing,
as we used to sit, and I would try to tell you what I feel.
I do not know how I am writing this even to you.
I am afraid to stop, or I should tear up the letter,
and I don't want to stop, for I do so want to tell you all.
Let me hear from you at once, and tell me all that you think
about it.  Mina, pray for my happiness.

Lucy


P.S.--I need not tell you this is a secret.  Goodnight again.  L.




LETTER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA MURRAY

24 May

My dearest Mina,


Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter.
It was so nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.

My dear, it never rains but it pours.  How true the old proverbs are.
Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had
a proposal till today, not a real proposal, and today I had three.
Just fancy!  Three proposals in one day!  Isn't it awful!
I feel sorry, really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows.
Oh, Mina, I am so happy that I don't know what to do with myself.
And three proposals!  But, for goodness' sake, don't tell any of
the girls, or they would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas,
and imagining themselves injured and slighted if in their very first
day at home they did not get six at least.  Some girls are so vain!
You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and are going to settle
down soon soberly into old married women, can despise vanity.
Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep it
a secret, dear, from every one except, of course, Jonathan.
You will tell him, because I would, if I were in your place,
certainly tell Arthur.  A woman ought to tell her husband everything.
Don't you think so, dear?  And I must be fair.  Men like women,
certainly their wives, to be quite as fair as they are.  And women,
I am afraid, are not always quite as fair as they should be.

Well, my dear, number One came just before lunch.
I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic
asylum man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead.
He was very cool outwardly, but was nervous all the same.
He had evidently been schooling himself as to all sorts of
little things, and remembered them, but he almost managed to sit
down on his silk hat, which men don't generally do when they
are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept
playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream.
He spoke to me, Mina, very straightfordwardly.  He told me
how dear I was to him, though he had known me so little,
and what his life would be with me to help and cheer him.
He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I
did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said
he was a brute and would not add to my present trouble.
Then he broke off and asked if I could love him in time,
and when I shook my head his hands trembled, and then with some
hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one else.
He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring
my confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman's
heart was free a man might have hope.  And then, Mina, I felt
a sort of duty to tell him that there was some one.
I only told him that much, and then he stood up, and he looked
very strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his
and said he hoped I would be happy, and that If I ever wanted
a friend I must count him one of my best.

Oh, Mina dear, I can't help crying, and you must excuse this letter being
all blotted.  Being proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing,
but it isn't at all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow,
whom you know loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken hearted,
and to know that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing
out of his life.  My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so miserable,
though I am so happy.

Evening.


Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left off,
so I can go on telling you about the day.

Well, my dear, number Two came after lunch.  He is such a nice fellow,and
American from Texas, and he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost
impossible that he has been to so many places and has such adventures.
I sympathize with poor Desdemona when she had such a stream poured
in her ear, even by a black man.  I suppose that we women are such
cowards that we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him.
I know now what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl
love me.  No, I don't, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories,
and Arthur never told any, and yet.  . .

My dear, I am somewhat previous.  Mr. Quincy P. Morris found
me alone.  It seems that a man always does find a girl alone.
No, he doesn't, for Arthur tried twice to make a chance,
and I helping him all I could, I am not ashamed to say it now.
I must tell you beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn't always
speak slang, that is to say, he never does so to strangers
or before them, for he is really well educated and has
exquisite manners, but he found out that it amused me
to hear him talk American slang,and whenever I was present,
and there was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things.
I am afraid, my dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly
into whatever else he has to say.  But this is a way slang has.
I do not know myself if I shall ever speak slang.
I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never heard him
use any as yet.

Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked as happy and jolly
as he could, but I could see all the same that he was very nervous.
He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly.  . .

""Miss Lucy, I know I ain't good enough to regulate the fixin's of your
little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you
will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit.
Won't you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long
road together, driving in double harness?""

Well, he did look so hood humoured and so jolly that it didn't
seem half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward.
So I said, as lightly as I could, that I did not know anything
of hitching, and that I wasn't broken to harness at all yet.
Then he said that he had spoken in a light manner, and he hoped
that if he had made a mistake in doing so on so grave,
so momentous, and occasion for him, I would forgive him.
He really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn't help
feeling a sort of exultation that he was number Two in one day.
And then, my dear, before I could say a word he began pouring
out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very heart
and soul at my feet.  He looked so earnest over it that I
shall never again think that a man must be playful always,
and never earnest, because he is merry at times.
I suppose he saw something in my face which checked him,
for he suddenly stopped,and said with a sort of manly fervour
that I could have loved him for if I had been free.  . .

""Lucy, you are an honest hearted girl, I know.  I should not be here
speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit,
right through to the very depths of your soul.  Tell me, like one
good fellow to another, is there any one else that you care for?
And if there is I'll never trouble you a hair's breadth again,
but will be, if you will let me, a very faithful friend.""

My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy
of them?  Here was I almost making fun of this great hearted, true gentleman.
I burst into tears, I am afraid, my dear, you will think this a very sloppy
letter in more ways than one, and I really felt very badly.

Why can't they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want her,
and save all this trouble?  But this is heresy, and I must not say it.
I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into
Mr. Morris' brave eyes, and I told him out straight.  . .

""Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me
yet that he even loves me.""  I was right to speak to him
so frankly, for quite a light came into his face, and he put
out both his hands and took mine, I think I put them into his,
and said in a hearty way.  . .

""That's my brave girl.  It's better worth being late for
a chance of winning you than being in time for any other
girl in the world.  Don't cry, my dear.  If it's for me,
I'm a hard nut to crack, and I take it standing up.
If that other fellow doesn't know his happiness, well,
he'd better look for it soon, or he'll have to deal with me.
Little girl, your honesty and pluck have made me a friend,
and that's rarer than a lover, it's more selfish anyhow.
My dear, I'm going to have a pretty lonely walk between
this and Kingdom Come.  Won't you give me one kiss?
It'll be something to keep off the darkness now and then.
You can, you know, if you like, for that other good fellow,
or you could not love him, hasn't spoken yet.""

That quite won me, Mina, for it was brave and sweet of him, and noble too,
to a rival, wasn't it?  And he so sad, so I leant over and kissed him.

He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked
down into my face, I am afraid I was blushing very much,
he said, ""Little girl, I hold your hand, and you've kissed me,
and if these things don't make us friends nothing ever will.
Thank you for your sweet honesty to me, and goodbye.""

He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat, went straight out of the room
without looking back, without a tear or a quiver or a pause, and I am
crying like a baby.

Oh, why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots
of girls about who would worship the very ground he trod on?
I know I would if I were free, only I don't want to be free
My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I cannot write
of happiness just at once, after telling you of it,and I don't
wish to tell of the number Three until it can be all happy.
Ever your loving.  . .

Lucy


P.S.--Oh, about number Three, I needn't tell you of number Three, need I?
Besides, it was all so confused.  It seemed only a moment from his coming
into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was kissing me.
I am very, very happy, and I don't know what I have done to deserve it.
I must only try in the future to show that I am not ungrateful to God
for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a lover, such a husband,
and such a friend.

Goodbye.

DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY (Kept in phonograph)


25 May.--Ebb tide in appetite today.  Cannot eat, cannot rest, so
diary instead.  since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty feeling.
Nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth the doing.
As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was work, I went amongst
the patients.  I picked out one who has afforded me a study of much interest.
He is so quaint that I am determined to understand him as well as I can.
Today I seemed to get nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.

I questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view
to making myself master of the facts of his hallucination.
In my manner of doing it there was, I now see, something of cruelty.
I seemed to wish to keep him to the point of his madness, a thing
which I avoid with the patients as I would the mouth of hell.

(Mem., Under what circumstances would I not avoid the pit
of hell?) Omnia Romae venalia sunt.  Hell has its price!
If there be anything behind this instinct it will be valuable
to trace it afterwards accurately, so I had better commence
to do so, therefore.  . .

R. M, Renfield, age 59.  Sanguine temperament, great physical strength,
morbidly excitable, periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I
cannot make out.  I presume that the sanguine temperament itself
and the disturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished finish,
a possibly dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish.  In selfish
men caution is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves.
What I think of on this point is, when self is the fixed point
the centripetal force is balanced with the centrifugal.  When duty,
a cause, etc., is the fixed point, the latter force is paramount,
and only accident of a series of accidents can balance it.


LETTER, QUINCEY P. MORRIS TO HON.  ARTHUR HOLMOOD


25 May.

My dear Art,

We've told yarns by the campfire in the prairies, and dressed
one another's wounds after trying a landing at the Marquesas,
and drunk healths on the shore of Titicaca.  There are more yarns
to be told,and other wounds to be healed, and another health
to be drunk.  Won't you let this be at my campfire tomorrow night?
I have no hesitation in asking you, as I know a certain lady
is engaged to a certain dinner party, and that you are free.
There will only be one other, our old pal at the Korea, Jack Seward.
He's coming, too, and we both want to mingle our weeps over the wine cup,
and to drink a health with all our hearts to the happiest man
in all the wide world, who has won the noblest heart that God has
made and best worth winning.  We promise you a hearty welcome,
and a loving greeting, and a health as true as your own right hand.
We shall both swear to leave you at home if you drink too deep
to a certain pair of eyes.  Come!

Yours, as ever and always,

Quincey P. Morris





TELEGRAM FROM ARTHUR HOLMWOOD TO QUINCEY P. MORRIS

Count me in every time.  I bear messages which will make
both your ears tingle.

CHAPTER 6


MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL


24 July.  Whitby.--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter
and lovlier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent
in which they have rooms.  This is a lovely place.  The little river,
the Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes
near the harbour.  A great viaduct runs across, with high piers,
through which the view seems somehow further away than it really is.
The valley is beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you
are on the high land on either side you look right across it,
unless you are near enough to see down.  The houses of the old town--
the side away from us, are all red-roofed, and seem piled up one
over the other anyhow, like the pictures we see of Nuremberg.
Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby Abbey, which was sacked
by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of ""Marmion,""
where the girl was built up in the wall.  It is a most noble ruin,
of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits.
There is a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows.
Between it and the town there is another church, the parish one,
round which is a big graveyard, all full of tombstones.
This is to my mind the nicest spot in Whitby, for it lies right over
the town, and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay
to where the headland called Kettleness stretches out into the sea.
It descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has
fallen away, and some of the graves have been destroyed.

In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over
the sandy pathway far below.  There are walks, with seats beside them,
through the churchyard, and people go and sit there all day long looking
at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze.

I shall come and sit here often myself and work.
Indeed, I am writing now, with my book on my knee, and listening
to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me.
They seem to do nothing all day but sit here and talk.

The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long
granite wall stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards
at the end of it, in the middle of which is a lighthouse.
A heavy seawall runs along outside of it.  On the near side, the seawall
makes an elbow crooked inversely, and its end too has a lighthouse.
Between the two piers there is a narrow opening into the harbour,
which then suddenly widens.

It is nice at high water, but when the tide is out it shoals
away to nothing,and there is merely the stream of the Esk,
running between banks of sand, with rocks here and there.
Outside the harbour on this side there rises for about half a mile
a great reef, the sharp of which runs straight out from behind
the south lighthouse.  At the end of it is a buoy with a bell,
which swings in bad weather, and sends in a mournful sound
on the wind.

They have a legend here that when a ship is lost bells are heard out at sea.
I must ask the old man about this.  He is coming this way.  . .

He is a funny old man.  He must be awfully old, for his
face is gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree.
He tells me that he is nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor
in the Greenland fishing fleet when Waterloo was fought.
He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical person, for when I asked
him about the bells at sea and the White Lady at the abbey
he said very brusquely,

""I wouldn't fash masel' about them, miss.  Them things be all
wore out.  Mind, I don't say that they never was, but I do say
that they wasn't in my time.  They be all very well for comers
and trippers, an' the like, but not for a nice young lady like you.
Them feet-folks from York and Leeds that be always eatin'cured herrin's
and drinkin' tea an' lookin' out to buy cheap jet would creed aught.
I wonder masel' who'd be bothered tellin' lies to them,
even the newspapers, which is full of fool-talk.""

I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting
things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling
me something about the whale fishing in the old days.
He was just settling himself to begin when the clock struck six,
whereupon he laboured to get up, and said,

""I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss.  My grand-daughter doesn't
like to be kept waitin' when the tea is ready, for it takes me time
to crammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of `em, and miss,
I lack belly-timber sairly by the clock.""

He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could,
down the steps.  The steps are a great feature on the place.
They lead from the town to the church, there are hundreds of them,
I do not know how many, and they wind up in a delicate curve.
The slope is so gentle that a horse could easily walk up and down them.

I think they must originally have had something to do with the abbey.
I shall go home too.  Lucy went out, visiting with her mother,
and as they were only duty calls, I did not go.


1 August.--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most interesting
talk with my old friend and the two others who always come and join him.
He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them,and I should think must have been
in his time a most dictatorial person.

He will not admit anything, and down faces everybody.
If he can't out-argue them he bullies them,and then takes
their silence for agreement with his views.

Lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock.
She has got a beautiful colour since she has been here.

I noticed that the old men did not lose any time in coming
and sitting near her when we sat down.  She is so sweet with
old people, I think they all fell in love with her on the spot.
Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her,
but gave me double share instead.  I got him on the subject
of the legends , and he went off at once into a sort of sermon.
I must try to remember it and put it down.

""It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel, that's what it
be and nowt else.  These bans an' wafts an' boh-ghosts an'
bar-guests an' bogles an' all anent them is only fit to set bairns an'
dizzy women a'belderin'. They be nowt but air-blebs. They, an'
all grims an' signs an' warnin's, be all invented by parsons an'
illsome berk-bodies an' railway touters to skeer an' scunner hafflin's, an'
to get folks to do somethin' that they don't other incline to.
It makes me ireful to think o' them.  Why, it's them that, not content
with printin' lies on paper an' preachin' them ou t of pulpits,
does want to be cuttin' them on the tombstones.  Look here all around
you in what airt ye will.  All them steans, holdin' up their heads
as well as they can out of their pride, is acant, simply tumblin'
down with the weight o' the lies wrote on them, `Here lies the body'
or `Sacred to the memory' wrote on all of them, an' yet in nigh
half of them there bean't no bodies at all, an' the memories
of them bean't cared a pinch of snuff about, much less sacred.
Lies all of them, nothin' but lies of one kind or another!
My gog, but it'll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment
when they come tumblin' up in their death-sarks, all jouped
together an' trying' to drag their tombsteans with them to prove
how good they was, some of them trimmlin' an' dithering, with their
hands that dozzened an' slippery from lyin' in the sea that they
can't even keep their gurp o' them.""

I could see from the old fellow's self-satisfied air and the way in which
he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was ""showing off,""
so I put in a word to keep him going.

""Oh, Mr. Swales, you can't be serious.  Surely these tombstones
are not all wrong?""

""Yabblins!  There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin' where they
make out the people too good, for there be folk that do think
a balm-bowl be like the sea, if only it be their own.
The whole thing be only lies.  Now look you here.
You come here a stranger, an' you see this kirkgarth.""

I nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite understand
his dialect.  I knew it had something to do with the church.

He went on, ""And you consate that all these steans be aboon
folk that be haped here, snod an' snog?""  I assented again.
""Then that be just where the lie comes in.  Why, there be
scores of these laybeds that be toom as old Dun's `baccabox
on Friday night.""

He nudged one of his companions, and they all laughed.
""And, my gog!  How could they be otherwise?  Look at that one,
the aftest abaft the bier-bank, read it!""

I went over and read, ""Edward Spencelagh, master mariner,
murdered by pirates off the coast of Andres, April, 1854, age 30.""
When I came back Mr. Swales went on,

""Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here?  Murdered off
the coast of Andres!  An' you consated his body lay under!
Why, I could name ye a dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above,""
he pointed northwards, ""or where the currants may have drifted them.
There be the steans around ye.  Ye can, with your young eyes,
read the small print of the lies from here.  This Braithwaite Lowery,
I knew his father, lost in the Lively off Greenland in `20, or
Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the same seas in 1777, or John Paxton,
drowned off Cape Farewell a year later, or old John Rawlings,
whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned in the Gulf of Finland
in `50. Do ye think that all these men will have to make a rush
to Whitby when the trumpet sounds?  I have me antherums aboot it!
I tell ye that when they got here they'd be jommlin' and jostlin'
one another that way that it `ud be like a fight up on the ice
in the old days, when we'd be at one another from daylight
to dark, an' tryin' to tie up our cuts by the aurora borealis.""
This was evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it,
and his cronies joined in with gusto.

""But,"" I said, ""surely you are not quite correct, for you start
on the assumption that all the poor people, or their spirits,
will have to take their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment.
Do you think that will be really necessary?""

""Well, what else be they tombstones for?  Answer me that, miss!""

""To please their relatives, I suppose.""

""To please their relatives, you suppose!""  This he said with intense scorn.
""How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote over them,
and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?""

He pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab,
on which the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff.
""Read the lies on that thruff-stone,"" he said.

The letters were upside down to me from where I sat, but Lucy was more
opposite to them, so she leant over and read, ""Sacred to the memory
of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a glorious resurrection,
on July 29,1873, falling from the rocks at Kettleness.
This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly beloved
son.`He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.'
Really, Mr. Swales, I don't see anything very funny in that!""
She spoke her comment very gravely and somewhat severely.

""Ye don't see aught funny!  Ha-ha! But that's because ye
don't gawm the sorrowin'mother was a hell-cat that hated him
because he was acrewk'd, a regular lamiter he was, an' he hated
her so that he committed suicide in order that she mightn't
get an insurance she put on his life.  He blew nigh the top
of his head off with an old musket that they had for scarin'
crows with.  `twarn't for crows then, for it brought the clegs
and the dowps to him.  That's the way he fell off the rocks.
And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I've often heard
him say masel' that he hoped he'd go to hell, for his mother
was so pious that she'd be sure to go to heaven, an' he didn't
want to addle where she was.  Now isn't that stean at any rate,""
he hammered it with his stick as he spoke, ""a pack of lies?
And won't it make Gabriel keckle when Geordie comes pantin'
ut the grees with the tompstean balanced on his hump,
and asks to be took as evidence!""

I did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation
as she said, rising up, ""Oh, why did you tell us of this?
It is my favorite seat, and I cannot leave it, and now I find
I must go on sitting over the grave of a suicide.""

""That won't harm ye, my pretty, an' it may make poor Geordie
gladsome to have so trim a lass sittin' on his lap.
That won't hurt ye.  Why, I've sat here off an' on for
nigh twenty years past, an' it hasn't done me no harm.
Don't ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn'
lie there either!  It'll be time for ye to be getting scart
when ye see the tombsteans all run away with, and the place
as bare as a stubble-field. There's the clock, and'I must gang.
My service to ye, ladies!""  And off he hobbled.

Lucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful
before us that we took hands as we sat, and she told me
all over again about Arthur and their coming marriage.
That made me just a little heart-sick, for I haven't heard
from Jonathan for a whole month.


The same day.  I came up here alone, for I am very sad.  There was no
letter for me.  I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan.
The clock has just struck nine.  I see the lights scattered all over
the town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly.
They run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley.
To my left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house
next to the abbey.  The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away
behind me, and there is a clatter of donkeys' hoofs up the paved road below.
The band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and further
along the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street.
Neither of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see
them both.  I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me!
I wish he were here.


DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY

5 June.--The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more
I get to understand the man.  He has certain qualities very
largely developed, selfishness, secrecy, and purpose.

I wish I could get at what is the object of the latter.  He seems
to have some settled scheme of his own, but what it is I do not know.
His redeeming quality is a love of animals, though, indeed, he has such
curious turns in it that I sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel.
His pets are of odd sorts.

Just now his hobby is catching flies.  He has at present
such a quantity that I have had myself to expostulate.
To my astonishment, he did not break out into a fury,
as I expected, but took the matter in simple seriousness.
He thought for a moment, and then said, ""May I have three days?
I shall clear them away.""  Of course, I said that would do.
I must watch him.


18 June.--He has turned his mind now to spiders,and has got several
very big fellows in a box.  He keeps feeding them his flies,
and the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished,
although he has used half his food in attracting more flies
from outside to his room.


1 July.--His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his flies,
and today I told him that he must get rid of them.

He looked very sad at this, so I said that he must some of them,
at all events.  He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him
the same time as before for reduction.

He disgusted me much while with him, for when a horrid blowfly,
bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room, he caught it,
held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger and thumb,
and before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his mouth
and ate it.

I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it was very good and
very wholesome, that it was life, strong life, and gave life to him.
This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one.  I must watch how he gets
rid of his spiders.

He has evidently some deep problem in his mind, for he keeps
a little notebook in which he is always jotting down something.
whole pages of it are filled with masses of figures,
generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the totals
added in batches again, as though he were focussing some account,
as the auditors put it.


8 July.--There is a method in his madness,and the rudimentary
idea in my mind is growing.  It will be a whole idea soon,
and then, oh, unconscious cerebration, you will have to give
the wall to your conscious brother.

I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I might notice if there
were any change.  Things remain as they were except that he has parted
with some of his pets and got a new one.

He has managed to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it.
His means of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminshed.
Those that do remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings
in the flies by tempting them with his food.

19 July--We are progressing.  My friend has now a whole colony of sparrows,
and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated.  When I came in he ran to me
and said he wanted to ask me a great favour, a very, very great favour.
And as he spoke, he fawned on me like a dog.

I asked him what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his
voice and bearing, ""A kitten, a nice, little, sleek playful kitten,
that I can play with, and teach, and feed, and feed, and feed!""

I was not unprepared for this request, for I had noticed
how his pets went on increasing in size and vivacity, but I
did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows should
be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and spiders.
So I said I would see about it, and asked him if he would
not rather have a cat than a kitten.

His eagerness betrayed him as he answered, ""Oh, yes, I would like a cat!
I only asked for a kitten lest you should refuse me a cat.
No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?""

I shook my head, and said that at present I feared it
would not be possible, but that I would see about it.
His face fell, and I could see a warning of danger in it,
for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant killing.
The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac.  I shall test
him with his present craving and see how it will work out,
then I shall know more.


10 pm.--I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner brooding.
When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and implored me to let
him have a cat, that his salvation depended upon it.

I was firm, however, and told him that he could not
have it, whereupon he went without a word, and sat down,
gnawing his fingers, in the corner where I had found him.
I shall see him in the morning early.


20 July.--Visited Renfield very early, before attendant went his rounds.
Found him up and humming a tune.  He was spreading out his sugar,
which he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his fly
catching again, and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace.

I looked around for his birds,and not seeing them,asked him where they were.
He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.
There were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of blood.
I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if there
were anything odd about him during the day.


11 am.--The attendant has just been to see me to say that Renfield
has been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers.
""My belief is, doctor,"" he said, ""that he has eaten his birds,
and that he just took and ate them raw!""


11 pm.--I gave Renfield a strong opiate tonight, enough to make
even him sleep, and took away his pocketbook to look at it.
The thought that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete,
and the theory proved.

My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind.  I shall have to invent a new
classification for him, and call him a zoophagous (life-eating) maniac.
What he desires is to absorb as many lives as he can, and he has laid himself
out to achieve it in a cumulative way.  He gave many flies to one spider
and many spiders to one bird, and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds.
What would have been his later steps?

It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment.
It might be done if there were only a sufficient cause.
Men sneered at vivisection, and yet look at its results today!
Why not advance science in its most difficult and vital aspect,
the knowledge of the brain?

Had I even the secret of one such mind, did I hold
the key to the fancy of even one lunatic, I might advance
my own branch of science to a pitch compared with which
Burdon-Sanderson's physiology or Ferrier's brain knowledge
would be as nothing.  If only there were a sufficient cause!
I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted.
A good cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too
be of an exceptional brain, congenitally?

How well the man reasoned.  Lunatics always do within their own scope.
I wonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one.
He has closed the account most accurately, and today begun a new record.
How many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?

To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended
with my new hope, and that truly I began a new record.
So it shall be until the Great Recorder sums me up and closes
my ledger account with a balance to profit or loss.

Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be angry
with my friend whose happiness is yours, but I must only wait
on hopeless and work.  Work!  Work!

If I could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there, a good,
unselfish cause to make me work, that would be indeed happiness.


MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL


26 July.--I am anxious,and it soothes me to express myself here.
It is like whispering to one's self and listening at the same time.
And there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it
different from writing.  I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan.
I had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned,
but yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter
from him.  I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed
had just been received.  It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula,
and says that he is just starting for home.  That is not like Jonathan.
I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy.

Then, too, Lucy , although she is so well, has lately taken to her old
habit of walking in her sleep.  Her mother has spoken to me about it,
and we have decided that I am to lock the door of our room every night.

Mrs. Westenra has got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs
of houses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened
and fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place.

Poor dear, she is naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells
me that her husband, Lucy's father, had the same habit,
that he would get up in the night and dress himself and go out,
if he were not stopped.

Lucy is to be married in the autumn, and she is already
planning out her dresses and how her house is to be arranged.
I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan and I
will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try
to make both ends meet.

Mr. Holmwood, he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only son of Lord Godalming,
is coming up here very shortly, as soon as he can leave town, for his father
is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is counting the moments till he comes.

She wants to take him up in the seat on the churchyard cliff and show him
the beauty of Whitby.  I daresay it is the waiting which disturbs her.
She will be all right when he arrives.


27 July.--No news from Jonathan.  I am getting quite uneasy about him,
though why I should I do not know, but I do wish that he would write,
if it were only a single line.

Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I am awakened by her moving about
the room.  Fortunately, the weather is so hot that she cannot get cold.
But still, the anxiety and the perpetually being awakened is beginning
to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and wakeful myself.
Thank God, Lucy's health keeps up.  Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly
called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously ill.
Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not
touch her looks.  She is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are
a lovely rose-pink. She has lost the anemic look which she had.
I pray it will all last.


3 August.--Another week gone by, and no news from Jonathan,
not even to Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard.  Oh, I do
hope he is not ill.  He surely would have written.  I look at
that last letter of his, but somehow it does not satisfy me.
It does not read like him, and yet it is his writing.
There is no mistake of that.

Lucy has not walked much in her sleep the last week,
but there is an odd concentration about her which I do
not understand, even in her sleep she seems to be watching me.
She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room
searching for the key.


6 August.--Another three days, and no news.
This suspense is getting dreadful.  If I only knew where
to write to or where to go to, I should feel easier.
But no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last letter.
I must only pray to God for patience.

Lucy is more excitable than ever, but is otherwise well.  Last night
was very threatening, and the fishermen say that we are in for a storm.
I must try to watch it and learn the weather signs.

Today is a gray day,and the sun as I write is hidden in thick clouds,
high over Kettleness.  Everything is gray except the green grass,
which seems like emerald amongst it, gray earthy rock, gray clouds,
tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the gray sea,
into which the sandpoints stretch like gray figures.  The sea is tumbling
in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar, muffled in
the sea-mists drifting inland.  The horizon is lost in a gray mist.
All vastness, the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and there
is a `brool' over the sea that sounds like some passage of doom.
Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded
in the mist, and seem `men like trees walking'. The fishing boats are
racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep
into the harbour, bending to the scuppers.  Here comes old Mr. Swales.
He is making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat,
that he wants to talk.


I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man.
When he sat down beside me, he said in a very gentle way,
""I want to say something to you, miss.""

I could see he was not at ease, so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine
and asked him to speak fully.

So he said, leaving his hand in mine, ""I'm afraid, my deary,
that I must have shocked you by all the wicked things I've been sayin'
about the dead, and such like, for weeks past, but I didn't mean them,
and I want ye to remember that when I'm gone.  We aud folks that be daffled,
and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don't altogether like to think
of it, and we don't want to feel scart of it, and that's why I've
took to makin' light of it, so that I'd cheer up my own heart a bit.
But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain't afraid of dyin', not a bit, only I
don't want to die if I can help it.  My time must be nigh at hand now,
for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to expect.
And I'm so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin' his scythe.
Ye see, I can't get out o' the habit of caffin' about it all at once.
The chafts will wag as they be used to.  Some day soon the Angel of Death
will sound his trumpet for me.  But don't ye dooal an' greet, my deary!""--
for he saw that I was crying--""if he should come this very night I'd
not refuse to answer his call.  For life be, after all, only a waitin'
for somethin' else than what we're doin', and death be all that we can
rightly depend on.  But I'm content, for it's comin' to me, my deary,
and comin' quick.  It may be comin' while we be lookin' and wonderin'. Maybe
it's in that wind out over the sea that's bringin' with it loss and wreck,
and sore distress, and sad hearts.  Look!  Look!"" he cried suddenly.
""There's something in that wind and in the hoast beyont that sounds,
and looks, and tastes, and smells like death.  It's in the air.
I feel it comin'. Lord, make me answer cheerful, when my call comes!""
He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat.  His mouth moved
as though he were praying.  After a few minutes' silence, he got up,
shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said goodbye, and hobbled off.
It all touched me, and upset me very much.

I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spyglass under his arm.
He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time kept looking
at a strange ship.

""I can't make her out,"" he said.  ""She's a Russian, by the look of her.
But she's knocking about in the queerest way.  She doesn't know
her mind a bit.  She seems to see the storm coming, but can't
decide whether to run up north in the open, or to put in here.
Look there again!  She is steered mighty strangely, for she doesn't
mind the hand on the wheel, changes about with every puff of wind.
We'll hear more of her before this time tomorrow.""




CHAPTER 7


CUTTING FROM ""THE DAILYGRAPH,"" 8 AUGUST


(PASTED IN MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL)


From a correspondent.


Whitby.


One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just
been experienced here, with results both strange and unique.
The weather had been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree
uncommon in the month of August.  Saturday evening was as fine
as was ever known, and the great body of holiday-makers laid
out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood's Bay,
Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips
in the neighborhood of Whitby.  The steamers Emma and
Scarborough made trips up and down the coast, and there was
an unusual amount of `tripping' both to and from Whitby.
The day was unusually fine till the afternoon, when some
of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff churchyard,
and from the commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea
visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden
show of `mares tails' high in the sky to the northwest.
The wind was then blowing from the south-west in the mild degree
which in barometrical language is ranked `No. 2, light breeze.'

The coastguard on duty at once made report, and one old fisherman,
who for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from
the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm.
The approach of sunset was so very beautiful, so grand in its masses
of splendidly coloured clouds, that there was quite an assemblage on
the walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty.
Before the sun dipped below the black mass of Kettleness, standing boldly
athwart the western sky, its downward was was marked by myriad clouds of every
sunset colour, flame, purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold,
with here and there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness,
in all sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes.
The experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of
the sketches of the `Prelude to the Great Storm' will grace the R. A
and R. I. walls in May next.

More than one captain made up his mind then and there that his
`cobble' or his `mule', as they term the different classes
of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.
The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there
was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which,
on the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature.

There were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the
coasting steamers, which usually hug the shore so closely,
kept well to seaward,and but few fishing boats were in sight.
The only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with
all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards.
The foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific
theme for comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were
made to signal her to reduce sail in the face of her danger.
Before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapping
as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea.

""As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.""


Shortly before ten o'clock the stillness of the air grew quite
oppressive,and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep
inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard,
and the band on the pier, with its lively French air,
was like a dischord in the great harmony of nature's silence.
A little after midnight came a strange sound from over the sea, and high
overhead the air began to carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.

Then without warning the tempest broke.  With a rapidity which,
at the time, seemed incredible,and even afterwards is impossible
to realize, the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed.
The waves rose in growing fury, each over-topping its fellow,
till in a very few minutes the lately glassy sea was like
a roaring and devouring monster.  White-crested waves beat
madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs.
Others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept
the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end
of either pier of Whitby Harbour.

The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such force that it
was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,
or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions.  It was found
necessary to clear the entire pier from the mass of onlookers,
or else the fatalities of the night would have increased manifold.
To add to the difficulties and dangers of the time,
masses of sea-fog came drifting inland.  White, wet clouds,
which swept by in ghostly fashion, so dank and damp and cold
that it needed but little effort of imagination to think that
the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living
brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many a one shuddered
at the wreaths of sea-mist swept by.

At times the mist cleared, and the sea for some distance could
be seen in the glare of the lightning, which came thick and fast,
followed by such peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed
trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm.

Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur
and of absorbing interest.  The sea, running mountains high,
threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam,
which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space.
Here and there a fishing boat, with a rag of sail, running madly
for shelter before the blast, now and again the white wings of a
storm-tossed seabird.  On the summit of the East Cliff the new
searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been tried.
The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in
the pauses of onrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.
Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing boat,
with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance
of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers.
As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy
from the mass of people on the shore,a shout which for a moment
seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.

Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner
with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed
earlier in the evening.  The wind had by this time backed to the east,
and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized
the terrible danger in which she now was.

Between her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many good
ships have from time to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from
its present quarter, it would be quite impossible that she should fetch
the entrance of the harbour.

It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so great
that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible,
and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such speed that,
in the words of one old salt, ""she must fetch up somewhere, if it was only
in hell"". Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than any hitherto,
a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things like a gray pall,
and left available to men only the organ of hearing, for the roar of
the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the booming of the mighty
billows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before.
The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across
the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited breathless.

The wind suddenly shifted to the northeast, and the remnant
of the sea fog melted in the blast.  And then, mirabile dictu,
between the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at
headlong speed, swept the strange schooner before the blast,
with all sail set, and gained the safety of the harbour.
The searchlight followed her, and a shudder ran through all who
saw her, for lashed to the helm was a corpse, with drooping head,
which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship.
No other form could be seen on the deck at all.

A great awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle,
had found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man!
However, all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words.
The schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself
on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many
storms into the southeast corner of the pier jutting under the East Cliff,
known locally as Tate Hill Pier.

There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel
drove up on the sand heap.  Every spar, rope, and stay was
strained,and some of the `top-hammer' came crashing down.
But, strangest of all, the very instant the shore was touched,
an immense dog sprang up on deck from below,as if shot up
by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow
on the sand.

Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard hangs over
the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstones,
thruffsteans or through-stones, as they call them in Whitby vernacular,
actually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away,
it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed intensified just beyond
the focus of the searchlight.

It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate
Hill Pier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity
were either in bed or were out on the heights above.
Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour,
who at once ran down to the little pier, was the first to
climb aboard.  The men working the searchlight, after scouring
the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything,
then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there.
The coastguard ran aft, and when he came beside the wheel,
bent over to examine it,and recoiled at once as though under
some sudden emotion.  This seemed to pique general curiosity,
and quite a number of people began to run.

It is a good way round from the West Cliff by the Draw-bridge to Tate
Hill Pier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead
of the crowd.  When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier
a crowd, whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board.
By the courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent,
permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead
seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel.

It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised,
or even awed, for not often can such a sight have been seen.
The man was simply fastened by his hands, tied one over the other,
to a spoke of the wheel.  Between the inner hand and the wood was
a crucifix, the set of beads on which it was fastened being around
both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by the binding cords.
The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but the flapping
and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder
of the wheel and had dragged him to and fro, so that the cords
with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone.

Accurate note was made of the state of things, and a doctor,
Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot Place, who came
immediately after me, declared, after making examination,
that the man must have been dead for quite two days.

In his pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little
roll of paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log.

The coastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands,
fastening the knots with his teeth.  The fact that a coastguard
was the first on board may save some complications later on,
in the Admiralty Court, for coastguards cannot claim the salvage
which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict.
Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young
law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner
are already completely sacrificed, his property being held
in contravention of the statues of mortmain, since the tiller,
as emblemship, if not proof, of delegated possession, is held
in a dead hand.

It is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently removed
from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till death,
a steadfastness as noble as that of the young Casabianca, and placed
in the mortuary to await inquest.

Already the sudden storm is passing,and its fierceness is abating.
Crowds are scattering backward, and the sky is beginning to redden
over the Yorkshire wolds.

I shall send, in time for your next issue, further details of the derelict
ship which found her way so miraculously into harbour in the storm.


9 August.--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in
the storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself.
It turns out that the schooner is Russian from Varna, and is called
the Demeter.  She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand,
with only a small amount of cargo, a number of great wooden boxes
filled with mould.

This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S.F. Billington,
of 7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and took formal
possession of the goods consigned to him.

The Russian consul, too, acting for the charter-party, took formal
possession of the ship, and paid all harbour dues, etc.

Nothing is talked about here today except the strange coincidence.
The officials of the Board of Trade have been most exacting in seeing
that every compliance has been made with existing regulations.
As the matter is to be a `nine days wonder', they are evidently
determined that there shall be no cause of other complaint.

A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which landed
when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the S.P.C.A.,
which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the animal.
To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found.
It seems to have disappeared entirely from the town.
It may be that it was frightened and made its way on to the moors,
where it is still hiding in terror.

There are some who look with dread on such a possibility,
lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it
is evidently a fierce brute.  Early this morning a large dog,
a half-bred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate
Hill Pier, was found dead in the roadway opposite its master's yard.
It had been fighting, and manifestly had had a savage opponent,
for its throat was torn away, and its belly was slit open
as if with a savage claw.


Later.--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector,
I have been permitted to look over the log book of the Demeter,
which was in order up to within three days, but contained
nothing of special interest except as to facts of missing men.
The greatest interest, however, is with regard to the paper
found in the bottle, which was today produced at the inquest.
And a more strange narrative than the two between them unfold
it has not been my lot to come across.

As there is no motive for concealment, I am permitted
to use them, and accordingly send you a transcript,
simply omitting technical details of seamanship and supercargo.
It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with
some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water,
and that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage.
Of course my statement must be taken cum grano, since I am
writing from the dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul,
who kindly translated for me, time being short.

LOG OF THE ""DEMETER"" Varna to Whitby


Written 18 July, things so strange happening, that I shall keep
accurate note henceforth till we land.


On 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth.
At noon set sail.  East wind, fresh.  Crew, five hands.
. .two mates, cook, and myself, (captain).


On 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus.  Boarded by Turkish
Customs officers.  Backsheesh.  All correct.  Under way at
4 p.  m.


On 12 July through Dardanelles.  More Customs officers
and flagboat of guarding squadron.  Backsheesh again.
Work of officers thorough, but quick.  Want us off soon.
At dark passed into Archipelago.


On 13 July passed Cape Matapan.  Crew dissatisfied about something.
Seemed scared, but would not speak out.


On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew.  Men all steady fellows,
who sailed with me before.  Mate could not make out what was wrong.
They only told him there was SOMETHING, and crossed themselves.
Mate lost temper with one of them that day and struck him.
Expected fierce quarrel, but all was quiet.


On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of the crew, Petrofsky,
was missing.  Could not account for it.  Took larboard watch eight
bells last night, was relieved by Amramoff, but did not go to bunk.
Men more downcast than ever.  All said they expected something
of the kind, but would not say more than there was SOMETHING aboard.
Mate getting very impatient with them.  Feared some trouble ahead.


On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin,
and in an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange
man aboard the ship.  He said that in his watch he had been sheltering
behind the deckhouse, as there was a rain storm, when he saw a tall,
thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companionway,
and go along the deck forward and disappear.  He followed cautiously,
but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed.
He was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic
may spread.  To allay it, I shall today search the entire ship carefully
from stem to stern.


Later in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them,
as they evidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would
search from stem to stern.  First mate angry, said it was folly,
and to yield to such foolish ideas would demoralise the men,
said he would engage to keep them out of trouble with the handspike.
I let him take the helm, while the rest began a thorough search,
all keeping abreast, with lanterns.  We left no corner unsearched.
As there were only the big wooden boxes, there were no odd corners
where a man could hide.  Men much relieved when search over, and went
back to work cheerfully.  First mate scowled, but said nothing.


22 July.--Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with sails,
no time to be frightened.  Men seem to have forgotten their dread.
Mate cheerful again, and all on good terms.  Praised men for work
in bad weather.  Passed Gibraltar and out through Straits.  All well.


24 July.--There seems some doom over this ship.
Already a hand short, and entering the Bay of Biscay with wild
weather ahead, and yet last night another man lost, disappeared.
Like the first, he came off his watch and was not seen again.
Men all in a panic of fear, sent a round robin, asking to
have double watch, as they fear to be alone.  Mate angry.
Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men
will do some violence.


28 July.--Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of malestrom,
and the wind a tempest.  No sleep for any one.  Men all worn out.
Hardly know how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on.
Second mate volunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch a few
hours sleep.  Wind abating, seas still terrific, but feel them less,
as ship is steadier.


29 July.--Another tragedy.  Had single watch tonight,
as crew too tired to double.  When morning watch came on
deck could find no one except steersman.  Raised outcry,
and all came on deck.  Thorough search, but no one found.
Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic.
Mate and I agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any
sign of cause.


30 July.--Last night.  Rejoiced we are nearing England.
Weather fine, all sails set.  Retired worn out, slept soundly,
awakened by mate telling me that both man of watch and steersman missing.
Only self and mate and two hands left to work ship.


1 August.--Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted.  Had hoped when in
the English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere.
Not having power to work sails, have to run before wind.
Dare not lower, as could not raise them again.  We seem to be drifting
to some terrible doom.  Mate now more demoralised than either of men.
His stronger nature seems to have worked inwardly against himself.
Men are beyond fear, working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up
to worst.  They are Russian, he Roumanian.


2 August, midnight.--Woke up from few minutes sleep by hearing
a cry, seemingly outside my port.  Could see nothing in fog.
Rushed on deck, and ran against mate.  Tells me he heard cry and ran,
but no sign of man on watch.  One more gone.  Lord, help us!
Mate says we must be past Straits of Dover, as in a moment of fog
lifting he saw North Foreland, just as he heard the man cry out.
If so we are now off in the North Sea, and only God can guide
us in the fog, which seems to move with us, and God seems to
have deserted us.


3 August.--At midnight I went to relieve the man at
the wheel and when I got to it found no one there.
The wind was steady, and as we ran before it there was
no yawing.  I dared not leave it, so shouted for the mate.
After a few seconds, he rushed up on deck in his flannels.
He looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason
has given way.  He came close to me and whispered hoarsely,
with his mouth to my ear, as though fearing the very air might hear.
""It is here.  I know it now.  On the watch last night I
saw It, like a man, tall and thin, and ghastly pale.
It was in the bows, and looking out.  I crept behind It, and gave
it my knife, but the knife went through It, empty as the air.""
And as he spoke he took the knife and drove it savagely into space.
Then he went on, ""But It is here, and I'll find It.
It is in the hold, perhaps in one of those boxes.
I'll unscrew them one by one and see.  You work the helm.""
And with a warning look and his finger on his lip, he went below.
There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could not leave
the helm.  I saw him come out on deck again with a tool
chest and lantern, and go down the forward hatchway.
He is mad, stark, raving mad, and it's no use my trying to stop him.
He can't hurt those big boxes, they are invoiced as clay,
and to pull them about is as harmless a thing as he can do.
So here I stay and mind the helm, and write these notes.
I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears.
Then, if I can't steer to any harbour with the wind that is,
I shall cut down sails, and lie by, and signal for help.  . .

It is nearly all over now.  Just as I was beginning to hope
that the mate would come out calmer, for I heard him knocking away
at something in the hold, and work is good for him, there came up
the hatchway a sudden, startled scream, which made my blood run cold,
and up on the deck he came as if shot from a gun, a raging madman,
with his eyes rolling and his face convulsed with fear.  ""Save me!
Save me!"" he cried, and then looked round on the blanket of fog.
His horror turned to despair, and in a steady voice he said,
""You had better come too, captain, before it is too late.  He is there!
I know the secret now.  The sea will save me from Him, and it is all
that is left!""  Before I could say a word, or move forward to seize him,
he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into the sea.
I suppose I know the secret too, now.  It was this madman who had got
rid of the men one by one, and now he has followed them himself.
God help me!  How am I to account for all these horrors when I get
to port?  When I get to port!  Will that ever be?


4 August.--Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce, I know
there is sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not.
I dared not go below, I dared not leave the helm, so here all
night I stayed, and in the dimness of the night I saw it, Him!
God, forgive me, but the mate was right to jump overboard.
It was better to die like a man.  To die like a sailor in blue water,
no man can object.  But I am captain, and I must not leave my ship.
But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie my
hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along
with them I shall tie that which He, It, dare not touch.
And then, come good wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour
as a captain.  I am growing weaker, and the night is coming on.
If He can look me in the face again, I may not have time to act.
. . If we are wrecked, mayhap this bottle may be found,
and those who find it may understand.  If not.  . .well,
then all men shall know that I have been true to my trust.
God and the Blessed Virgin and the Saints help a poor ignorant
soul trying to do his duty.  . .


Of course the verdict was an open one.  There is no evidence to adduce,
and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there
is now none to say.  The folk here hold almost universally that
the captain is simply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral.
Already it is arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats
up the Esk for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up
the abbey steps, for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff.
The owners of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names
as wishing to follow him to the grave.

No trace has ever been found of the great dog, at which
there is much mourning, for, with public opinion in its
present state, he would, I believe, be adopted by the town.
Tomorrow will see the funeral, and so will end this one more
`mystery of the sea'.



MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL


8 August.--Lucy was very restless all night, and I too,
could not sleep.  The storm was fearful, and as it boomed
loudly among the chimney pots, it made me shudder.
When a sharp puff came it seemed to be like a distant gun.
Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake, but she got up twice and
dressed herself.  Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and managed
to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed.
It is a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon
as her will is thwarted in any physical way, her intention,
if there be any, disappears, and she yields herself almost
exactly to the routine of her life.

Early in the morning we both got up and went down to
the harbour to see if anything had happened in the night.
There were very few people about, and though the sun was bright,
and the air clear and fresh, the big, grim-looking waves,
that seemed dark themselves because the foam that topped
them was like snow, forced themselves in through the mouth
of the harbour, like a bullying man going through a crowd.
Somehow I felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea
last night, but on land.  But, oh, is he on land or sea?
Where is he, and how?  I am getting fearfully anxious about him.
If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!


10 August.--The funeral of the poor sea captain today was most touching.
Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin was carried
by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the churchyard.
Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst the cortege
of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down again.
We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.
The poor fellow was laid to rest near our seat so that we stood on it,
when the time came and saw everything.

Poor Lucy seemed much upset.  She was restless and uneasy all the time,
and I cannot but think that her dreaming at night is telling on her.
She is quite odd in one thing.  She will not admit to me that there is any
cause for restlessness, or if there be, she does not understand it herself.

There is an additional cause in that poor Mr. Swales was
found dead this morning on our seat, his neck being broken.
He had evidently, as the doctor said, fallen back in the seat
in some sort of fright, for there was a look of fear and
horror on his face that the men said made them shudder.
Poor dear old man!

Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely
than other people do.  Just now she was quite upset by a little thing
which I did not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals.

One of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was
followed by his dog.  The dog is always with him.  They are both
quiet persons, and I never saw the man angry, nor heard the dog bark.
During the service the dog would not come to its master, who was on
the seat with us, but kept a few yards off, barking and howling.
Its master spoke to it gently, and then harshly, and then angrily.
But it would neither come nor cease to make a noise.  It was in a fury,
with its eyes savage, and all its hair bristling out like a cat's
tail when puss is on the war path.

Finally the man too got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog,
and then took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged
and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed.
The moment it touched the stone the poor thing began to tremble.
It did not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering,
and was in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried,
though without effect, to comfort it.

Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to touch the dog,
but looked at it in an agonised sort of way.  I greatly fear that she is
of too super sensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble.
She will be dreaming of this tonight, I am sure.  The whole agglomeration
of things, the ship steered into port by a dead man, his attitude,
tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads, the touching funeral, the dog,
now furious and now in terror, will all afford material for her dreams.

I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I
shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood's Bay and back.
She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.





CHAPTER 8


MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL


Same day, 11 o'clock P.M.--Oh, but I am tired!  If it were not
that I had made my diary a duty I should not open it tonight.
We had a lovely walk.  Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits,
owing, I think, to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a
field close to the lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us.
I believe we forgot everything, except of course, personal fear,
and it seemed to wipe the slate clean and give us a fresh start.
We had a capital `severe tea' at Robin Hood's Bay in a sweet little
old-fashioned inn, with a bow window right over the seaweed-covered
rocks of the strand.  I believe we should have shocked the `New Woman'
with our appetites.  Men are more tolerant, bless them!
Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,
and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls.

Lucy was really tired, and we intended to creep off
to bed as soon as we could.  The young curate came in,
however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay for supper.
Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller.
I know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic.
I think that some day the bishops must get together and see
about breeding up a new class of curates, who don't take supper,
no matter how hard they may be pressed to, and who will know
when girls are tired.

Lucy is asleep and breathing softly.  She has more color
in her cheeks than usual, and looks, oh so sweet.
If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her only in the
drawing room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.
Some of the `New Women' writers will some day start an idea
that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep
before proposing or accepting.  But I suppose the `New Woman'
won't condescend in future to accept.  She will do the
proposing herself.  And a nice job she will make of it too!
There's some consolation in that.  I am so happy tonight,
because dear Lucy seems better.  I really believe she has turned
the corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming.
I should be quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.
. .God bless and keep him.


11 August.--Diary again.  No sleep now, so I may as well write.
I am too agitated to sleep.  We have had such an adventure,
such an agonizing experience.  I fell asleep as soon as I had closed
my diary.  . . Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a
horrible sense of fear upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness
around me.  The room was dark, so I could not see Lucy's bed.
I stole across and felt for her.  The bed was empty.
I lit a match and found that she was not in the room.
The door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it.
I feared to wake her mother, who has been more than usually
ill lately, so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for her.
As I was leaving the room it struck me that the clothes she
wore might give me some clue to her dreaming intention.
Dressing-gown would mean house, dress outside.
Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places.
""Thank God,"" I said to myself, ""she cannot be far, as she
is only in her nightdress.""

I ran downstairs and looked in the sitting room.
Not there!  Then I looked in all the other rooms of
the house, with an ever-growing fear chilling my heart.
Finally, I came to the hall door and found it open.
It was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught.
The people of the house are careful to lock the door every night,
so I feared that Lucy must have gone out as she was.
There was no time to think of what might happen.
A vague over-mastering fear obscured all details.

I took a big, heavy shawl and ran out.  The clock was striking
one as I was in the Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight.
I ran along the North Terrace, but could see no sign of the white
figure which I expected.  At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier
I looked across the harbour to the East Cliff, in the hope or fear,
I don't know which, of seeing Lucy in our favorite seat.

There was a bright full moon, with heavy black, driving clouds,
which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade
as they sailed across.  For a moment or two I could see nothing,
as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary's Church and all around it.
Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view,
and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword-cut moved along,
the church and churchyard became gradually visible.  Whatever my
expectation was, it was not disappointed, for there, on our favorite seat,
the silver light of the moon struck a half-reclining figure, snowy white.
The coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much, for shadow shut
down on light almost immediately, but it seemed to me as though something
dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it.
What it was, whether man or beast, I could not tell.

I did not wait to catch another glance, but flew down the steep steps to
the pier and along by the fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way
to reach the East Cliff.  The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see.
I rejoiced that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy's condition.
The time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath
came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey.  I must have
gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with lead,
and as though every joint in my body were rusty.

When I got almost to the top I could see the seat and the
white figure, for I was now close enough to distinguish it even
through the spells of shadow.  There was undoubtedly something,
long and black, bending over the half-reclining white figure.
I called in fright, ""Lucy!  Lucy!"" and something raised a head,
and from where I was I could see a white face and red, gleaming eyes.

Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the entrance of the churchyard.
As I entered, the church was between me and the seat, and for a minute
or so I lost sight of her.  When I came in view again the cloud
had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that I could see
Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back of the seat.
She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living thing about.

When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep.
Her lips were parted, and she was breathing, not softly as
usual with her, but in long, heavy gasps, as though striving
to get her lungs full at every breath.  As I came close,
she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar of her
nightdress close around her, as though she felt the cold.
I flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight around
her neck, for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill
from the night air, unclad as she was.  I feared to wake her
all at once, so, in order to have my hands free to help her,
I fastened the shawl at her throat with a big safety pin.
But I must have been clumsy in my anxiety and pinched
or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing
became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned.
When I had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet,
and then began very gently to wake her.

At first she did not respond, but gradually she became more
and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing occasionally.
At last, as time was passing fast, and for many other reasons,
I wished to get her home at once, I shook her forcibly,
till finally she opened her eyes and awoke.  She did not seem
surprised to see me, as, of course, she did not realize all
at once where she was.

Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body
must have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at
waking unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace.
She trembled a little, and clung to me.  When I told her to come at once
with me home, she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child.
As we passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince.
She stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes, but I would not.
However, when we got to the pathway outside the chruchyard, where there
was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with mud,
using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no one,
in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.

Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul.  Once we saw
a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of us.
But we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as there
are here, steep little closes, or `wynds', as they call them in Scotland.
My heart beat so loud all the time sometimes I thought I should faint.
I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her health,
lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation in case
the story should get wind.  When we got in, and had washed our feet,
and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into bed.
Before falling asleep she asked, even implored, me not to say a word
to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure.

I hesitated at first, to promise, but on thinking of the state of her
mother's health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,
and think too, of how such a story might become distorted, nay,
infallibly would, in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do so.
I hope I did right.  I have locked the door, and the key is tied to my wrist,
so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed.  Lucy is sleeping soundly.
The reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea.  . .


Same day, noon.--All goes well.  Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed
not to have even changed her side.  The adventure of the night does
not seem to have harmed her, on the contrary, it has benefited her,
for she looks better this morning than she has done for weeks.
I was sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her.
Indeed, it might have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced.
I must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it,
for there are two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band
of her nightdress was a drop of blood.  When I apologised and was concerned
about it, she laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it.
Fortunately it cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.


Same day, night.--We passed a happy day.  The air was clear,
and the sun bright, and there was a cool breeze.  We took our lunch
to Mulgrave Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy
and I walking by the cliff-path and joining her at the gate.
I felt a little sad myself, for I could not but feel how
absolutely happy it would have been had Jonathan been with me.
But there!  I must only be patient.  In the evening we strolled
in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr
and Mackenzie, and went to bed early.  Lucy seems more restful
than she has been for some time, and fell asleep at once.
I shall lock the door and secure the key the same as before,
though I do not expect any trouble tonight.


12 August.--My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I
was wakened by Lucy trying to get out.  She seemed, even in her sleep,
to be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back
to bed under a sort of protest.  I woke with the dawn, and heard
the birds chirping outside of the window.  Lucy woke, too, and I
was glad to see, was even better than on the previous morning.
All her old gaiety of manner seemed to have come back, and she
came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about Arthur.
I told her how anxious I was about Jonathan, and then she tried
to comfort me.  Well, she succeeded somewhat, for, though sympathy
can't alter facts, it can make them more bearable.


13 August.--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my
wrist as before.  Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy
sitting up in bed, still asleep, pointing to the window.
I got up quietly, and pulling aside the blind, looked out.
It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft effect of the light
over the sea and sky, merged together in one great silent mystery,
was beautiful beyond words.  Between me and the moonlight flitted
a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles.
Once or twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose,
frightened at seeing me, and flitted away across the harbour
towards the abbey.  When I came back from the window
Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.
She did not stir again all night.


14 August.--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day.
Lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot as I am,
and it is hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home
for lunch or tea or dinner.  This afternoon she made a funny remark.
We were coming home for dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up
from the West Pier and stopped to look at the view, as we generally do.
The setting sun, low down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness.
The red light was thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey,
and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow.  We were silent
for a while, and suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself.  . .

""His red eyes again!  They are just the same.""  It was such an
odd expression, coming apropos of nothing, that it quite startled me.
I slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming
to stare at her, and saw that she was in a half dreamy state,
with an odd look on her face that I could not quite make out,
so I said nothing, but followed her eyes.  She appeared to be looking
over at our own seat, whereon was a dark figure seated alone.
I was quite a little startled myself, for it seemed for an
instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames,
but a second look dispelled the illusion.  The red sunlight
was shining on the windows of St. Mary's Church behind our seat,
and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the
refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved.
I called Lucy's attention to the peculiar effect, and she
became herself with a start, but she looked sad all the same.
It may have been that she was thinking of that terrible night up there.
We never refer to it, so I said nothing, and we went home to dinner.
Lucy had a headache and went early to bed.  I saw her asleep,
and went out for a little stroll myself.

I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of
sweet sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan.  When coming home,
it was then bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front
of our part of the Crescent was in shadow, everything could
be well seen, I threw a glance up at our window, and saw Lucy's
head leaning out.  I opened my handkerchief and waved it.
She did not notice or make any movement whatever.  Just then,
the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light
fell on the window.  There distinctly was Lucy with her head
lying up against the side of the window sill and her eyes shut.
She was fast asleep, and by her, seated on the window sill,
was something that looked like a good-sized bird.
I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs, but as I
came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast asleep,
and breathing heavily.  She was holding her hand to her throat,
as though to protect if from the cold.

I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly.  I have taken care
that the door is locked and the window securely fastened.

She looks so sweet as she sleeps, but she is paler than is her wont,
and there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like.
I fear she is fretting about something.  I wish I could find out what it is.


15 August.--Rose later than usual.  Lucy was languid and tired, and slept
on after we had been called.  We had a happy surprise at breakfast.
Arthur's father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon.
Lucy is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once.
Later on in the day she told me the cause.  She is grieved to lose Lucy
as her very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to
protect her.  Poor dear, sweet lady!  She confided to me that she has got
her death warrant.  She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy.
Her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die,
for her heart is weakening.  At any time, even now, a sudden shock would
be almost sure to kill her.  Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair
of the dreadful night of Lucy's sleep-walking.


17 August.--No diary for two whole days.  I have not had the heart to write.
Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.
No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker,
whilst her mother's hours are numbering to a close.  I do not understand
Lucy's fading away as she is doing.  She eats well and sleeps well,
and enjoys the fresh air, but all the time the roses in her cheeks
are fading, and she gets weaker and more languid day by day.
At night I hear her gasping as if for air.

I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at night,
but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open window.
Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I tried
to wake her I could not.

She was in a faint.  When I managed to restore her, she was weak as water,
and cried silently between long, painful struggles for breath.
When I asked her how she came to be at the window she shook her head
and turned away.

I trust her feeling ill may not be from that unlucky prick
of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat just now as she
lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.
They are still open, and, if anything, larger than before,
and the edges of them are faintly white.  They are like little
white dots with red centres.  Unless they heal within a day
or two, I shall insist on the doctor seeing about them.

MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL.


18 August.--I am happy today, and write sitting on the seat
in the churchyard.  Lucy is ever so much better.  Last night
she slept well all night, and did not disturb me once.

The roses seem coming back already to her cheeks,
though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she were
in any way anemic I could understand it, but she is not.
She is in gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness.
All the morbid reticence seems to have passed from her,
and she has just reminded me, as if I needed any reminding,
of that night, and that it was here, on this very seat,
I found her asleep.

As she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her boot
on the stone slab and said,

""My poor little feet didn't make much noise then!
I daresay poor old Mr. Swales would have told me that it was
because I didn't want to wake up Geordie.""

As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she
had dreamed at all that night.

Before she answered, that sweet, puckered look came into
her forehead, which Arthur, I call him Arthur from her habit,
says he loves, and indeed, I don't wonder that he does.
Then she went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying
to recall it to herself.

""I didn't quite dream, but it all seemed to be real.
I only wanted to be here in this spot.  I don't know why, for I was
afraid of something, I don't know what.  I remember, though I suppose
I was asleep, passing through the streets and over the bridge.
A fish leaped as I went by, and I leaned over to look at it,
and I heard a lot of dogs howling.  The whole town seemed as if it
must be full of dogs all howling at once, as I went up the steps.
Then I had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes,
just as we saw in the sunset, and something very sweet and very bitter
all around me at once.  And then I seemed sinking into deep green water,
and there was a singing in my ears, as I have heard there is to
drowning men, and then everything seemed passing away from me.
My soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.
I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me,
and then there was a sort of agonizing feeling, as if I were
in an earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body.
I saw you do it before I felt you.""

Then she began to laugh.  It seemed a little uncanny to me,
and I listened to her breathlessly.  I did not quite like it,
and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we
drifted on to another subject, and Lucy was like her old self again.
When we got home the fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale
cheeks were really more rosy.  Her mother rejoiced when she saw her,
and we all spent a very happy evening together.


19 August.--Joy, joy, joy!  Although not all joy.  At last, news of Jonathan.
The dear fellow has been ill, that is why he did not write.
I am not afraid to think it or to say it, now that I know.
Mr. Hawkins sent me on the letter, and wrote himself, oh so kindly.
I am to leave in the morning and go over to Jonathan, and to help
to nurse him if necessary, and to bring him home.  Mr. Hawkins says
it would not be a bad thing if we were to be married out there.
I have cried over the good Sister's letter till I can feel it wet against
my bosom, where it lies.  It is of Jonathan, and must be near my heart,
for he is in my heart.  My journey is all mapped out, and my luggage ready.
I am only taking one change of dress.  Lucy will bring my trunk
to London and keep it till I send for it, for it may be that.
. .I must write no more.  I must keep it to say to Jonathan, my husband.
The letter that he has seen and touched must comfort me till we meet.

LETTER, SISTER AGATHA, HOSPITAL OF ST.  JOSEPH AND STE.
MARY BUDA-PESTH, TO MISS WILLHELMINA MURRAY

12 August,

""Dear Madam.

""I write by desire of Mr. Jonathan Harker, who is himself not
strong enough to write, though progressing well, thanks to God
and St. Joseph and Ste.  Mary.  He has been under our care
for nearly six weeks, suffering from a violent brain fever.
He wishes me to convey his love, and to say that by this post
I write for him to Mr. Peter Hawkins, Exeter, to say, with his
dutiful respects, that he is sorry for his delay, and that all
of his work is completed.  He will require some few weeks'
rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but will then return.
He wishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him,
and that he would like to pay for his staying here, so that
others who need shall not be wanting for belp.

Believe me,

Yours, with sympathy

and all blessings.  Sister Agatha""


""P.S.--My patient being asleep, I open this to let you know something more.
He has told me all about you, and that you are shortly to be his wife.
All blessings to you both!  He has had some fearful shock, so says our doctor,
and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful, of wolves and poison
and blood, of ghosts and demons, and I fear to say of what.  Be careful of him
always that there may be nothing to excite him of this kind for a long time
to come.  The traces of such an illness as his do not lightly die away.
We should have written long ago, but we knew nothing of his friends,
and there was nothing on him, nothing that anyone could understand.
He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard was told by the station
master there that he rushed into the station shouting for a ticket for home.
Seeing from his violent demeanor that he was English, they gave him a ticket
for the furthest station on the way thither that the train reached.

""Be assured that he is well cared for.  He has won all hearts
by his sweetness and gentleness.  He is truly getting on well,
and I have no doubt will in a few weeks be all himself.
But be careful of him for safety's sake.  There are, I pray
God and St. Joseph and Ste.  Mary, many, many, happy years
for you both.""

DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


19 Agust.--Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night.
About eight o'clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a
dog does when setting.  The attendant was struck by his manner,
and knowing my interest in him, encouraged him to talk.
He is usually respectful to the attendant and at times servile,
but tonight, the man tells me, he was quite haughty.
Would not condescend to talk with him at all.

All he would say was, ""I don't want to talk to you.  You don't count now.
The master is at hand.""

The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which
has seized him.  If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong
man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous.
The combination is a dreadful one.

At Nine o'clock I visited him myself.  His attitude to me was the same as that
to the attendant.  In his sublime self-feeling the difference between myself
and the attendant seemed to him as nothing.  It looks like religious mania,
and he will soon think that he himself is God.

These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man are too paltry
for an Omnipotent Being.  How these madmen give themselves away!
The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall.  But the God created
from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow.
Oh, if men only knew!

For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and
greater degree.  I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict
observation all the same.  All at once that shifty look came into his eyes
which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it the shifty
movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to know so well.
He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly,
and looked into space with lack-luster eyes.

I thought I would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed,
and tried to lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed
to excite his attention.

At first he made no reply, but at length said testily, ""Bother them all!
I don't care a pin about them.""

""What"" I said.  ""You don't mean to tell me you don't care about spiders?""
(Spiders at present are his hobby and the notebook is filling up with columns
of small figures.)

To this he answered enigmatically, ""The Bride maidens rejoice the eyes
that wait the coming of the bride.  But when the bride draweth nigh,
then the maidens shine not to the eyes that are filled.""

He would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated
on his bed all the time I remained with him.

I am weary tonight and low in spirits.  I cannot but think
of Lucy, and how different things might have been.
If I don't sleep at once, chloral, the modern Morpheus!
I must be careful not to let it grow into a habit.
No, I shall take none tonight!  I have thought of Lucy,
and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two.  If need by,
tonight shall be sleepless.


Later.--Glad I made the resolution, gladder that I kept to it.
I had lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice,
when the night watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say
that Renfield had escaped.  I threw on my clothes and ran down at once.
My patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about.
Those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers.

The attendant was waiting for me.  He said he had seen him not
ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his bed, when he had
looked through the observation trap in the door.  His attention
was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out.
He ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window,
and had at once sent up for me.  He was only in his night gear,
and cannot be far off.

The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch
where he should go than to follow him, as he might lose sight
of him whilst getting out of the building by the door.
He is a bulky man, and couldn't get through the window.

I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost,
and as we were only a few feet above ground landed unhurt.

The attendant told me the patient had gone to the left,
and had taken a straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could.
As I got through the belt of trees I saw a white figure scale
the high wall which separates our grounds from those of
the deserted house.

I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men immediately and
follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend might be dangerous.
I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall, dropped down on the other side.
I could see Renfield's figure just disappearing behind the angle of the house,
so I ran after him.  On the far side of the house I found him pressed close
against the old iron-bound oak door of the chapel.

He was talking, apparently to some one, but I was afraid to go near
enough to hear what he was saying, les t I might frighten him,
and he should run off.

Chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following
a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping is upon him!
After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not take note
of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to him,
the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him in.
I heard him say.  . .

""I am here to do your bidding, Master.  I am your slave, and you will
reward me, for I shall be faithful.  I have worshipped you long and afar off.
Now that you are near, I await your commands, and you will not pass me by,
will you, dear Master, in your distribution of good things?""

He is a selfish old beggar anyhow.  He thinks of the loaves
and fishes even when he believes his is in a real Presence.
His manias make a startling combination.  When we closed
in on him he fought like a tiger.  He is immensely strong,
for he was more like a wild beast than a man.

I never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before,
and I hope I shall not again.  It is a mercy that we
have found out his strength and his danger in good time.
With strength and determination like his, he might have done
wild work before he was caged.

He is safe now, at any rate.  Jack Sheppard himself couldn't
get free from the strait waistcoat that keeps him restrained,
and he's chained to the wall in the padded room.

His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are more
deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.

Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time.
""I shall be patient, Master.  It is coming, coming, coming!""

So I took the hint, and came too.  I was too excited to sleep, but this
diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep tonight.




CHAPTER 9


LETTER, MINA HARKER TO LUCY WESTENRA


Buda-Pesth, 24 August.

""My dearest Lucy,

""I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we
parted at the railway station at Whitby.

""Well, my dear, I got to Hull all right, and caught the boat
to Hamburg, and then the train on here.  I feel that I can
hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I knew
I was coming to Jonathan, and that as I should have to do
some nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.
I found my dear one, oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All
the resolution has gone out of his dear eyes, and that quiet
dignity which I told you was in his face has vanished.
He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not remember
anything that has happened to him for a long time past.
At least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask.

""He has had some terrible shock, and I fear it might
tax his poor brain if he were to try to recall it.
Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse,
tells me that he wanted her to tell me what they were,
but she would only cross herself, and say she would never tell.
That the ravings of the sick were the secrets of God,
and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear them,
she should respect her trust..

""She is a sweet, good soul, and the next day, when she saw
I was troubled, she opened up the subject my poor dear
raved about, added, `I can tell you this much, my dear.
That it was not about anything which he has done wrong himself,
and you, as his wife to be, have no cause to be concerned.
He has not forgotten you or what he owes to you.
His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal
can treat of.'

""I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest
my poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl.
The idea of my being jealous about Jonathan!  And yet, my dear,
let me whisper, I felt a thrill of joy through me when I knew
that no other woman was a cause for trouble.  I am now sitting
by his bedside, where I can see his face while he sleeps.
He is waking!

""When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something
from the pocket.  I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.
I saw amongst them was his notebook, and was was going to ask him to let
me look at it, for I knew that I might find some clue to his trouble,
but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent me
over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.

""Then he called me back, and he said to me very solemnly,
`Wilhelmina', I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has
never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him,
`You know, dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife.
There should be no secret, no concealment.  I have had a great shock,
and when I try to think of what it is I feel my head spin round,
and I do not know if it was real of the dreaming of a madman.
You know I had brain fever, and that is to be mad.
The secret is here, and I do not want to know it.
I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.'  For, my dear,
we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are complete.
`Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance?
Here is the book.  Take it and keep it, read it if you will,
but never let me know unless, indeed, some solemn duty should
come upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake,
sane or mad, recorded here.'  He fell back exhausted,
and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him.
have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding
be this afternoon, and am waiting her reply.  . .""


""She has come and told me that the Chaplain of the English mission
church has been sent for.  We are to be married in an hour,
or as soon after as Jonathan awakes.""


""Lucy, the time has come and gone.  I feel very solemn,
but very, very happy.  Jonathan woke a little after the hour,
and all was ready, and he sat up in bed, propped up with pillows.
He answered his `I will' firmly and strong.  I could hardly speak.
My heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me.

""The dear sisters were so kind.  Please, God, I shall never,
never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities I
have taken upon me.  I must tell you of my wedding present.
When the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--
oh, Lucy, it is the first time I have written the words `my husband'--
left me alone with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow,
and wrapped it up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit
of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck, and sealed it over
the knot with sealing wax, and for my seal I used my wedding ring.
Then I kissed it and showed it to my husband, and told him
that I would keep it so, and then it would be an outward and
visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each other,
that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake
or for the sake of some stern duty.  Then he took my hand in his,
and oh, Lucy, it was the first time he took his wifes' hand, and said
that it was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that
he would go through all the past again to win it, if need be.
The poor dear meant to have said a part of the past, but he cannot
think of time yet, and I shall not wonder if at first he mixes up
not only the month, but the year.

""Well, my dear, could I say?  I could only tell him that I was
the happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing
to give him except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these
went my love and duty for all the days of my life.  And, my dear,
when he kissed me, and drew me to him with his poor weak hands,
it was like a solemn pledge between us.


""Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this?  It is not only because it
is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to me.
It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from
the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life.  I want you to see now,
and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me,
so that in your own married life you too may be all happy, as I am.
My dear, please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises, a long
day of sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust.
I must not wish you no pain, for that can never be, but I do hope
you will be always as happy as I am now.  Goodbye, my dear.
I shall post this at once, and perhaps, write you very soon again.
I must stop, for Jonathan is waking.  I must attend my husband!

""Your ever-loving ""Mina Harker.""

LETTER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA HARKER.

Whitby, 30 August.

""My dearest Mina,

""Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be
in your own home with your husband.  I wish you were coming home
soon enough to stay with us here.  The strong air would soon
restore Jonathan.  It has quite restored me.  I have an appetite
like a cormorant, am full of life, and sleep well.  You will be
glad to know that I have quite given up walking in my sleep.
I think I have not stirred out of my bed for a week, that is
when I once got into it at night.  Arthur says I am getting fat.
By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here.
We have such walks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis,
and fishing together, and I love him more than ever.
He tells me that he loves me more, but I doubt that, for at first
he told me that he couldn't love me more than he did then.
But this is nonsense.  There he is, calling to me.
So no more just at present from your loving,

""Lucy.


""P.S.--Mother sends her love.  She seems better, poor dear.

""P.P.S.--We are to be married on 28 September.""

DR.  SEWARDS DIARY


20 August.--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting.
He has now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation
from his passion.  For the first week after his attack he was
perpetually violent.  Then one night, just as the moon rose,
he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to himself.  ""Now I can wait.
Now I can wait.""

The attendant came to tell me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him.
He was still in the strait waistcoat and in the padded room,
but the suffused look had gone from his face, and his eyes had something
of their old pleading.  I might almost say, cringing, softness.  I was
satisfied with his present condition, and directed him to be relieved.
The attendants hesitated, but finally carried out my wishes without protest.

It was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see
their distrust, for, coming close to me, he said in a whisper,
all the while looking furtively at them, ""They think I could hurt you!
Fancy me hurting you!  The fools!""

It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself
disassociated even in the mind of this poor madman from
the others, but all the same I do not follow his thought.
Am I to take it that I have anything in common with him, so that
we are, as it were, to stand together.  Or has he to gain from me
some good so stupendous that my well being is needful to Him?
I must find out later on.  Tonight he will not speak.
Even the offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will
not tempt him.

He will only say, ""I don't take any stock in cats.
I have more to think of now, and I can wait.  I can wait.""

After a while I left him.  The attendant tells me that he was quiet until
just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at length violent,
until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted him so that he swooned
into a sort of coma.


. . . Three nights has the same thing happened, violent all day then quiet
from moonrise to sunrise.  I wish I could get some clue to the cause.
It would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.
Happy thought!  We shall tonight play sane wits against mad ones.
He escaped before without our help.  Tonight he shall escape with it.
We shall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case
they are required.


23 August.--""The expected always happens.""  How well Disraeli knew life.
Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all our
subtle arrangements were for nought.  At any rate, we have proved
one thing, that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time.
We shall in future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day.
I have given orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in
the padded room, when once he is quiet, until the hour before sunrise.
The poor soul's body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot
appreciate it.  Hark!  The unexpected again!  I am called.
The patient has once more escaped.


Later.--Another night adventure.  Renfield artfully waited
until the attendant was entering the room to inspect.
Then he dashed out past him and flew down the passage.
I sent word for the attendants to follow.  Again he went
into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him
in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door.
When he saw me he became furious, and had not the attendants
seized him in time, he would have tried to kill me.
As we sere holding him a strange thing happened.
He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew calm.
I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing.
Then I caught the patient's eye and followed it, but could trace
nothing as it looked into the moonlight sky, except a big bat,
which was flapping its silent and ghostly way to the west.
Bats usually wheel about, but this one seemed to go straight on,
as if it knew where it was bound for or had some intention
of its own.

The patient grew calmer every instant, and presently said,
""You needn't tie me.  I shall go quietly!""  Without trouble,
we came back to the house.  I feel there is something ominous
in his calm, and shall not forget this night.



LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY


Hillingham, 24 August.--I must imitate Mina, and keep writing things down.
Then we can have long talks when we do meet.  I wonder when it
will be.  I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy.
Last night I seemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby.
Perhaps it is the change of air, or getting home again.
It is all dark and horrid to me, for I can remember nothing.
But I am full of vague fear, and I feel so weak and worn out.
When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved when he saw me,
and I hadn't the spirit to try to be cheerful.  I wonder if I could
sleep in mother's room tonight.  I shall make an excuse to try.


25 August.--Another bad night.  Mother did not seem to take to my proposal.
She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to worry me.
I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while, but when the clock struck
twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling asleep.
There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I did not
mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must have fallen asleep.
More bad dreams.  I wish I could remember them.  This morning I am
horribly weak.  My face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains me.
It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don't seem to be getting
air enough.  I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else I know
he will be miserable to see me so.



LETTER, ARTHUR TO DR.  SEWARD

""Albemarle Hotel, 31 August ""My dear Jack,

""I want you to do me a favour.  Lucy is ill, that is she has
no special disease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse
every day.  I have asked her if there is any cause, I not dare
to ask her mother, for to disturb the poor lady's mind about
her daughter in her present state of health would be fatal.
Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom is spoken,
disease of the heart, though poor Lucy does not know it yet.
I am sure that there is something preying on my dear girl's mind.
I am almost distracted when I think of her.  To look at her gives
me a pang.  I told her I should ask you to see her, and though she
demurred at first, I know why, old fellow, she finally consented.
It will be a painful task for you, I know, old friend, but it
is for her sake, and I must not hesitate to ask, or you to act.
You are to come to lunch at Hillingham tomorrow, two o'clock,
so as not to arouse any suspicion in Mrs. Westenra, and after
lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being alone with you.
I am filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone
as soon as I can after you have seen her.  Do not fail!

LETTER FROM DR.  SEWARD TO ARTHUR HOLMWOOD


2 September

""My dear old fellow,

""With regard to Miss Westenra's health I hasten to let you
know at once that in my opinion there is not any functal
disturbance or any malady that I know of.  At the same time,
I am not by any means satisfied with her appearance.
She is woefully different from what she was when I saw her last.
Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full opportunity
of examination such as I should wish.  Our very friendship makes
a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom
can bridge over.  I had better tell you exactly what happened,
leaving you to draw, in a measure, your own conclusions.
I shall then say what I have done and propose doing.

""I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits.  Her mother was present,
and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she
knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious.
I have no doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need
of caution there is.

""We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we got,
as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness amongst us.
Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with me.
We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,
for the servants were coming and going.

""As soon as the door was closed, however, the mask fell from her face, and she
sank down into a chair with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand.
When I saw that her high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her
reaction to make a diagnosis.

""She said to me very sweetly, `I cannot tell you how I loathe
talking about myself.'  I reminded her that a doctor's confidence
was sacred, but that you were grievously anxious about her.
She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that matter in a word.
`Tell Arthur everything you choose.  I do not care for myself,
but for him!'  So I am quite free.

""I could easily see that she was somewhat bloodless, but I could not
see the usual anemic signs, and by the chance , I was able to test
the actual quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff
a cord gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass.
It was a slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance,
and I secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them.

""The qualitative analysis give a quite normal condition,
and shows, I should infer, in itself a vigorous state of health.
In other physical matters I was quite satisfied that there
is no need for anxiety, but as there must be a cause somewhere,
I have come to the conclusion that it must be something mental.

""She complains of difficulty breathing satisfactorily at times, and of heavy,
lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but regarding which she can
remember nothing.  She says that as a child, she used to walk in her sleep,
and that when in Whitby the habit came back, and that once she walked
out in the night and went to East Cliff, where Miss Murray found her.
But she assures me that of late the habit has not returned.

""I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of.
I have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing,
of Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one
in the world.  I have asked him to come over, and as you told
me that all things were to be at your charge, I have mentioned
to him who you are and your relations to Miss Westenra.
This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to your wishes, for I
am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for her.

""Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal reason,
so no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his wishes.
He is a seemingly arbitrary man, this is because he knows what he is talking
about better than any one else.  He is a philosopher and a metaphysician,
and one of the most advanced scientists of his day, and he has, I believe,
an absolutely open mind.  This, with an iron nerve, a temper of the ice-brook,
and indomitable resolution, self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues
to blessings, and the kindliest and truest heart that beats, these form his
equipment for the noble work that he is doing for mankind, work both in theory
and practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy.
I tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in him.
I have asked him to come at once.  I shall see Miss Westenra tomorrow again.
She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not alarm her mother by too
early a repetition of my call.

""Yours always.""

""My good Friend,

""When I received your letter I am already coming to you.  By good fortune I
can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who have trusted me.
Were fortune other, then it were bad for those who have trusted,
for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holds dear.
Tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound so swiftly
the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other friend,
too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he wants my aids and you
call for them than all his great fortune could do.  But it is pleasure added
to do for him, your friend, it is to you that I come.  Have near at hand,
and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too late
on tomorrow, for it is likely that I may have to return here that night.
But if need be I shall come again in three days, and stay longer if it must.
Till then goodbye, my friend John.

""Van Helsing.""

LETTER, DR.  SEWARD TO HON.  ARTHUR HOLMWOOD


3 September

""My dear Art,

""Van Helsing has come and gone.  He came on with me to Hillingham,
and found that, by Lucy's discretion, her mother was lunching out,
so that we were alone with her.

""Van Helsing made a very careful examination of the patient.
He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of course I was
not present all the time.  He is, I fear, much concerned, but says
he must think.  When I told him of our friendship and how you trust
to me in the matter, he said, `You must tell him all you think.
Tell him him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will.  Nay, I am
not jesting.  This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.'
I asked what he meant by that, for he was very serious.
This was when we had come back to town, and he was having a cup of tea
before starting on his return to Amsterdam.  He would not give me
any further clue.  You must not be angry with me, Art, because his
very reticence means that all his brains are working for her good.
He will speak plainly enough when the time comes, be sure.
So I told him I would simply write an account of our visit, just as if I
were doing a descriptive special article for THE DAILY TELEGRAPH.
He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the smuts of London were
not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a student here.
I am to get his report tomorrow if he can possibly make it.
In any case I am to have a letter.

""Well, as to the visit, Lucy was more cheerful than on
the day I first saw her, and certainly looked better.
She had lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you,
and her breathing was normal.  She was very sweet to the Professor
(as she always is), and tried to make him feel at ease, though I
could see the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it.

""I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick look under his
bushy brows that I knew of old.  Then he began to chat of all things
except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite geniality
that I could see poor Lucy's pretense of animation merge into reality.
Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation gently
round to his visit, and sauvely said,

""`My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are
so much beloved.  That is much, my dear, even were there that which I
do not see.  They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were
of a ghastly pale.  To them I say ""Pouf!"" ' And he snapped his fingers
at me and went on.  `But you and I shall show them how wrong they are.
How can he', and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture
as that with which he pointed me out in his class, on, or rather after,
a particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of,
`know anything of a young ladies?  He has his madmen to play with,
and to bring them back to happiness, and to those that love them.
It is much to do, and, oh, but there are rewards in that we can bestow
such happiness.  But the young ladies!  He has no wife nor daughter,
and the young do not tell themselves to the young, but to the old,
like me, who have known so many sorrows and the causes of them.
So, my dear, we will send him away to smoke the cigarette in
the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all to ourselves.'
I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the professor
came to the window and called me in.  He looked grave, but said,
` I have made careful examination, but there is no functional cause.
With you I agree that there has been much blood lost, it has been
but is not.  But the conditions of her are in no way anemic.
I have asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one
or two questions, that so I may not chance to miss nothing.
I know well what she will say.  And yet there is cause.
There is always cause for everything.  I must go back home and think.
You must send me the telegram every day, and if there be cause I
shall come again.  The disease, for not to be well is a disease,
interest me, and the sweet, young dear, she interest me too.
She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.'

""As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.
And so now, Art, you know all I know.  I shall keep stern watch.
I trust your poor father is rallying.  It must be a terrible
thing to you, my dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position
between two people who are both so dear to you.  I know your
idea of duty to your father, and you are right to stick to it.
But if need be, I shall send you word to come at once to Lucy,
so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from me.""


DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


4 September.--Zoophagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.
He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time.
Just before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless.
The attendant knew the symptoms, and at once summoned aid.
Fortunately the men came at a run, and were just in time, for at the stroke
of noon he became so violent that it took all their strength to hold him.
In about five minutes, however, he began to get more quiet,
and finally sank into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has
remained up to now.  The attendant tells me that his screams whilst
in the paroxysm were really appalling.  I found my hands full
when I got in, attending to some of the other patients who were
frightened by him.  Indeed, I can quite understand the effect,
for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was some distance away.
It is now after the dinner hour of the asylum, and as yet my patient sits
in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen, woe-begone look in his face,
which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly.
I cannot quite understand it.


Later.--Another change in my patient.  At five o'clock I looked in on him,
and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be.
He was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture
by making nailmarks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding.
When he saw me, he came over and apologized for his bad conduct,
and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to his own room,
and to have his notebook again.  I thought it well to humour him,
so he is back in his room with the window open.  He has the sugar of his tea
spread out on the window sill, and is reaping quite a harvest of flies.
He is not now eating them, but putting them into a box, as of old,
and is already examining the corners of his room to find a spider.
I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any clue
to his thoughts would be of immense help to me, but he would not rise.
For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of far away voice,
as though saying it rather to himself than to me.

""All over!  All over!  He has deserted me.  No hope for me now unless I
do it myself!""  Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said,
""Doctor, won't you be very good to me and let me have a little more sugar?
I think it would be very good for me.""

""And the flies?""  I said.

""Yes!  The flies like it, too, and I like the flies, therefore I like it.""And
there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do not argue.
I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man as, I suppose,
any in the world.  I wish I could fathom his mind.


Midnight.--Another change in him.  I had been to see Miss Westenra,
whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our
own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling.
As his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better
than in the morning.  It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful
smoky beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights
and inky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on foul
clouds even as on foul water, and to realize all the grim sternness
of my own cold stone building, with its wealth of breathing misery,
and my own desolate heart to endure it all.  I reached him just as
the sun was going down, and from his window saw the red disc sink.
As it sank he became less and less frenzied, and just as it dipped
he slid from the hands that held him, an inert mass, on the floor.
It is wonderful, however, what intellectual recuperative power
lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up quite
calmly and looked around him.  I signalled to the attendants
not to hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do.
He went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar.
Then he took his fly box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box.
Then he shut the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed.
All this surprised me, so I asked him, ""Are you going to keep
flies any more?""

""No,"" said he.  ""I am sick of all that rubbish!""
He certainly is a wonderfully interesting study.
I wish I could get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause of his
sudden passion.  Stop.  There may be a clue after all, if we can
find why today his paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset.
Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at periods
which affects certain natures, as at times the moon does others?
We shall see.

LETTER, DR.  SEWARD TO HON.  ARTHUR HOLMWOOD


6 September

""My dear Art,

""My news today is not so good.  Lucy this morning had gone back a bit.
There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it.
Mrs. Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted
me professionally about her.  I took advantage of the opportunity,
and told her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist,
was coming to stay with me, and that I would put her in his charge
conjointly with myself.  So now we can come and go without
alarming her unduly, for a shock to her would mean sudden death,
and this, in Lucy's weak condition, might be disastrous to her.
We are hedged in with difficulties, all of us, my poor fellow,
but, please God, we shall come through them all right.
If any need I shall write, so that, if you do not hear from me,
take it for granted that I am simply waiting for news, In haste,

""Yours ever,""

John Seward



DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


7 September.--The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met
at Liverpool Street was, ""Have you said anything to our young friend,
to lover of her?""

""No,"" I said.  ""I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram.
I wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss
Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.""

""Right, my friend,"" he said.  ""Quite right!  Better he not know as yet.
Perhaps he will never know.  I pray so, but if it be needed,
then he shall know all.  And, my good friend John, let me caution you.
You deal with the madmen.  All men are mad in some way or
the other, and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen,
so deal with God's madmen too, the rest of the world.
You tell not your madmen what you do nor why you do it.  You tell
them not what you think.  So you shall keep knowledge in its place,
where it may rest, where it may gather its kind around it and breed.
You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here.""
He touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched
himself the same way.  ""I have for myself thoughts at the present.
Later I shall unfold to you.""

""Why not now?""  I asked.  ""It may do some good.
We may arrive at some decision.""He looked at me and said,
""My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it
has ripened, while the milk of its mother earth is in him,
and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold,
the husbandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands,
and blow away the green chaff, and say to you, 'Look!
He's good corn, he will make a good crop when the time comes.'
""

I did not see the application and told him so.  For reply he reached
over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully,
as he used long ago to do at lectures, and said, ""The good
husbandman tell you so then because he knows, but not till then.
But you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn
to see if he grow.  That is for the children who play at husbandry,
and not for those who take it as of the work of their life.
See you now, friend John?  I have sown my corn, and Nature
has her work to do in making it sprout, if he sprout at all,
there's some promise, and I wait till the ear begins to swell.""
He broke off, for he evidently saw that I understood.
Then he went on gravely, ""You were always a careful student,
and your case book was ever more full than the rest.
And I trust that good habit have not fail.  Remember, my friend,
that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust
the weaker.  Even if you have not kept the good practice,
let me tell you that this case of our dear miss is one that may be,
mind, I say may be, of such interest to us and others that all
the rest may not make him kick the beam, as your people say.
Take then good note of it.  Nothing is too small.
I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.
Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess.
We learn from failure, not from success!""

When I described Lucy's symptoms, the same as before,
but infinitely more marked, he looked very grave, but said nothing.
He took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs,
""the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade,""
as he once called, in one of his lectures, the equipment
of a professor of the healing craft.

When we were shown in, Mrs. Westenra met us.  She was alarmed,
but not nearly so much as I expected to find her.  Nature in one
of her beneficient moods has ordained that even death has some
antidote to its own terrors.  Here, in a case where any shock
may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some cause
or other, the things not personal, even the terrible change in her
daughter to whom she is so attached, do not seem to reach her.
It is something like the way dame Nature gathers round a foreign
body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect
from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact.
If this be an ordered selfishness, then we should pause
before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism, for there
may be deeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of.

I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology,
and set down a rule that she should not be present with Lucy,
or think of her illness more than was absolutely required.
She assented readily, so readily that I saw again the hand
of Nature fighting for life.  Van Helsing and I were shown up
to Lucy's room.  If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday,
I was horrified when I saw her today.

She was ghastly, chalkily pale.  The red seemed to have gone even from
her lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently.
Her breathing was painful to see or hear.  Van Helsing's face grew set
as marble, and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose.
Lucy lay motionless, and did not seem to have strength to speak,
so for a while we were all silent.  Then Van Helsing beckoned to me,
and we went gently out of the room.  The instant we had closed the door
he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door, which was open.
Then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door.
""My god!"" he said.  ""This is dreadful.  There is not time to be lost.
She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart's action
as it should be.  There must be a transfusion of blood at once.
Is it you or me?""

""I am younger and stronger, Professor.  It must be me.""

""Then get ready at once.  I will bring up my bag.
I am prepared.""

I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was
a knock at the hall door.  When we reached the hall, the maid
had just opened the door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in.
He rushed up to me, saying in an eager whisper,

""Jack, I was so anxious.  I read between the lines of your letter,
and have been in an agony.  The dad was better, so I ran down
here to see for myself.  Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing?
I am so thankful to you, sir, for coming.""

When first the Professor's eye had lit upon him, he had been
angry at his interruption at such a time, but now, as he took
in his stalwart proportions and recognized the strong young
manhood which seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed.
Without a pause he said to him as he held out his hand,

""Sir, you have come in time.  You are the lover of our dear miss.
She is bad, very, very bad.  Nay, my child, do not go like that.""For
he suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting.
""You are to help her.  You can do more than any that live,
and your courage is your best help.""

""What can I do?"" asked Arthur hoarsely.  ""Tell me, and I shall do it.
My life is hers' and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for her.""

The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old
knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer.

""My young sir, I do not ask so much as that, not the last!""

""What shall I do?""  There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostrils
quivered with intent.  Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder.

""Come!"" he said.  ""You are a man, and it is a man we want.
You are better than me, better than my friend John.""
Arthur looked bewildered, and the Professor went on by explaining
in a kindly way.

""Young miss is bad, very bad.  She wants blood, and blood she
must have or die.  My friend John and I have consulted, and we
are about to perform what we call transfusion of blood, to transfer
from full veins of one to the empty veins which pine for him.
John was to give his blood, as he is the more young and strong
than me.""--Here Arthur took my hand and wrung it hard in
silence.--""But now you are here, you are more good than us,
old or young, who toil much in the world of thought.
Our nerves are not so calm and our blood so bright than yours!""

Arthur turned to him and said, ""If you only knew how gladly
I would die for her you would understand.  . ."" He stopped
with a sort of choke in his voice.

""Good boy!"" said Van Helsing.  ""In the not-so-far-off you
will be happy that you have done all for her you love.
Come now and be silent.  You shall kiss her once before it
is done, but then you must go, and you must leave at my sign.
Say no word to Madame.  You know how it is with her.
There must be no shock, any knowledge of this would be one.  Come!""

We all went up to Lucy's room.  Arthur by direction remained outside.
Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing.
She was not asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort.
Her eyes spoke to us, that was all.

Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid them on a little
table out of sight.  Then he mixed a narcotic, and coming over to
the bed, said cheerily, ""Now, little miss, here is your medicine.
Drink it off, like a good child.  See, I lift you so that to swallow
is easy.  Yes.""  She had made the effort with success.

It astonished me how long the drug took to act.
This, in fact, marked the extent of her weakness.  The time
seemed endless until sleep began to flicker in her eyelids.
At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest its potency,
and she fell into a deep sleep.  When the Professor was satisfied,
he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his coat.
Then he added, ""You may take that one little kiss whiles
I bring over the table.  Friend John, help to me!""
So neither of us looked whilst he bent over her.

Van Helsing, turning to me, said, ""He is so young and strong,
and of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate it.""

Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed
the operation.  As the transfusion went on, something like life
seemed to come back to poor Lucy's cheeks, and through Arthur's
growing pallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine.
After a bit I began to grow anxious, for the loss of blood was telling
on Arthur, strong man as he was.  It gave me an idea of what a terrible
strain Lucy's system must have undergone that what weakened Arthur
only partially restored her.

But the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in hand,
and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur.
I could hear my own heart beat.  Presently, he said in a soft voice,
""Do not stir an instant.  It is enough.  You attend him.
I will look to her.""

When all was over, I could see how much Arthur was weakened.
I dressed the wound and took his arm to bring him away,
when Van Helsing spoke without turning round, the man seems
to have eyes in the back of his head, ""The brave lover,
I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have presently.""
And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the pillow
to the patient's head.  As he did so the narrow black velvet
band which she seems always to wear round her throat,
buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her,
was dragged a little up, and showed a red mark on her throat.

Arthur did not notice it, but I could hear the deep hiss of indrawn
breath which is one of Van Helsing's ways of betraying emotion.
He said nothing at the moment, but turned to me, saying, ""Now take down our
brave young lover, give him of the port wine, and let him lie down a while.
He must then go home and rest, sleep much and eat much, that he may be
recruited of what he has so given to his love.  He must not stay here.
Hold a moment!  I may take it, sir, that you are anxious of result.
Then bring it with you, that in all ways the operation is successful.
You have saved her life this time, and you can go home and rest easy
in mind that all that can be is.  I shall tell her all when she is well.
She shall love you none the less for what you have done.  Goodbye.""

When Arthur had gone I went back to the room.
Lucy was sleeping gently, but her breathing was stronger.
I could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved.
By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.
The velvet band again covered the red mark.  I asked the Professor
in a whisper, ""What do you make of that mark on her throat?""

""What do you make of it?""

""I have not examined it yet,"" I answered, and then and there
proceeded to loose the band.  Just over the external jugular vein
there were two punctures, not large, but not wholesome looking.
There was no sign of disease, but the edges were white and worn looking,
as if by some trituration.  It at once occurred to me that that this wound,
or whatever it was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood.
But I abandoned the idea as soon as it formed, for such a thing could not be.
The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood
which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had
before the transfusion.

""Well?"" said Van Helsing.

""Well,"" said I. ""I can make nothing of it.""

The Professor stood up.  ""I must go back to Amsterdam tonight,""
he said ""There are books and things there which I want.
You must remain here all night, and you must not let your sight
pass from her.""

""Shall I have a nurse?""  I asked.

""We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night.
See that she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her.
You must not sleep all the night.  Later on we can sleep,
you and I. I shall be back as soon as possible.
And then we may begin.""

""May begin?""  I said.  ""What on earth do you mean?""

""We shall see!"" he answered, as he hurried out.  He came back a moment later
and put his head inside the door and said with a warning finger held up,
""Remember, she is your charge.  If you leave her, and harm befall,
you shall not sleep easy hereafter!""


DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY--CONTINUED


8 September.--I sat up all night with Lucy.  The opiate worked
itself off towards dusk, and she waked naturally.  She looked
a different being from what she had been before the operation.
Her spirits even were good, and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I
could see evidences of the absolute prostration which she had undergone.
When I told Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had directed
that I should sit up with her, she almost pooh-poohed the idea,
pointing out her daughter's renewed strength and excellent spirits.
I was firm, however, and made preparations for my long vigil.
When her maid had prepared her for the night I came in, having in
the meantime had supper, and took a seat by the bedside.

She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me gratefully whenever
I caught her eye.  After a long spell she seemed sinking off to sleep,
but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook it off.
It was apparent that she did not want to sleep, so I tackled the
subject at once.

""You do not want to sleep?""

""No. I am afraid.""

""Afraid to go to sleep!  Why so?  It is the boon we all crave for.""

""Ah, not if you were like me, if sleep was to you a presage of horror!""

""A presage of horror!  What on earth do you mean?""

""I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  And that is what is so terrible.
All this weakness comes to me in sleep, until I dread the very thought.""

""But, my dear girl, you may sleep tonight.  I am here watching you,
and I can promise that nothing will happen.""

""Ah, I can trust you!"" she said.

I seized the opportunity, and said, ""I promise that if I see
any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.""

""You will?  Oh, will you really?  How good you are to me.
Then I will sleep!""  And almost at the word she gave a deep
sigh of relief, and sank back, asleep.

All night long I watched by her.  She never stirred, but slept
on and on in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep.
Her lips were slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell
with the regularity of a pendulum.  There was a smile on her face,
and it was evident that no bad dreams had come to disturb
her peace of mind.

In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took myself
back home, for I was anxious about many things.  I sent a short wire to Van
Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result of the operation.
My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all day to clear off.
It was dark when I was able to inquire about my zoophagous patient.
The report was good.  He had been quite quiet for the past day and night.
A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst I was at dinner,
suggesting that I should be at Hillingham tonight, as it might be well to be
at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the night mail and would join me
early in the morning.


9 September.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to Hillingham.
For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my brain was
beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion.
Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits.  When she shook hands with me
she looked sharply in my face and said,

""No sitting up tonight for you.  You are worn out.
I am quite well again.  Indeed, I am, and if there is to be
any sitting up, it is I who will sit up with you.""

I would not argue the point, but went and had my supper.
Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence,
I made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more
than excellent port.  Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed
me a room next her own, where a cozy fire was burning.

""Now,"" she said.  ""You must stay here.  I shall leave this door open and my
door too.  You can lie on the sofa for I know that nothing would induce any
of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon.
If I want anything I shall call out, and you can come to me at once.""

I could not but acquiesce, for I was dog tired, and could
not have sat up had I tried.  So, on her renewing her promise
to call me if she should want anything, I lay on the sofa,
and forgot all about everything.

LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY


9 September.--I feel so happy tonight.  I have been so miserably weak,
that to be able to think and move about is like feeling
sunshine after a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky.
Somehow Arthur feels very, very close to me.  I seem to feel
his presence warm about me.  I suppose it is that sickness
and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner eyes and
sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give love rein,
and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills.
I know where my thoughts are.  If only Arthur knew!
My dear, my dear, your ears must tingle as you sleep,
as mine do waking.  Oh, the blissful rest of last night!
How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me.
And tonight I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand
and within call.  Thank everybody for being so good to me.
Thank God!  Goodnight Arthur.

DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


10 September.--I was conscious of the Professor's hand on my head, and started
awake all in a second.  That is one of the things that we learn in an asylum,
at any rate.

""And how is our patient?""

""Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,"" I answered.

""Come, let us see,"" he said.  And together we went into the room.

The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently,
whilst Van Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread,
over to the bed.

As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded
the room, I heard the Professor's low hiss of inspiration,
and knowing its rarity, a deadly fear shot through my heart.
As I passed over he moved back, and his exclamation of horror,
""Gott in Himmel!"" needed no enforcement from his agonized face.
He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his iron face
was drawn and ashen white.  I felt my knees begin to tremble.

There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly
white and wan-looking than ever.  Even the lips were white,
and the gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth,
as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness.

Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger, but the instinct
of his life and all the long years of habit stood to him,
and he put it down again softly.

""Quick!"" he said.  ""Bring the brandy.""

I flew to the dining room, and returned with the decanter.
He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed
palm and wrist and heart.  He felt her heart, and after a few
moments of agonizing suspense said,

""It is not too late.  It beats, though but feebly.  All our work
is undone.  We must begin again.  There is no young Arthur here now.
I have to call on you yourself this time, friend John.""  As he spoke,
he was dipping into his bag, and producing the instruments of transfusion.
I had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt sleeve.  There was
no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one.
and so, without a moment's delay, we began the operation.

After a time, it did not seem a short time either, for the draining
away of one's blood, no matter how willingly it be given,
is a terrible feeling, Van Helsing held up a warning finger.
""Do not stir,"" he said.  ""But I fear that with growing strength
she may wake, and that would make danger, oh, so much danger.
But I shall precaution take.  I shall give hypodermic
injection of morphia.""  He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly,
to carry out his intent.

The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge subtly into
the narcotic sleep.  It was with a feeling of personal pride that I could
see a faint tinge of color steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips.
No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to feel his own lifeblood
drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.

The Professor watched me critically.  ""That will do,""
he said.  ""Already?""  I remonstrated.  ""You took a great deal
more from Art.""  To which he smiled a sad sort of smile
as he replied,

""He is her lover, her fiance.  You have work, much work to do for her
and for others, and the present will suffice.

When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy,
whilst I applied digital pressure to my own incision.
I laid down, while I waited his leisure to attend to me, for I
felt faint and a little sick.  By and by he bound up my wound,
and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself.
As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half whispered.

""Mind, nothing must be said of this.  If our young lover
should turn up unexpected, as before, no word to him.
It would at once frighten him and enjealous him, too.
There must be none.  So!""

When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said,
""You are not much the worse.  Go into the room, and lie on your sofa,
and rest awhile, then have much breakfast and come here to me.""

I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were.
I had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength.
I felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at
what had occurred.  I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over and
over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how she could
have been drained of so much blood with no sign any where to show for it.
I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for, sleeping and
waking my thoughts always came back to the little punctures in her throat
and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their edges, tiny though they were.

Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly
well and strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before.
When Van Helsing had seen her, he went out for a walk,
leaving me in charge, with strict injunctions that I was not
to leave her for a moment.  I could hear his voice in the hall,
asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.

Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that
anything had happened.  I tried to keep her amused and interested.
When her mother came up to see her, she did not seem to notice
any change whatever, but said to me gratefully,

""We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really must
now take care not to overwork yourself.  You are looking pale yourself.
You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit, that you do!""
As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily, for her
poor wasted veins could not stand for long an unwonted drain to the head.
The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned imploring eyes on me.
I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my lips.  With a sigh,
she sank back amid her pillows.

Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me.
""Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough.  Make yourself strong.
I stay here tonight, and I shall sit up with little miss myself.
You and I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know.
I have grave reasons.  No, do not ask the.  Think what you will.
Do not fear to think even the most not-improbable. Goodnight.""

In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they
or either of them might not sit up with Miss Lucy.
They implored me to let them, and when I said it was Dr. Van
Helsing's wish that either he or I should sit up, they asked
me quite piteously to intercede with the`foreign gentleman'. I
was much touched by their kindness.  Perhaps it is because I am
weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy's account,
that their devotion was manifested.  For over and over
again have I seen similar instances of woman's kindness.
I got back here in time for a late dinner, went my rounds,
all well, and set this down whilst waiting for sleep.
It is coming.


11 September.--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham.
Found Van Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better.
Shortly after I had arrived, a big parcel from abroad came
for the Professor.  He opened it with much impressment, assumed,
of course, and showed a great bundle of white flowers.

""These are for you, Miss Lucy,"" he said.

""For me?  Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!""

""Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with.  These are medicines.""
Here Lucy made a wry face.  ""Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction
or in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose,
or I shall point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to
endure in seeing so much beauty that he so loves so much distort.
Aha, my pretty miss, that bring the so nice nose all straight again.
This is medicinal, but you do not know how.  I put him in your window,
I make pretty wreath, and hang him round your neck, so you sleep well.
Oh, yes!  They, like the lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten.
It smell so like the waters of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth
that the Conquistadores sought for in the Floridas, and find him
all too late.""

Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and
smelling them.  Now she threw them down saying, with half laughter,
and half disgust,

""Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me.
Why, these flowers are only common garlic.""

To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness,
his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting,

""No trifling with me!  I never jest!  There is grim purpose
in what I do, and I warn you that you do not thwart me.
Take care, for the sake of others if not for your own.""
Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might well be, he went
on more gently, ""Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear me.
I only do for your good, but there is much virtue to you in those
so common flowers.  See, I place them myself in your room.
I make myself the wreath that you are to wear.  But hush!
No telling to others that make so inquisitive questions.
We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience, and obedience
is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait for you.
Now sit still a while.  Come with me, friend John, and you shall
help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the war
from Haarlem, where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his
glass houses all the year.  I had to telegraph yesterday,
or they would not have been here.""

We went into the room, taking the flowers with us.
The Professor's actions were certainly odd and not
to be found in any pharmacopeia that I ever heard of.
First he fastened up the windows and latched them securely.
Next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all
over the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air
that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell.
Then with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door,
above, below, and at each side, and round the fireplace
in the same way.  It all seemed grotesque to me,
and presently I said, ""Well, Professor, I know you always
have a reason for what you do, but this certainly puzzles me.
It is well we have no sceptic here, or he would say that you
were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.""

""Perhaps I am!""  He answered quietly as he began to make the wreath
which Lucy was to wear round her neck.

We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she
was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck.
The last words he said to her were,

""Take care you do not disturb it, and even if the room feel close,
do not tonight open the window or the door.""

""I promise,"" said Lucy.  ""And thank you both a thousand times for all your
kindness to me!  Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?""

As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said,
""Tonight I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want, two nights of travel,
much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,
and a night to sit up, without to wink.  Tomorrow in the morning
early you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss,
so much more strong for my `spell' which I have work.  Ho, ho!""

He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights
before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror.
It must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend,
but I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.





CHAPTER 11


LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY


12 September.--How good they all are to me.  I quite love that dear
Dr. Van Helsing.  I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers.
He positively frightened me, he was so fierce.  And yet he must
have been right, for I feel comfort from them already.  Somehow, I do
not dread being alone tonight, and I can go to sleep without fear.
I shall not mind any flapping outside the window.  Oh, the terrible
struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late, the pain
of sleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, and with such
unknown horrors as it has for me!  How blessed are some people,
whose lives have no fears, no dreads, to whom sleep is a blessing
that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams.  Well, here I
am tonight, hoping for sleep, and lying like Ophelia in the play,
with`virgin crants and maiden strewments.'  I never liked garlic before,
but tonight it is delightful!  There is peace in its smell.
I feel sleep coming already.  Goodnight, everybody.

DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


13 September.--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,
up to time.  The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting.
The Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.

Let all be put down exactly.  Van Helsing and I arrived
at Hillingham at eight o'clock. It was a lovely morning.
The bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early
autumn seemed like the completion of nature's annual work.
The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colors,
but had not yet begun to drop from the trees.  When we
entered we met Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room.
She is always an early riser.  She greeted us warmly and said,

""You will be glad to know that Lucy is better.  The dear child
is still asleep.  I looked into her room and saw her, but did
not go in, lest I should disturb her.""  The Professor smiled,
and looked quite jubilant.  He rubbed his hands together,
and said, ""Aha!  I thought I had diagnosed the case.
My treatment is working.""

To which she replied, ""You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor.
Lucy's state this morning is due in part to me.""

""How do you mean, ma'am?"" asked the Professor.

""Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went
into her room.  She was sleeping soundly, so soundly that even
my coming did not wake her.  But the room was awfully stuffy.
There were a lot of those horrible, strong-smelling flowers
about everywhere, and she had actually a bunch of them round
her neck.  I feared that the heavy odor would be too much
for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away
and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air.
You will be pleased with her, I am sure.""

She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early.  As she
had spoken, I watched the Professor's face, and saw it turn ashen gray.
He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady was present,
for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be.  He actually
smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room.
But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and forcibly,
into the dining room and closed the door.

Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down.
He raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair,
and then beat his palms together in a helpless way.
Finally he sat down on a chair, and putting his hands before
his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs that seemed to come
from the very racking of his heart.

Then he raised his arms again, as though appealing to the
whole universe.  ""God!  God!  God!"" he said.  ""What have we done,
what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset?
Is there fate amongst us still, send down from the pagan
world of old, that such things must be, and in such way?
This poor mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think,
does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul, and we
must not tell her, we must not even warn her, or she die,
then both die.  Oh, how we are beset!  How are all the powers
of the devils against us!""

Suddenly he jumped to his feet.  ""Come,"" he said.""come, we must see and act.
Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not.
We must fight him all the same.""  He went to the hall door for his bag,
and together we went up to Lucy's room.

Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.
This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same awful,
waxen pallor as before.  He wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity.

""As I expected,"" he murmured, with that hissing inspiration
of his which meant so much.  Without a word he went and locked
the door, and then began to set out on the little table the
instruments for yet another operation of transfusion of blood.
I had long ago recognized the necessity, and begun to take
off my coat, but he stopped me with a warning hand.
""No!"" he said.  ""Today you must operate.  I shall provide.
You are weakened already.""  As he spoke he took off his coat
and rolled up his shirtsleeve.

Again the operation.  Again the narcotic.  Again some return of color
to the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep.
This time I watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.

Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she
must not remove anything from Lucy's room without consulting him.
That the flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing
of their odor was a part of the system of cure.  Then he took
over the care of the case himself, saying that he would watch this
night and the next, and would send me word when to come.

After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and seemingly
not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.

What does it all mean?  I am beginning to wonder if my long habit
of life amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.

LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY


17 September.--Four days and nights of peace.  I am getting so strong
again that I hardly know myself.  It is as if I had passed through some
long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel
the fresh air of the morning around me.  I have a dim half remembrance
of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing, darkness in which there
was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant.
And then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to life as a diver
coming up through a great press of water.  Since, however, Dr. Van Helsing
has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away.
The noises that used to frighten me out of my wits, the flapping against
the windows, the distant voices which seemed so close to me, the harsh
sounds that came from I know not where and commanded me to do I know
not what, have all ceased.  I go to bed now without any fear of sleep.
I do not even try to keep awake.  I have grown quite fond of the garlic,
and a boxful arrives for me every day from Haarlem.  Tonight Dr. Van
Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a day in Amsterdam.
But I need not be watched.  I am well enough to be left alone.

Thank God for Mother's sake, and dear Arthur's, and for all our
friends who have been so kind!  I shall not even feel the change,
for last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time.
I found him asleep twice when I awoke.  But I did not fear to go
to sleep again, although the boughs or bats or something flapped
almost angrily against the window panes.




THE PALL MALL GAZETTE 18 September.

THE ESCAPED WOLF PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER

INTERVIEW WITH THE KEEPER IN THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS


After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually
using the words `PALL MALL GAZETTE ' as a sort of talisman,
I managed to find the keeper of the section of the Zoological Gardens
in which the wold department is included.  Thomas Bilder lives
in one of the cottages in the enclosure behind the elephant house,
and was just sitting down to his tea when I found him.
Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk, elderly, and without
children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their hospitality
be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty comfortable.
The keeper would not enter on what he called business
until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied.
Then when the table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said,

""Now, Sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want.  You'll excoose
me refoosin' to talk of perfeshunal subjucts afore meals.
I gives the wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section
their tea afore I begins to arsk them questions.""

""How do you mean, ask them questions?""  I queried, wishful to get
him into a talkative humor.

"" `Ittin' of them over the `ead with a pole is one way.
Scratchin' of their ears in another, when gents as is flush
wants a bit of a show-orf to their gals.  I don't so much
mind the fust, the `ittin of the pole part afore I chucks
in their dinner, but I waits till they've `ad their sherry
and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the ear
scratchin'. Mind you,"" he added philosophically, ""there's a
deal of the same nature in us as in them theer animiles.
Here's you a-comin' and arskin' of me questions about
my business, and I that grump-like that only for your bloomin'
`arf-quid I'd `a' seen you blowed fust `fore I'd answer.
Not even when you arsked me sarcastic like if I'd like you
to arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions.
Without offence did I tell yer to go to `ell?""

""You did.""

""An' when you said you'd report me for usin' obscene language that was `ittin'
me over the `ead. But the `arf-quid made that all right.  I weren't a-goin'
to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my `owl as the wolves
and lions and tigers does.  But, lor' love yer `art, now that the old `ooman
has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an' rinsed me out with her bloomin'
old teapot, and I've lit hup, you may scratch my ears for all you're worth,
and won't even get a growl out of me.  Drive along with your questions.
I know what yer a-comin' at, that `ere escaped wolf.""

""Exactly.  I want you to give me your view of it.
Just tell me how it happened, and when I know the facts
I'll get you to say what you consider was the cause of it,
and how you think the whole affair will end.""

""All right, guv'nor. This `ere is about the `ole story.
That`ere wolf what we called Bersicker was one of three gray ones that
came from Norway to Jamrach's, which we bought off him four years ago.
He was a nice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of.
I'm more surprised at `im for wantin' to get out nor any other animile
in the place.  But, there, you can't trust wolves no more nor women.""

""Don't you mind him, Sir!"" broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh.
"" `E's got mindin' the animiles so long that blest if he ain't
like a old wolf `isself! But there ain't no `arm in `im.""

""Well, Sir, it was about two hours after feedin'
yesterday when I first hear my disturbance.  I was makin'
up a litter in the monkey house for a young puma which is ill.
But when I heard the yelpin' and `owlin' I kem away straight.
There was Bersicker a-tearin' like a mad thing at the bars as if
he wanted to get out.  There wasn't much people about that day,
and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a `ook
nose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin' through it.
He had a `ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike
to him, for it seemed as if it was `im as they was hirritated at.
He `ad white kid gloves on `is `ands, and he pointed out the animiles
to me and says, `Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.'

""`Maybe it's you,' says I, for I did not like the airs as he give
`isself. He didn't get angry, as I `oped he would, but he smiled
a kind of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth.
`Oh no, they wouldn't like me,' `e says.

"" `Ow yes, they would,' says I, a-imitatin'of him.`They always
like a bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea time,
which you `as a bagful.'

""Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin'
they lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me
stroke his ears same as ever.  That there man kem over,
and blessed but if he didn't put in his hand and stroke the old
wolf's ears too!

"" `Tyke care,' says I. `Bersicker is quick.'

"" `Never mind,' he says.  I'm used to `em!'

"" `Are you in the business yourself?""  I says, tyking off my `at, for a man
what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.

"" `Nom' says he, `not exactly in the business, but I `ave made
pets of several.'  and with that he lifts his `at as perlite
as a lord, and walks away.  Old Bersicker kep' a-lookin'
arter `im till `e was out of sight, and then went and lay
down in a corner and wouldn't come hout the `ole hevening.
Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves here
all began a-`owling. There warn't nothing for them to `owl at.
There warn't no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin'
a dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road.
Once or twice I went out to see that all was right, and it was,
and then the `owling stopped.  Just before twelve o'clock
I just took a look round afore turnin' in, an', bust me,
but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker's cage I see
the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty.
And that's all I know for certing.""

""Did any one else see anything?""

""One of our gard`ners was a-comin' `ome about that time from a `armony,
when he sees a big gray dog comin' out through the garding `edges. At least,
so he says, but I don't give much for it myself, for if he did `e never
said a word about it to his missis when `e got `ome, and it was only after
the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all night a-huntin'
of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein' anything.  My own belief
was that the `armony `ad got into his `ead.""

""Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the wolf?""

""Well, Sir,"" he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, ""I think I can,
but I don't know as `ow you'd be satisfied with the theory.""

""Certainly I shall.  If a man like you, who knows the animals from experience,
can't hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?""

""well then, Sir, I accounts for it this way.  It seems to me that `ere
wolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out.""

From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed
at the joke I could see that it had done service before,
and that the whole explanation was simply an elaborate sell.
I couldn't cope in badinage with the worthy Thomas, but I thought
I knew a surer way to his heart, so I said, ""Now, Mr. Bilder,
we'll consider that first half-sovereign worked off, and this
brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you've told me
what you think will happen.""

""Right y`are, Sir,"" he said briskly.  ""Ye`ll excoose me, I know,
for a-chaffin' of ye, but the old woman her winked at me,
which was as much as telling me to go on.""

""Well, I never!"" said the old lady.

""My opinion is this.  That `ere wolf is a`idin' of, somewheres.
The gard`ner wot didn't remember said he was a-gallopin'
northward faster than a horse could go, but I don't believe him,
for, yer see, Sir, wolves don't gallop no more nor dogs does,
they not bein' built that way.  Wolves is fine things in
a storybook, and I dessay when they gets in packs and does
be chivyin' somethin' that's more afeared than they is they
can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is.
But, Lor' bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature,
not half so clever or bold as a good dog, and not half a quarter
so much fight in `im. This one ain't been used to fightin'
or even to providin' for hisself, and more like he's somewhere
round the Park a'hidin' an' a'shiverin' of, and if he thinks
at all, wonderin' where he is to get his breakfast from.
Or maybe he's got down some area and is in a coal cellar.
My eye, won't some cook get a rum start when she sees
his green eyes a-shinin' at her out of the dark!
If he can't get food he's bound to look for it, and mayhap
he may chance to light on a butcher's shop in time.
If he doesn't, and some nursemaid goes out walkin' or orf
with a soldier, leavin' of the hinfant in the perambulator--
well, then I shouldn't be surprised if the census is one babby
the less.  That's all.""

I was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing
up against the window, and Mr. Bilder's face doubled its natural
length with surprise.

""God bless me!"" he said.  ""If there ain't old Bersicker come
back by `isself!""

He went to the door and opened it, a most unnecessary proceeding it
seemed to me.  I have always thought that a wild animal never looks
so well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us.
A personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.

After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder
nor his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog.
The animal itself was a peaceful and well-behaved as that father
of all picture-wolves, Red Riding Hood's quondam friend, whilst moving
her confidence in masquerade.

The whole scene was a unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos.
The wicked wolf that for a half a day had paralyzed London
and set all the children in town shivering in their shoes,
was there in a sort of penitent mood, and was received
and petted like a sort of vulpine prodigal son.
Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender solicitude,
and when he had finished with his penitent said,

""There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble.
Didn't I say it all along?  Here's his head all cut and full of broken glass.
`E's been a-gettin' over some bloomin' wall or other.  It's a shyme
that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.
This `ere's what comes of it.  Come along, Bersicker.""

He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat
that satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions
of the fatted calf, and went off to report.

I came off too, to report the only exclusive information that is given
today regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.



DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


17 September.--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up
my books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,
had fallen sadly into arrear.  Suddenly the door was burst open,
and in rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion.
I was thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his
own accord into the Superintendent's study is almost unknown.

Without an instant's notice he made straight at me.
He had a dinner knife in his hand, and as I saw he was dangerous,
I tried to keep the table between us.  He was too quick and
too strong for me, however, for before I could get my balance
he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.

Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right
hand and he was sprawling on his back on the floor.
My wrist bled freely, and quite a little pool trickled
on to the carpet.  I saw that my friend was not intent
on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,
keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time.
When the attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention
to him, his employment positively sickened me.  He was lying
on his belly on the floor licking up, like a dog, the blood
which had fallen from my wounded wrist.  He was easily secured,
and to my surprise, went with the attendants quite placidly,
simply repeating over and over again, ""The blood is the life!
The blood is the life!""

I cannot afford to lose blood just at present.  I have lost too
much of late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain
of Lucy's illness and its horrible phases is telling on me.
I am over excited and weary, and I need rest, rest, rest.
Happily Van Helsing has not summoned me, so I need not forego my sleep.
Tonight I could not well do without it.



TELEGRAM, VAN HELSING, ANTWERP, TO SEWARD, CARFAX

(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given, delivered late
by twenty-two hours.)

17 September.--Do not fail to be at Hilllingham tonight.
If not watching all the time, frequently visit and see
that flowers are as placed, very important, do not fail.
Shall be with you as soon as possible after arrival.



DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


18 September.--Just off train to London.  The arrival of Van
Helsing's telegram filled me with dismay.  A whole night lost,
and I know by bitter experience what may happen in a night.
Of course it is possible that all may be well, but what may
have happened?  Surely there is some horrible doom hanging over us
that every possible accident should thwart us in all we try to do.
I shall take this cylinder with me, and then I can complete
my entry on Lucy's phonograph.




MEMORANDUM LEFT BY LUCY WESTENRA

17 September, Night.--I write this and leave it to be seen,
so that no one may by any chance get into trouble through me.
This is an exact record of what took place tonight.
I feel I am dying of weakness, and have barely strength to write,
but it must be done if I die in the doing.

I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr. Van
Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.

I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun
after that sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina
saved me, and which now I know so well.  I was not afraid,
but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in the next room, as Dr. Van
Helsing said he would be, so that I might have called him.
I tried to sleep, but I could not.  Then there came to me
the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake.
Perversely sleep would try to come then when I did not want it.
So, as I feared to be alone, I opened my door and called out.
""Is there anybody there?""  There was no answer.
I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.
Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like
a dog's, but more fierce and deeper.  I went to the window
and looked out, but could see nothing, except a big bat,
which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the window.
So I went back to bed again, but determined not to go to sleep.
Presently the door opened, and mother looked in.  Seeing by my
moving that I was not asleep, she came in and sat by me.
She said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont,

""I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you
were all right.""

I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come
in and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me.
She did not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay
a while and then go back to her own bed.  As she lay there in my arms,
and I in hers the flapping and buffeting came to the window again.
She was startled and a little frightened, and cried out, ""What is that?""

I tried to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet.
But I could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly.
After a while there was the howl again out in the shrubbery,
and shortly after there was a crash at the window,
and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.
The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in,
and in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head
of a great, gaunt gray wolf.

Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting
posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her.
Amongst other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van
Helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away
from me.  For a second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf,
and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat.
Then she fell over, as if struck with lightning, and her head hit
my forehead and made me dizzy for a moment or two.

The room and all round seemed to spin round.  I kept my eyes fixed
on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole myriad
of little specks seems to come blowing in through the broken window,
and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers
describe when there is a simoon in the desert.  I tried to stir,
but there was some spell upon me, and dear Mother's poor body,
which seemed to grow cold already, for her dear heart had ceased
to beat, weighed me down, and I remembered no more for a while.

The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered
consciousness again.  Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling.
The dogs all round the neighborhood were howling, and in
our shrubbery, seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing.
I was dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness,
but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice
of my dead mother come back to comfort me.  The sounds seemed
to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear their bare
feet pattering outside my door.  I called to them, and they
came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it
was that lay over me on the bed, they screamed out.  The wind
rushed in through the broken window, and the door slammed to.
They lifted off the body of my dear mother, and laid her,
covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I had got up.
They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them
to go to the dining room and each have a glass of wine.
The door flew open for an instant and closed again.
The maids shrieked, and then went in a body to the dining room,
and I laid what flowers I had on my dear mother's breast.
When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing
had told me, but I didn't like to remove them, and besides,
I would have some of the servants to sit up with me now.
I was surprised that the maids did not come back.
I called them, but got no answer, so I went to the dining room
to look for them.

My heart sank when I saw what had happened.  They all four
lay helpless on the floor, breathing heavily.  The decanter
of sherry was on the table half full, but there was a queer,
acrid smell about.  I was suspicious, and examined the decanter.
It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the sideboard,
I found that the bottle which Mother's doctor uses for her--
oh! did use--was empty.  What am I to do?  What am I to do?
I am back in the room with Mother.  I cannot leave her, and I
am alone, save for the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged.
Alone with the dead!  I dare not go out, for I can hear the low
howl of the wolf through the broken window.

The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the
draught from the window, and the lights burn blue and dim.
What am I to do?  God shield me from harm this night!
I shall hide this paper in my breast, where they shall find
it when they come to lay me out.  My dear mother gone!
It is time that I go too.  Goodbye, dear Arthur, if I should
not survive this night.  God keep you, dear, and God help me!





CHAPTER 12


DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


18 September.--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.
Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone.
I knocked gently and rang as quietly as possible, for I
feared to disturb Lucy or her mother, and hoped to only bring
a servant to the door.  After a while, finding no response,
I knocked and rang again, still no answer.  I cursed the laziness
of the servants that they should lie abed at such an hour,
for it was now ten o'clock, and so rang and knocked again,
but more impatiently, but still without response.
Hitherto I had blamed only the servants, but now a terrible
fear began to assail me.  Was this desolation but another link
in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight round us?
Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too late?
I know that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of danger
to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses,
and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance
an entry anywhere.

I could find no means of ingress.  Every window and door was
fastened and locked, and I returned baffled to the porch.
As I did so, I heard the rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse's feet.
They stopped at the gate, and a few seconds later I met Van
Helsing running up the avenue.  When he saw me, he gasped out,
""Then it was you, and just arrived.  How is she?  Are we too late?
Did you not get my telegram?""

I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got
his telegram early in the morning, and had not a minute in coming here,
and that I could not make any one in the house hear me.  He paused
and raised his hat as he said solemnly, ""Then I fear we are too late.
God's will be done!""

With his usual recuperative energy, he went on, ""Come.
If there be no way open to get in, we must make one.
Time is all in all to us now.""

We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen window.
The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and handing
it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window.
I attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them.
Then with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes
and opened the window.  I helped the Professor in, and followed him.
There was no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms, which were close
at hand.  We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining room,
dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four servant
women lying on the floor.  There was no need to think them dead,
for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room
left no doubt as to their condition.

Van Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we moved away he said,
""We can attend to them later.""Then we ascended to Lucy's room.
For an instant or two we paused at the door to listen, but there was
no sound that we could hear.  With white faces and trembling hands,
we opened the door gently, and entered the room.

How shall I describe what we saw?  On the bed lay two women,
Lucy and her mother.  The latter lay farthest in, and she
was covered with a white sheet, the edge of which had been
blown back by the drought through the broken window, showing
the drawn, white, face, with a look of terror fixed upon it.
By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more drawn.
The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon
her mother's bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two
little wounds which we had noticed before, but looking
horribly white and mangled.  Without a word the Professor bent
over the bed, his head almost touching poor Lucy's breast.
Then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who listens,
and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me, ""It is not yet
too late!  Quick!  Quick!  Bring the brandy!""

I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and
taste it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry
which I found on the table.  The maids were still breathing,
but more restlessly, and I fancied that the narcotic was wearing off.
I did not stay to make sure, but returned to Van Helsing.
He rubbed the brandy, as on another occasion, on her lips
and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her hands.
He said to me, ""I can do this, all that can be at the present.
You go wake those maids.  Flick them in the face with a wet towel,
and flick them hard.  Make them get heat and fire and a warm bath.
This poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her.
She will need be heated before we can do anything more.""

I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the women.
The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently affected
her more strongly so I lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep.

The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came
back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner.
I was stern with them, however, and would not let them talk.
I told them that one life was bad enough to lose, and if they
delayed they would sacrifice Miss Lucy.  So, sobbing and
crying they went about their way, half clad as they were,
and prepared fire and water.  Fortunately, the kitchen and boiler
fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water.
We got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it.
Whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door.
One of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it.
Then she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman
who had come with a message from Mr. Holmwood.  I bade her simply
tell him that he must wait, for we could see no one now.
She went away with the message, and, engrossed with our work,
I clean forgot all about him.

I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly earnest.
I knew, as he knew, that it was a stand-up fight with death, and in a
pause told him so.  He answered me in a way that I did not understand,
but with the sternest look that his face could wear.

""If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her
fade away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.""
He went on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.

Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning
to be of some effect.  Lucy's heart beat a trifle more audibly
to the stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement.
Van Helsing's face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from
the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me,
""The first gain is ours!  Check to the King!""

We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared,
and laid her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat.
I noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat.
She was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than,
we had ever seen her.

Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay
with her and not to take her eyes off her till we returned,
and then beckoned me out of the room.

""We must consult as to what is to be done,"" he said as we
descended the stairs.  In the hall he opened the dining room door,
and we passed in, he closing the door carefully behind him.
The shutters had been opened, but the blinds were already down,
with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the British
woman of the lower classes always rigidly observes.  The room was,
therefore, dimly dark.  It was, however, light enough for our purposes.
Van Helsing's sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity.
He was evidently torturing his mind about something, so I waited
for an instant, and he spoke.

""What are we to do now?  Where are we to turn for help?
We must have another transfusion of blood, and that soon,
or that poor girl's life won't be worth an hour's purchase.
You are exhausted already.  I am exhausted too.  I fear to trust
those women, even if they would have courage to submit.
What are we to do for some one who will open his veins for her?""

""What's the matter with me, anyhow?""

The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought relief
and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris.

Van Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened
and a glad look came into his eyes as I cried out, ""Quincey Morris!""
and rushed towards him with outstretched hands.

""What brought you her?""  I cried as our hands met.

""I guess Art is the cause.""

He handed me a telegram.--`Have not heard from Seward
for three days, and am terribly anxious.  Cannot leave.
Father still in same condition.  Send me word how Lucy is.
Do not delay.--Holmwood.'

""I think I came just in the nick of time.  You know you have only to tell me
what to do.""

Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him
straight in the eyes as he said, ""A brave man's blood is
the best thing on this earth when a woman is in trouble.
You're a man and no mistake.  Well, the devil may work against us
for all he's worth, but God sends us men when we want them.""

Once again we went through that ghastly operation.
I have not the heart to go through with the details.
Lucy had got a terrible shock and it told on her more than before,
for though plenty of blood went into her veins, her body did
not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions.
Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see and hear.
However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van
Helsing made a sub-cutaneous injection of morphia, as before,
and with good effect.  Her faint became a profound slumber.
The Professor watched whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris,
and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen
who were waiting.

I left Quincey lying down after having a glass of wine,
and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast.  Then a thought
struck me, and I went back to the room where Lucy now was.
When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet
or two of note paper in his hand.  He had evidently read it,
and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow.
There was a look of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one
who has had a doubt solved.  He handed me the paper saying only,
""It dropped from Lucy's breast when we carried her to the bath.""

When I had read it, I stook looking at the Professor, and after
a pause asked him, ""In God's name, what does it all mean?
Was she, or is she, mad, or what sort of horrible danger is it?""
I was so bewildered that I did not know what to say more.
Van Helsing put out his hand and took the paper, saying,

""Do not trouble about it now.  Forget if for the present.
You shall know and understand it all in good time, but it will
be later.  And now what is it that you came to me to say?""
This brought me back to fact, and I was all myself again.

""I came to speak about the certificate of death.  If we do not act
properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would
have to be produced.  I am in hopes that we need have no inquest,
for if we had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did.
I know, and you know, and the other doctor who attended her knows,
that Mrs. Westenra had disease of the heart, and we can certify
that she died of it.  Let us fill up the certificate at once, and I
shall take it myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker.""

""Good, oh my friend John!  Well thought of!  Truly Miss Lucy, if she
be sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends
thatlove her.  One, two, three, all open their veins for her,
besides one old man.  Ah, yes, I know, friend John.  I am not blind!
I love you all the more for it!  Now go.""

In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling
him that Mrs. Westenra was dead, that Lucy also had been ill,
but was now going on better, and that Van Helsing and I were with her.
I told him where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I
was going said,

""When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to ourselves?""
I nodded in reply and went out.  I found no difficulty about the registration,
and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in the evening to measure
for the coffin and to make arrangements.

When I got back Quincey was waiting for me.  I told him I would
see him as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room.
She was still sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved
from his seat at her side.  From his putting his finger to his lips,
I gathered that he expected her to wake before long and was afraid
of fore-stalling nature.  So I went down to Quincey and took him
into the breakfast room, where the blinds were not drawn down,
and which was a little more cheerful, or rather less cheerless,
than the other rooms.

When we were alone, he said to me, ""Jack Seward, I don't want to shove
myself in anywhere where I've no right to be, but this is no ordinary case.
You know I loved that girl and wanted to marry her, but although that's
all past and gone, I can't help feeling anxious about her all the same.
What is it that's wrong with her?  The Dutchman, and a fine old fellow is is,
I can see that, said that time you two came into the room, that you must
have another transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.
Now I know well that you medical men speak in camera, and that a
man must not expect to know what they consult about in private.
But this is no common matter, and whatever it is, I have done my part.
Is not that so?""

""That's so,"" I said, and he went on.

""I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did today.
Is not that so?""

""That's so.""

""And I guess Art was in it too.  When I saw him four days
ago down at his own place he looked queer.  I have not seen
anything pulled down so quick since I was on the Pampas
and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass all in a night.
One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her
in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open,
there wasn't enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I
had to put a bullet through her as she lay.  Jack, if you may
tell me without betraying confidence, Arthur was the first,
is not that so?""

As he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious.  He was in a torture
of suspense regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of
the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain.
His very heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him,
and there was a royal lot of it, too, to keep him from breaking down.
I paused before answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything
which the Professor wished kept secret, but already he knew so much,
and guessed so much, that there could be no reason for not answering,
so I answered in the same phrase.

""That's so.""

""And how long has this been going on?""

""About ten days.""

""Ten days!  Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature
that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood
of four strong men.  Man alive, her whole body wouldn't hold it.""
Then coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper. ""What
took it out?""

I shook my head.  ""That,"" I said, ""is the crux.  Van Helsing is simply
frantic about it, and I am at my wits' end.  I can't even hazard a guess.
There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown
out all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched.
But these shall not occur again.  Here we stay until all be well, or ill.""

Quincey held out his hand.  ""Count me in,"" he said.
""You and the Dutchman will tell me what to do, and I'll do it.""

When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy's first movement was to feel
in her breast, and to my surprise, produced the paper which Van
Helsing had given me to read.  The careful Professor had replaced
it where it had come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed.
Her eyes then lit on Van Helsing and on me too, and gladdened.
Then she looked round the room, and seeing where she was, shuddered.
She gave a loud cry, and put her poor thin hands before her pale face.

We both understood what was meant, that she had realized to the full
her mother's death.  So we tried what we could to comfort her.
Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but she was very low in
thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a long time.
We told her that either or both of us would now remain
with her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her.
Towards dusk she fell into a doze.  Here a very odd thing occurred.
Whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it
in two.  Van Helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her.
All the same, however, she went on with the action of tearing,
as though the material were still in her hands.  Finally she lifted
her hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments.
Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as if in thought,
but he said nothing.


19 September.--All last night she slept fitfully, being always
afraid to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it.
The Professor and I took in turns to watch, and we never left
her for a moment unattended.  Quincey Morris said nothing
about his intention, but I knew that all night long he patrolled
round and round the house.

When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor
Lucy's strength.  She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little
nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good.
At times she slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference
in her, between sleeping and waking.  Whilst asleep she looked
stronger, although more haggard, and her breathing was softer.
Her open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth,
which looked positively longer and sharper than usual.
When she woke the softness of her eyes evidently changed
the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying one.
In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.
Quincey went off to meet him at the station.

When he arrived it was nearly six o'clock, and the sun was setting
full and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window
and gave more color to the pale cheeks.  When he saw her,
Arthur was simply choking with emotion, and none of us could speak.
In the hours that had passed, the fits of sleep, or the comatose
condition that passed for it, had grown more frequent,
so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened.
Arthur's presence, however, seemed to act as a stimulant.
She rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she
had done since we arrived.  He too pulled himself together,
and spoke as cheerily as he could, so that the best was
made of everything.

It is now nearly one o'clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with her.
I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering this
on Lucy's phonograph.  Until six o'clock they are to try to rest.
I fear that tomorrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too great.
The poor child cannot rally.  God help us all.




LETTER MINA HARKER TO LUCY WESTENRA

(Unopened by her)


17 September

My dearest Lucy,

""It seems an age since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote.
You will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read
all my budget of news.  Well, I got my husband back all right.
When we arrived at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us,
and in it, though he had an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins.
He took us to his house, where there were rooms for us
all nice and comfortable, and we dined together.
After dinner Mr. Hawkins said,

"" `My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity, and may every
blessing attend you both.  I know you both from children, and have,
with love and pride, seen you grow up.  Now I want you to make
your home here with me.  I have left to me neither chick nor child.
All are gone, and in my will I have left you everything.'
I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and the old man clasped hands.
Our evening was a very, very happy one.

""So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from
both my bedroom and the drawing room I can see the great elms
of the cathedral close, with their great black stems standing
out against the old yellow stone of the cathedral, and I can hear
the rooks overhead cawing and cawing and chattering and chattering
and gossiping all day, after the manner of rooks--and humans.
I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and housekeeping.
Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day, for now that Jonathan
is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the clients.

""How is your dear mother getting on?  I wish I could run up
to town for a day or two to see you, dear, but I, dare not go yet,
with so much on my shoulders, and Jonathan wants looking after still.
He is beginning to put some flesh on his bones again,
but he was terribly weakened by the long illness.  Even now
he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden way and awakes
all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual placidity.
However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the days
go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust.
And now I have told you my news, let me ask yours.  When are you
to be married, and where, and who is to perform the ceremony,
and what are you to wear, and is it to be a public or private wedding?
Tell me all about it, dear, tell me all about everything, for there
is nothing which interests you which will not be dear to me.
Jonathan asks me to send his `respectful duty', but I do not think
that is good enough from the junior partner of the important
firm Hawkins & Harker.  And so, as you love me, and he loves me,
and I love you with all the moods and tenses of the verb,
I send you simply his `love' instead.  Goodbye, my dearest Lucy,
and blessings on you.""  Yours, Mina Harker



REPORT FROM PATRICK HENNESSEY, MD, MRCSLK, QCPI, ETC, ETC, TO JOHN SEWARD, MD

20 September

My dear Sir:

""In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report
of the conditions of everything left in my charge.
With regard to patient, Renfield, there is more to say.
He has had another outbreak, which might have had a dreadful ending,
but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended with any
unhappy results.  This afternoon a carrier's cart with two men
made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours,
the house to which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away.
The men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way,
as they were strangers.

""I was myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke
after dinner, and saw one of them come up to the house.
As he passed the window of Renfield's room, the patient
began to rate him from within, and called him all the foul
names he could lay his tongue to.  The man, who seemed
a decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him
to `shut up for a foul-mouthed beggar', whereon our man
accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and said
that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it.
I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,
so he contented himself after looking the place over and making
up his mind as to what kind of place he had got to by saying,
`Lor' bless yer, sir, I wouldn't mind what was said to me
in a bloomin' madhouse.  I pity ye and the guv'nor for havin'
to live in the house with a wild beast like that.'

""Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him
where the gate of the empty house was.  He went away
followed by threats and curses and revilings from our man.
I went down to see if I could make out any cause for his anger,
since he is usually such a well-behaved man, and except
his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred.
I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most genial
in his manner.  I tried to get him to talk of the incident,
but he blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led
me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair.
It was, I am sorry to say, however, only another instance
of his cunning, for within half an hour I heard of him again.
This time he had broken out through the window of his room,
and was running down the avenue.  I called to the attendants
to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent
on some mischief.  My fear was justified when I saw the same
cart which had passed before coming down the road, having on it
some great wooden boxes.  The men were wiping their foreheads,
and were flushed in the face, as if with violent exercise.
Before I could get up to him, the patient rushed at them,
and pulling one of them off the cart, began to knock his head
against the ground.  If I had not seized him just at the moment,
I believe he would have killed the man there and then.
The other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head
with the butt end of his heavy whip.  It was a horrible blow,
but he did not seem to mind it, but seized him also, and struggled
with the three of us, pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens.
You know I am no lightweight, and the others were both burly men.
At first he was silent in his fighting, but as we began to master him,
and the attendants were putting a strait waistcoat on him,
he began to shout, `I'll frustrate them!  They shan't rob me!
They shan't murder me by inches!  I'll fight for my Lord
and Master!'and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings.
It was with very considerable difficulty that they got
him back to the house and put him in the padded room.
One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken.
However, I set it all right, and he is going on well.

""The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions
for damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us.
Their threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect
apology for the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman.
They said that if it had not been for the way their strength
had been spent in carrying and raising the heavy boxes
to the cart they would have made short work of him.
They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary
state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty
nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from
the scene of their labors of any place of public entertainment.
I quite understood their drift, and after a stiff glass
of strong grog, or rather more of the same, and with each
a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore
that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure
of meeting so `bloomin' good a bloke' as your correspondent.
I took their names and addresses, in case they might be needed.
They are as follows:  Jack Smollet, of Dudding's Rents,
King George's Road, Great Walworth, and Thomas Snelling,
Peter Farley's Row, Guide Court, Bethnal Green.  They are both
in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving and Shipment Company,
Orange Master's Yard, Soho.

""I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here,
and shall wire you at once if there is anything of importance.

""Believe me, dear Sir,

""Yours faithfully,

""Patrick Hennessey.""



LETTER, MINA HARKER TO LUCY WESTENRA (Unopened by her)


18 September

""My dearest Lucy,

""Such a sad blow has befallen us.  Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.
Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so
love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father.
I never knew either father or mother, so that the dear old man's
death is a real blow to me.  Jonathan is greatly distressed.
It is not only that he feels sorrow, deep sorrow, for the dear,
good man who has befriended him all his life, and now at
the end has treated him like his own son and left him a fortune
which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond
the dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account.
He says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes
him nervous.  He begins to doubt himself.  I try to cheer him up,
and my belief in him helps him to have a belief in himself.
But it is here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon
him the most.  Oh, it is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble,
strong nature such as his, a nature which enabled him by our dear,
good friend's aid to rise from clerk to master in a few years,
should be so injured that the very essence of its strength is gone.
Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in the midst of your
own happiness, but Lucy dear, I must tell someone, for the strain
of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan tries me,
and I have no one here that I can confide in.  I dread coming up to London,
as we must do that day after tomorrow, for poor Mr. Hawkins left
in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his father.
As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief mourner.
I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few minutes.
Forgive me for troubling you.  With all blessings,

""Your loving

Mina Harker""



DR.  SEWARD' DIARY


20 September.--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry tonight.
I am too miserable, too low spirited, too sick of the world
and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I
heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death.
And he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late,
Lucy's mother and Arthur's father, and now.  . . Let me get on
with my work.

I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy.
We wanted Arthur to go to rest also, but he refused at first.
It was only when I told him that we should want him to help us
during the day, and that we must not all break down for want
of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed to go.

Van Helsing was very kind to him.  ""Come, my child,"" he said.
""Come with me.  You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much
mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of.
You must not be alone, for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.
Come to the drawing room, where there is a big fire, and there are two sofas.
You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will be comfort
to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we sleep.""

Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy's face,
which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn.
She lay quite still, and I looked around the room to see that all
was as it should be.  I could see that the Professor had carried
out in this room, as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic.
The whole of the window sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy's neck,
over the silk handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on,
was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers.

Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face was at its worst,
for the open mouth showed the pale gums.  Her teeth, in the dim,
uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning.
In particular, by some trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer
and sharper than the rest.

I sat down beside her, and presently she moved uneasily.  At the same
moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window.
I went over to it softly, and peeped out by the corner of the blind.
There was a full moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made
by a great bat, which wheeled around, doubtless attracted by the light,
although so dim, and every now and again struck the window with its wings.
When I came back to my seat, I found that Lucy had moved slightly,
and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat.  I replaced them
as well as I could, and sat watching her.

Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing
had prescribed.  She took but a little, and that languidly.
There did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle
for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her illness.
It struck me as curious that the moment she became
conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her.
It was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state,
with the stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her,
but that when she waked she clutched them close, There was no
possibility of making amy mistake about this, for in the long
hours that followed, she had many spells of sleeping and waking
and repeated both actions many times.

At six o'clock Van Helsing came to relieve me.  Arthur had
then fallen into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on.
When he saw Lucy's face I could hear the sissing indraw of breath,
and he said to me in a sharp whisper.""Draw up the blind.
I want light!""  Then he bent down, and, with his face
almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully.  He removed
the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat.
As he did so he started back and I could hear his ejaculation,
""Mein Gott!"" as it was smothered in his throat.  I bent over
and looked, too, and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.
The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.

For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his
face at its sternest.  Then he turned to me and said calmly,
""She is dying.  It will not be long now.  It will be much difference,
mark me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep.
Wake that poor boy, and let him come and see the last.
He trusts us, and we have promised him.""

I went to the dining room and waked him.  He was dazed for a moment,
but when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges
of the shutters he thought he was late, and expressed his fear.
I assured him that Lucy was still asleep, but told him as gently as i
could that both Van Helsing and I feared that the end was near.
He covered his face with his hands, and slid down on his
knees by the sofa, where he remained, perhaps a minute,
with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders shook
with grief.  I took him by the hand and raised him up.
""Come,"" I said, ""my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude.
It will be best and easiest for her.""

When we came into Lucy's room I could see that Van Helsing had,
with his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making
everything look as pleasing as possible.  He had even brushed
Lucy's hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples.
When we came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him,
whispered softly, ""Arthur!  Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!""

He was stooping to kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back.
""No,"" he whispered, ""not yet!  Hold her hand, it will comfort her more.""

So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,
with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes.
Then gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep.
For a little bit her breast heaved softly, and her breath came
and went like a tired child's.

And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed
in the night.  Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the
pale gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever.
In a sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes,
which were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,
such as I had never heard from her lips, ""Arthur!  Oh, my love,
I am so glad you have come!  Kiss me!""

Arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her, but at that instant
Van Helsing, who, like me, had been startled by her voice,
swooped upon him, and catching him by the neck with both hands,
dragged him back with a fury of strength which I never thought
he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost
across the room.

""Not on your life!"" he said, ""not for your living soul and hers!""
And he stood between them like a lion at bay.

Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do or say,
and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realized the place
and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.

I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we
saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over her face.
The sharp teeth clamped together.  Then her eyes closed,
and she breathed heavily.

Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness,
and putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing's
great brown one, drawing it close to her, she kissed it.
""My true friend,"" she said, in a faint voice, but with
untellable pathos, ""My true friend, and his!  Oh, guard him,
and give me peace!""

""I swear it!"" he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his hand,
as one who registers an oath.  Then he turned to Arthur, and said to him,
""Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the forehead,
and only once.""

Their eyes met instead of their lips, and so they parted.
Lucy's eyes closed, and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely,
took Arthur's arm, and drew him away.

And then Lucy's breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it ceased.

""It is all over,"" said Van Helsing.  ""She is dead!""

I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing room,
where he sat down, and covered his face with his hands,
sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see.

I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy,
and his face was sterner than eve.  Some change had come over her body.
Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had recovered
some of their flowing lines.  Even the lips had lost their deadly pallor.
It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working of the heart,
had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be.

""We thought her dying whilst she slept, And sleeping when she died.""


I stood beside Van Helsing, and said, ""Ah well, poor girl,
there is peace for her at last.  It is the end!""

He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity, ""Not so, alas!  Not so.
It is only the beginning!""

When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered,
""We can do nothing as yet.  Wait and see.""





CHAPTER 13


DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY--cont.


The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day,
so that Lucy and her mother might be buried together.
I attended to all the ghastly formalities, and the urbane
undertaker proved that his staff was afflicted, or blessed,
with something of his own obsequious suavity.  Even the woman
who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to me,
in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come
out from the death chamber,

""She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir.  It's quite a privilege
to attend on her.  It's not too much to say that she will do credit
to our establishment!""

I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away.  This was
possible from the disordered state of things in the household.
There were no relatives at hand, and as Arthur had to be back
the next day to attend at his father's funeral, we were unable to
notify any one who should have been bidden.  Under the circumstances,
Van Helsing and I took it upon ourselves to examine papers, etc.
He insisted upon looking over Lucy's papers himself.
I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a foreigner,
might not be quite aware of English legal requirements,
and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble.

He answered me, ""I know, I know.  You forget that I am
a lawyer as well as a doctor.  But this is not altogether
for the law.  You knew that, when you avoided the coroner.
I have more than him to avoid.  There may be papers more,
such as this.""

As he spoke he took from his pocket book the memorandum which had been
in Lucy's breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.

""When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs. Westenra,
seal all her papers, and write him tonight.  For me, I watch here in the room
and in Miss Lucy's old room all night, and I myself search for what may be.
It is not well that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers.""

I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour
had found the name and address of Mrs. Westenra's solicitor and
had written to him.  All the poor lady's papers were in order.
Explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given.
I had hardly sealed the letter, when, to my surprise,
Van Helsing walked into the room, saying,

""Can I help you friend John?  I am free, and if I may,
my service is to you.""

""Have you got what you looked for?""  I asked.

To which he replied, ""I did not look for any specific thing.
I only hoped to find, and find I have, all that there was,
only some letters and a few memoranda, and a diary new begun.
But I have them here, and we shall for the present say nothing of them.
I shall see that poor lad tomorrow evening, and, with his sanction,
I shall use some.""

When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me, ""And now,
friend John, I think we may to bed.  We want sleep, both you and I,
and rest to recuperate.  Tomorrow we shall have much to do,
but for the tonight there is no need of us.  Alas!""

Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy.  The undertaker
had certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into
a small chapelle ardente.  There was a wilderness of beautiful
white flowers, and death was made as little repulsive as might be.
The end of the winding sheet was laid over the face.
When the Professor bent over and turned it gently back,
we both started at the beauty before us.  The tall wax
candles showing a sufficient light to note it well.
All Lucy's loveliness had come back to her in death,
and the hours that had passed, instead of leaving traces of
`decay's effacing fingers', had but restored the beauty of life,
till positively I could not believe my eyes that I was looking
at a corpse.

The Professor looked sternly grave.  He had not loved her
as I had, and there was no need for tears in his eyes.
He said to me, ""Remain till I return,"" and left the room.
He came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box
waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened,
and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around
the bed.  Then he took from his neck, inside his collar,
a little gold crucifix, and placed it over the mouth.
He restored the sheet to its place, and we came away.

I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the door,
he entered, and at once began to speak.

""Tomorrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem knives.""

""Must we make an autopsy?""  I asked.

""Yes and no.  I want to operate, but not what you think.
Let me tell you now, but not a word to another.  I want to cut
off her head and take out her heart.  Ah!  You a surgeon,
and so shocked!  You, whom I have seen with no tremble
of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make
the rest shudder.  Oh, but I must not forget, my dear
friend John, that you loved her, and I have not forgotten
it for is I that shall operate, and you must not help.
I would like to do it tonight, but for Arthur I must not.
He will be free after his father's funeral tomorrow, and he will
want to see her, to see it.  Then, when she is coffined ready
for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep.
We shall unscrew the coffin lid, and shall do our operation,
and then replace all, so that none know, save we alone.""

""But why do it at all?  The girl is dead.  Why mutilate her poor body
without need?  And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing to
gain by it, no good to her, to us, to science, to human knowledge, why do it?
Without such it is monstrous.""

For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said,
with infinite tenderness, ""Friend John, I pity your poor
bleeding heart, and I love you the more because it does so bleed.
If I could, I would take on myself the burden that you do bear.
But there are things that you know not, but that you shall know,
and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant things.
John, my child, you have been my friend now many years,
and yet did you ever know me to do any without good cause?
I may err, I am but man, but I believe in all I do.
Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great
trouble came?  Yes!  Were you not amazed, nay horrified,
when I would not let Arthur kiss his love, though she was dying,
and snatched him away by all my strength?  Yes!  And yet you
saw how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes,
her voice, too, so weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and
bless me?  Yes!  And did you not hear me swear promise to her,
that so she closed her eyes grateful?  Yes!

""Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do.
You have for many years trust me.  You have believe me weeks past,
when there be things so strange that you might have well doubt.
Believe me yet a little, friend John.  If you trust me not,
then I must tell what I think, and that is not perhaps well.
And if I work, as work I shall, no matter trust or no trust,
without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel,
oh so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!""
He paused a moment and went on solemnly, ""Friend John,
there are strange and terrible days before us.
Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to a good end.
Will you not have faith in me?""

I took his hand, and promised him.  I held my door open as
he went away, and watched him go to his room and close the door.
As I stood without moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently
along the passage, she had her back to me, so did not see me,
and go into the room where Lucy lay.  The sight touched me.
Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful to those who show it
unasked to those we love.  Here was a poor girl putting aside
the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch alone
by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor
clay might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest.

I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight
when Van Helsing waked me by coming into my room.  He came over
to my bedside and said, ""You need not trouble about the knives.
We shall not do it.""

""Why not?""  I asked.  For his solemnity of the night before
had greatly impressed me.

""Because,"" he said sternly, ""it is too late, or too early.  See!""  Here he
held up the little golden crucifix.

""This was stolen in the night.""

""How stolen, ""I asked in wonder, ""since you have it now?""

""Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it,
from the woman who robbed the dead and the living.
Her punishment will surely come, but not through me.
She knew not altogether what she did, and thus unknowing,
she only stole.  Now we must wait.""  He went away on the word,
leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a new puzzle
to grapple with.

The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came,
Mr. Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale.
He was very genial and very appreciative of what we had done,
and took off our hands all cares as to details.  During lunch
he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for some time expected sudden
death from her heart, and had put her affairs in absolute order.
He informed us that, with the exception of a certain entailed
property of Lucy's father which now, in default of direct issue,
went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,
real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood.
When he had told us so much he went on,

""Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition,
and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her
daughter either penniless or not so free as she should be to act
regarding a matrimonial alliance.  Indeed, we pressed the matter
so far that we almost came into collision, for she asked us
if we were or were not prepared to carry out her wishes.
Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept.
We were right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of
a hundred we should have proved, by the logic of events,
the accuracy of our judgment.

""Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of
disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her wishes.
For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come into
possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her mother
by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no will,
and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case, have been
treated at her decease as under intestacy.  In which case Lord Godalming,
though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world.
And the inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their
just rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger.
I assure you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.""

He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part,
in which he was officially interested, of so great a tragedy,
was an object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.

He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day
and see Lord Godalming.  His coming, however, had been a certain
comfort to us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread
hostile criticism as to any of our acts.  Arthur was expected at five
o'clock, so a little before that time we visited the death chamber.
It was so in very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it.
The undertaker, true to his craft, had made the best display he could
of his goods, and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered
our spirits at once.

Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,
explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon,
it would be less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was
left of his fiancee quite alone.

The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted
himself to restore things to the condition in which we left
them the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks
to his feelings as we could avoid were saved.

Poor fellow!  He looked desperately sad and broken.  Even his stalwart manhood
seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his much-tried emotions.
He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly attached to his father,
and to lose him, and at such a time, was a bitter blow to him.
With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he was sweetly courteous.
But I could not help seeing that there was some constraint with him.
The professor noticed it too, and motioned me to bring him upstairs.
I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I felt he would like to
be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and led me in, saying huskily,

""You loved her too, old fellow.  She told me all about it,
and there was no friend had a closer place in her heart than you.
I don't know how to thank you for all you have done for her.
I can't think yet.  . .""

Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and laid
his head on my breast, crying, ""Oh, Jack!  Jack!  What shall I do?
The whole of life seems gone from me all at once, and there is nothing
in the wide world for me to live for.""

I comforted him as well as I could.  In such cases men do not need
much expression.  A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm
over the shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear
to a man's heart.  I stood still and silent till his sobs died away,
and then I said softly to him, ""Come and look at her.""

Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted
the lawn from her face.  God!  How beautiful she was.
Every hour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness.
It frightened and amazed me somewhat.  And as for Arthur, he fell
to trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague.
At last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper,
""Jack, is she really dead?""

I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest, for I felt
that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than I
could help, that it often happened that after death faces become softened
and even resolved into their youthful beauty, that this was especially
so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering.
I seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and after kneeling beside the couch
for a while and looking at her lovingly and long, he turned aside.
I told him that that must be goodbye, as the coffin had to be prepared,
so he went back and took her dead hand in his and kissed it, and bent
over and kissed her forehead.  He came away, fondly looking back over
his shoulder at her as he came.

I left him in the drawing room, and told Van Helsing that he had said goodbye,
so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker's men to proceed with
the preperations and to screw up the coffin.  When he came out of the room
again I told him of Arthur's question, and he replied, ""I am not surprised.
Just now I doubted for a moment myself!""

We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying
to make the best of things.  Van Helsing had been silent all
dinner time, but when we had lit our cigars he said, ""Lord.
. ., but Arthur interrupted him.

""No, no, not that, for God's sake!  Not yet at any rate.
Forgive me, sir.  I did not mean to speak offensively.
It is only because my loss is so recent.""

The Professor answered very sweetly, ""I only used that name
because I was in doubt.  I must not call you `Mr.' and I have
grown to love you, yes, my dear boy, to love you, as Arthur.""

Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man's warmly.
""Call me what you will,"" he said.  ""I hope I may always have
the title of a friend.  And let me say that I am at a loss
for words to thank you for your goodness to my poor dear.""
He paused a moment, and went on, ""I know that she understood
your goodness even better than I do.  And if I was rude or in
any way wanting at that time you acted so, you remember,""--
the Professor nodded--""You must forgive me.""

He answered with a grave kindness, ""I know it was hard for you to
quite trust me then, for to trust such violence needs to understand,
and I take it that you do not, that you cannot, trust me now, for you
do not yet understand.  And there may be more times when I shall want
you to trust when you cannot, and may not, and must not yet understand.
But the time will come when your trust shall be whole and complete in me,
and when you shall understand as though the sunlight himself shone through.
Then you shall bless me from first to last for your own sake, and for
the sake of others, and for her dear sake to whom I swore to protect.""

""And indeed, indeed, sir,"" said Arthur warmly.  ""I shall
in all ways trust you.  I know and believe you have a very
noble heart, and you are Jack's friend, and you were hers.
You shall do what you like.""

The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to speak,
and finally said, ""May I ask you something now?""

""Certainly.""

""You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?""

""No, poor dear.  I never thought of it.""

""And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will.
I want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy's papers and letters.
Believe me, it is no idle curiosity.  I have a motive of which, be sure,
she would have approved.  I have them all here.  I took them before we
knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch them,
no strange eye look through words into her soul.  I shall keep them,
if I may.  Even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them safe.
No word shall be lost, and in the good time I shall give them back to you.
It is a hard thing that I ask, but you will do it, will you not,
for Lucy's sake?""

Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self, ""Dr. Van Helsing,
you may do what you will.  I feel that in saying this I am doing
what my dear one would have approved.  I shall not trouble you
with questions till the time comes.""

The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly, ""And you are right.
There will be pain for us all, but it will not be all pain, nor will
this pain be the last.  We and you too, you most of all, dear boy,
will have to pass through the bitter water before we reach the sweet.
But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our duty,
and all will be well!""

I slept on a sofa in Arthur's room that night.  Van Helsing did not
go to bed at all.  He went to and fro, as if patroling the house,
and was never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin,
strewn with the wild garlic flowers, which sent through the odor
of lily and rose, a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.




MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


22 September.--In the train to Exeter.  Jonathan sleeping.
It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet
how much between then, in Whitby and all the world before me,
Jonathan away and no news of him, and now, married to Jonathan,
Jonathan a solicitor, a partner, rich, master of his business,
Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and Jonathan with another attack
that may harm him.  Some day he may ask me about it.
Down it all goes.  I am rusty in my shorthand, see what unexpected
prosperity does for us, so it may be as well to freshen it up
again with an exercise anyhow.

The service was very simple and very solemn.  There were only
ourselves and the servants there, one or two old friends of his
from Exeter, his London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir
John Paxton, the President of the Incorporated Law Society.
Jonathan and I stood hand in hand, and we felt that our best
and dearest friend was gone from us.

We came back to town quietly, taking a bus to Hyde Park Corner.
Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for
a while, so we sat down.  But there were very few people there,
and it was sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs.
It made us think of the empty chair at home.  So we got up
and walked down Piccadilly.  Jonathan was holding me by the arm,
the way he used to in the old days before I went to school.
I felt it very improper, for you can't go on for some years
teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry
of it biting into yourself a bit.  But it was Jonathan,
and he was my husband, and we didn't know anybody who saw us,
and we didn't care if they did, so on we walked.
I was looking at a very beautiful girl, in a big cart-wheel hat,
sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano's, when I felt Jonathan
clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said under
his breath, ""My God!""

I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I fear that some
nervous fit may upset him again.  So I turned to him quickly,
and asked him what it was that disturbed him.

He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in
terror and half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man,
with a beaky nose and black moustache and pointed beard, who was
also observing the pretty girl.  He was looking at her so hard
that he did not see either of us, and so I had a good view of him.
His face was not a good face.  It was hard, and cruel,
and sensual, and big white teeth, that looked all the whiter
because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal's.
Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice.
I feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty.
I asked Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered,
evidently thinking that I knew as much about it as he did,
""Do you see who it is?""

""No, dear,"" I said.  ""I don't know him, who is it?""
His answer seemed to shock and thrill me, for it was said as if
he did not know that it was me, Mina, to whom he was speaking.
""It is the man himself!""

The poor dear was evidently terrified at something, very greatly terrified.
I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to support him
he would have sunk down.  He kept staring.  A man came out of the shop
with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove off.
Th e dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage moved
up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a hansom.
Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself,

""I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young.  My God, if this
be so!  Oh, my God!  My God!  If only I knew!  If only I knew!""
He was distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind
on the subject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent.
I drew away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily.
We walked a little further, and then went in and sat for
a while in the Green Park.  It was a hot day for autumn,
and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.
After a few minutes' staring at nothing, Jonathan's eyes closed,
and he went quickly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder.
I thought it was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him.
In about twenty minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully,

""Why, Mina, have I been asleep!  Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.
Come, and we'll have a cup of tea somewhere.""

He had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger,
as in his illness he had forgotten all that this episode had
reminded him of.  I don't like this lapsing into forgetfulness.
It may make or continue some injury to the brain.
I must not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good,
but I must somehow learn the facts of his journey abroad.
The time is come, I fear, when I must open the parcel,
and know what is written.  Oh, Jonathan, you will, I know,
forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.


Later.--A sad homecoming in every way, the house empty
of the dear soul who was so good to us.  Jonathan still
pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of his malady,
and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he may be.
""You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five
days ago, and that Lucy died the day before yesterday.
They were both buried today.""

Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words!  Poor Mrs. Westenra!
Poor Lucy!  Gone, gone, never to return to us!  And poor,
poor Arthur, to have lost such a sweetness out of his life!
God help us all to bear our troubles.


DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY-CONT.


22 September.--It is all over.  Arthur has gone back to Ring,
and has taken Quincey Morris with him.  What a fine fellow
is Quincey!  I believe in my heart of hearts that he suffered
as much about Lucy's death as any of us, but he bore himself
through it like a moral Viking.  If America can go on breeding
men like that, she will be a power in the world indeed.
Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his journey.
He goes to Amsterdam tonight, but says he returns tomorrow night,
that he only wants to make some arrangements which can only
be made personally.  He is to stop with me then, if he can.
He says he has work to do in London which may take him some time.
Poor old fellow!  I fear that the strain of the past week has
broken down even his iron strength.  All the time of the burial
he was, I could see, putting some terrible restraint on himself.
When it was all over, we were standing beside Arthur, who,
poor fellow, was speaking of his part in the operation
where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy's veins.
I could see Van Helsing's face grow white and purple by turns.
Arthur was saying that he felt since then as if they two had been
really married, and that she was his wife in the sight of God.
None of us said a word of the other operations, and none
of us ever shall.  Arthur and Quincey went away together
to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here.
The moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a
regular fit of hysterics.  He has denied to me since that it
was hysterics, and insisted that it was only his sense
of humor asserting itself under very terrible conditions.
He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down the blinds
lest any one should see us and misjudge.  And then he cried,
till he laughed again, and laughed and cried together,
just as a woman does.  I tried to be stern with him, as one
is to a woman under the circumstances, but it had no effect.
Men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous
strength or weakness!  Then when his face grew grave and stern
again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.
His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical
and forceful and mysterious.  He said,

""Ah, you don't comprehend, friend John.  Do not think that I am
not sad, though I laugh.  See, I have cried even when the laugh
did choke me.  But no more think that I am all sorry when I cry,
for the laugh he come just the same.  Keep it always with you
that laughter who knock at your door and say, `May I come in?'
is not true laughter.  No!  He is a king, and he come when and how
he like.  He ask no person, he choose no time of suitability.
He say, `I am here.'  Behold, in example I grieve my heart
out for that so sweet young girl.  I give my blood for her,
though I am old and worn.  I give my time, my skill, my sleep.
I let my other sufferers want that she may have all.
And yet I can laugh at her very grave, laugh when the clay from
the spade of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say `Thud, thud!'
to my heart, till it send back the blood from my cheek.
My heart bleed for that poor boy, that dear boy, so of
the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live,
and with his hair and eyes the same.

""There, you know now why I love him so.  And yet when
he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick,
and make my father-heart yearn to him as to no other man,
not even you, friend John, for we are more level in experiences
than father and son, yet even at such a moment King Laugh
he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear,`Here I am!
Here I am!' till the blood come dance back and bring
some of the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek.
Oh, friend John, it is a strange world, a sad world, a world
full of miseries, and woes, and troubles.  And yet when King
Laugh come, he make them all dance to the tune he play.
Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and tears that
burn as they fall, all dance together to the music that he make
with that smileless mouth of him.  And believe me, friend John,
that he is good to come, and kind.  Ah, we men and women are
like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways.
Then tears come, and like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up,
until perhaps the strain become too great, and we break.
But King Laugh he come like the sunshine, and he ease off
the strain again, and we bear to go on with our labor,
what it may be.""

I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea,
but as I did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him.
As he answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite
a different tone,

""Oh, it was the grim irony of it all, this so lovely lady garlanded
with flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we
wondered if she were truly dead, she laid in that so fine marble
house in that lonely churchyard, where rest so many of her kin,
laid there with the mother who loved her, and whom she loved,
and that sacred bell going ""Toll!  Toll!  Toll!' so sad and slow,
and those holy men, with the white garments of the angel,
pretending to read books, and yet all the time their eyes never on
the page, and all of us with the bowed head.  And all for what?
She is dead, so!  Is it not?""

""Well, for the life of me, Professor,"" I said, ""I can't see
anything to laugh at in all that.  Why, your expression makes
it a harder puzzle than before.  But even if the burial
service was comic, what about poor Art and his trouble?
Why his heart was simply breaking.""

""Just so.  Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins
had made her truly his bride?""

""Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.""

""Quite so.  But there was a difficulty, friend John.
If so that, then what about the others?  Ho, ho!  Then this so sweet
maid is a polyandrist, and me, with my poor wife dead to me,
but alive by Church's law, though no wits, all gone, even I,
who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife, am bigamist.""

""I don't see where the joke comes in there either!""  I said, and I
did not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things.
He laid his hand on my arm, and said,

""Friend John, forgive me if I pain.  I showed not my feeling to others
when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust.
If you could have looked into my heart then when I want to laugh,
if you could have done so when the laugh arrived, if you could do so now,
when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him,
for he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time, maybe you
would perhaps pity me the most of all.""

I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.

""Because I know!""

And now we are all scattered, and for many a long day loneliness will sit
over our roofs with brooding wings.  Lucy lies in the tomb of her kin,
a lordly death house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming London,
where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill,
and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.

So I can finish this diary, and God only knows if I shall ever begin another.
If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with different
people and different themes, for here at the end, where the romance of my life
is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my life-work, I say sadly
and without hope, ""FINIS"".




THE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE, 25 SEPTEMBER A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY


The neighborhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised
with a series of events which seem to run on lines parallel
to those of what was known to the writers of headlines
and ""The Kensington Horror,"" or ""The Stabbing Woman,""
or ""The Woman in Black.""  During the past two or three days
several cases have occurred of young children straying from
home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath.
In all these cases the children were too young to give any
properly intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus
of their excuses is that they had been with a ""bloofer lady.""
It has always been late in the evening when they have
been missed, and on two occasions the children have
not been found until early in the following morning.
It is generally supposed in the neighborhood that,
as the first child missed gave as his reason for being away
that a ""bloofer lady"" had asked him to come for a walk,
the others had picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served.
This is the more natural as the favorite game of the little
ones at present is luring each other away by wiles.
A correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots
pretending to be the""bloofer lady"" is supremely funny.
Some of our caricaturists might, he says, take a lesson in
the irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture.
It is only in accordance with general principles of human
nature that the ""bloofer lady"" should be the popular role
at these al fresco performances.  Our correspondent naively
says that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive
as some of these grubby-faced little children pretend,
and even imagine themselves, to be.

There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question,
for some of the children, indeed all who have been missed
at night, have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat.
The wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a small dog,
and although of not much importance individually, would tend
to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system
or method of its own.  The police of the division have been
instructed to keep a sharp lookout for straying children,
especially when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath,
and for any stray dog which may be about.




THE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE, 25 SEPTEMBER EXTRA SPECIAL

THE HAMPSTEAD HORROR


ANOTHER CHILD INJURED

THE ""BLOOFER LADY""


We have just received intelligence that another child,
missed last night, was only discovered late in the morning
under a furze bush at the Shooter's Hill side of Hampstead Heath,
which is perhaps, less frequented than the other parts.
It has the same tiny wound in the throat as has been noticed
in other cases.  It was terribly weak, and looked quite emaciated.
It too, when partially restored, had the common story to tell
of being lured away by the ""bloofer lady"".





CHAPTER 14


MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


23 September.--Jonathan is better after a bad night.
I am so glad that he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps
his mind off the terrible things, and oh, I am rejoiced that he is
not now weighed down with the responsibility of his new position.
I knew he would be true to himself, and now how proud I am to see
my Jonathan rising to the height of his advancement and keeping
pace in all ways with the duties that come upon him.  He will be
away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch at home.
My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign journal,
and lock myself up in my room and read it.


24 September.--I hadn't the heart to write last night,
that terrible record of Jonathan's upset me so.  Poor dear!
How he must have suffered, whether it be true or only imagination.
I wonder if there is any truth in it at all.  Did he get
his brain fever, and then write all those terrible things,
or had he some cause for it all?  I suppose I shall never know,
for I dare not open the subject to him.  And yet that man we
saw yesterday!  He seemed quite certain of him, poor fellow!
I suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back
on some train of thought.

He believes it all himself.  I remember how on our wedding
day he said ""Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go
back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane.
. ."" There seems to be through it all some thread of continuity.
That fearful Count was coming to London.  If it should be,
and he came to London, with its teeming millions.  . .There may
be a solemn duty, and if it come we must not shrink from it.
I shall be prepared.  I shall get my typewriter this very hour
and begin transcribing.  Then we shall be ready for other eyes
if required.  And if it be wanted, then, perhaps, if I am ready,
poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him
and never let him be troubled or worried with it at all.
If ever Jonathan quite gets over the nervousness he may want
to tell me of it all, and I can ask him questions and find
out things, and see how I may comfort him.




LETTER, VAN HELSING TO MRS.  HARKER


24 September

(Confidence)

""Dear Madam,

""I pray you to pardon my writing, in that I am so far friend
as that I sent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra's death.
By the kindness of Lord Godalming, I am empowered to read her
letters and papers, for I am deeply concerned about certain
matters vitally important.  In them I find some letters from you,
which show how great friends you were and how you love her.
Oh, Madam Mina, by that love, I implore you, help me.
It is for others' good that I ask, to redress great wrong,
and to lift much and terrible troubles, that may be more great
than you can know.  May it be that I see you?  You can trust me.
I am friend of Dr. John Seward and of Lord Godalming
(that was Arthur of Miss Lucy). I must keep it private for
the present from all.  I should come to Exeter to see you at once
if you tell me I am privilege to come, and where and when.
I implore your pardon, Madam.  I have read your letters to poor Lucy,
and know how good you are and how your husband suffer.
So I pray you, if it may be, enlighten him not, least it may harm.
Again your pardon, and forgive me.

""VAN HELSING""




TELEGRAM, MRS.  HARKER TO VAN HELSING


25 September.--Come today by quarter past ten train if you can catch it.
Can see you any time you call.  ""WILHELMINA HARKER""




MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


25 September.--I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time
draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect
that it will throw some light upon Jonathan's sad experience,
and as he attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can
tell me all about her.  That is the reason of his coming.
It is concerning Lucy and her sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan.
Then I shall never know the real truth now!  How silly I am.
That awful journal gets hold of my imagination and tinges
everything with something of its own color.  Of course it
is about Lucy.  That habit came back to the poor dear,
and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill.
I had almost forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards.
She must have told him of her sleep-walking adventure on
the cliff, and that I knew all about it, and now he wants
me to tell him what I know, so that he may understand.
I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs. Westenra.
I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it
even a negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy.
I hope too, Dr. Van Helsing will not blame me.
I have had so much trouble and anxiety of late that I feel I
cannot bear more just at present.

I suppose a cry does us all good at times, clears the air as
other rain does.  Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday
that upset me, and then Jonathan went away this morning to stay
away from me a whole day and night, the first time we have been
parted since our marriage.  I do hope the dear fellow will take
care of himself, and that nothing will occur to upset him.
It is two o'clock, and the doctor will be here soon now.
I shall say nothing of Jonathan's journal unless he asks me.
I am so glad I have typewritten out my own journal,
so that, in case he asks about Lucy, I can hand it to him.
It will save much questioning.

Later.--He has come and gone.  Oh, what a strange meeting,
and how it all makes my head whirl round.  I feel like one
in a dream.  Can it be all possible, or even a part of it?
If I had not read Jonathan's journal first, I should never
have accepted even a possibility.  Poor, poor, dear Jonathan!
How he must have suffered.  Please the good God, all this
may not upset him again.  I shall try to save him from it.
But it may be even a consolation and a help to him,
terrible though it be and awful in its consequences,
to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did
not deceive him, and that it is all true.  It may be that it
is the doubt which haunts him, that when the doubt is removed,
no matter which, waking or dreaming, may prove the truth,
he will be more satisfied and better able to bear the shock.
Dr. Van Helsing must be a good man as well as a clever one
if he is Arthur's friend and Dr. Seward's, and if they brought
him all the way from Holland to look after Lucy.  I feel from
having seen him that he is good and kind and of a noble nature.
When he comes tomorrow I shall ask him about Jonathan.  And then,
please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end.
I used to think I would like to practice interviewing.
Jonathan's friend on ""The Exeter News"" told him that memory
is everything in such work, that you must be able to put
down exactly almost every word spoken, even if you had to
refine some of it afterwards.  Here was a rare interview.
I shall try to record it verbatim.

It was half-past two o'clock when the knock came.
I took my courage a deux mains and waited.  In a few minutes
Mary opened the door, and announced ""Dr. Van Helsing"".

I rose and bowed, and he came towards me, a man of medium weight,
strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest
and a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck.
The poise of the head strikes me at once as indicative of thought and power.
The head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears.
The face, clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large resolute,
mobile mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick,
sensitive nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big bushy brows come down
and the mouth tightens.  The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first
almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart,
such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,
but falls naturally back and to the sides.  Big, dark blue eyes are set
widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man's moods.
He said to me,

""Mrs. Harker, is it not?""  I bowed assent.

""That was Miss Mina Murray?""  Again I assented.

""It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear child
Lucy Westenra.  Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead that I come.""

""Sir,"" I said, ""you could have no better claim on me than that you
were a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra.""And I held out my hand.
He took it and said tenderly,

""Oh, Madam Mina, I know that the friend of that poor little girl must be good,
but I had yet to learn.  . ."" He finished his speech with a courtly bow.
I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at once began.

""I have read your letters to Miss Lucy.  Forgive me, but I
had to begin to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask.
I know that you were with her at Whitby.  She sometimes
kept a diary, you need not look surprised, Madam Mina.
It was begun after you had left, and was an imitation of you,
and in that diary she traces by inference certain things
to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her.
In great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your
so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.""

""I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.""

""Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details?
It is not always so with young ladies.""

""No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time.
I can show it to you if you like.""

""Oh, Madam Mina, I well be grateful.  You will do me much favor.""

I could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit,
I suppose it is some taste of the original apple that remains
still in our mouths, so I handed him the shorthand diary.
He took it with a grateful bow, and said, ""May I read it?""

""If you wish,"" I answered as demurely as I could.
He opened it, and for an instant his face fell.
Then he stood up and bowed.

""Oh, you so clever woman!"" he said.  ""I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was
a man of much thankfulness, but see, his wife have all the good things.
And will you not so much honor me and so help me as to read it
for me?  Alas!  I know not the shorthand.""

By this time my little joke was over, and I was almost ashamed.
So I took the typewritten copy from my work basket and handed
it to him.

""Forgive me,"" I said.  ""I could not help it, but I had been
thinking that it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask,
and so that you might not have time to wait, not on my account,
but because I know your time must be precious, I have written
it out on the typewriter for you.""

He took it and his eyes glistened.  ""You are so good,"" he said.
""And may I read it now?  I may want to ask you some things
when I have read.""

""By all means,"" I said.  ""read it over whilst I order lunch,
and then you can ask me questions whilst we eat.""

He bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back to the light,
and became so absorbed in the papers, whilst I went to see
after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be disturbed.
When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up
and down the room, his face all ablaze with excitement.
He rushed up to me and took me by both hands.

""Oh, Madam Mina,"" he said, ""how can I say what I owe to you?  This paper
is as sunshine.  It opens the gate to me.  I am dazed, I am dazzled,
with so much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time.
But that you do not, cannot comprehend.  Oh, but I am grateful to you,
you so clever woman.  Madame,"" he said this very solemnly, ""if ever Abraham
Van Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.
It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend, as a friend,
but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you and
those you love.  There are darknesses in life, and there are lights.
You are one of the lights.  You will have a happy life and a good life,
and your husband will be blessed in you.""

""But, doctor, you praise me too much, and you do not know me.""

""Not know you, I, who am old, and who have studied all my
life men and women, I who have made my specialty the brain
and all that belongs to him and all that follow from him!
And I have read your diary that you have so goodly written for me,
and which breathes out truth in every line.  I, who have read
your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your marriage and your trust,
not know you!  Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell all their lives,
and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that angels
can read.  And we men who wish to know have in us something
of angels' eyes.  Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too,
for you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature.
And your husband, tell me of him.  Is he quite well?
Is all that fever gone, and is he strong and hearty?""

I saw here an opening to ask him about Jonathan, so I said,
""He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset
by Mr. Hawkins death.""

He interrupted, ""Oh, yes.  I know.  I know.  I have read
your last two letters.""

I went on, ""I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday
last he had a sort of shock.""

""A shock, and after brain fever so soon!  That is not good.
What kind of shock was it?""

""He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible,
something which led to his brain fever.""  And here the whole thing
seemed to overwhelm me in a rush.  The pity for Jonathan, the horror
which he experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear
that has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult.
I suppose I was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held
up my hands to him, and implored him to make my husband well again.
He took my hands and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa,
and sat by me.  He held my hand in his, and said to me with, oh,
such infinite sweetness,

""My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I
have not had much time for friendships, but since I have been
summoned to here by my friend John Seward I have known so many
good people and seen such nobility that I feel more than ever,
and it has grown with my advancing years, the loneliness of my life.
Believe me, then, that I come here full of respect for you,
and you have given me hope, hope, not in what I am seeking of,
but that there are good women still left to make life happy,
good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson
for the children that are to be.  I am glad, glad, that I
may here be of some use to you.  For if your husband suffer,
he suffer within the range of my study and experience.
I promise you that I will gladly do all for him that I can,
all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy one.
Now you must eat.  You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.
Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale,
and what he like not where he love, is not to his good.
Therefore for his sake you must eat and smile.  You have told me
about Lucy, and so now we shall not speak of it, lest it distress.
I shall stay in Exeter tonight, for I want to think much
over what you have told me, and when I have thought I will
ask you questions, if I may.  And then too, you will tell me
of husband Jonathan's trouble so far as you can, but not yet.
You must eat now, afterwards you shall tell me all.""

After lunch, when we went back to the drawing room, he said to me,
""And now tell me all about him.""

When it came to speaking to this great learned man, I began
to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and Jonathan a madman,
that journal is all so strange, and I hesitated to go on.
But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help,
and I trusted him, so I said,

""Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer
that you must not laugh at me or at my husband.
I have been since yesterday in a sort of fever of doubt.
You must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I have
even half believed some very strange things.""

He reassured me by his manner as well as his words when he said,
""Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter
regarding which I am here, it is you who would laugh.
I have learned not to think little of any one's belief, no matter
how strange it may be.  I have tried to keep an open mind,
and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close it,
but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things
that make one doubt if they be mad or sane.""

""Thank you, thank you a thousand times!  You have taken a weight off my mind.
If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read.  It is long,
but I have typewritten it out.  It will tell you my trouble and Jonathan's.
It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that happened.
I dare not say anything of it.  You will read for yourself and judge.
And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell me
what you think.""

""I promise,"" he said as I gave him the papers.  ""I shall in the morning,
as soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may.""

""Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come
to lunch with us and see him then.  You could catch the quick
3:34 train, which will leave you at Paddington before eight.""
He was surprised at my knowledge of the trains offhand, but he does
not know that I have made up all the trains to and from Exeter,
so that I may help Jonathan in case he is in a hurry.

So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here thinking,
thinking I don't know what.




LETTER (by hand), VAN HELSING TO MRS.  HARKER


25 September, 6 o'clock

""Dear Madam Mina,

""I have read your husband's so wonderful diary.  You may sleep without doubt.
Strange and terrible as it is, it is true!  I will pledge my life on it.
It may be worse for others, but for him and you there is no dread.
He is a noble fellow, and let me tell you from experience of men, that one
who would do as he did in going down that wall and to that room, aye,
and going a second time, is not one to be injured in permanence by a shock.
His brain and his heart are all right, this I swear, before I have even
seen him, so be at rest.  I shall have much to ask him of other things.
I am blessed that today I come to see you, for I have learn all at once
so much that again I am dazzled, dazzled more than ever, and I must think.

""Yours the most faithful,

""Abraham Van Helsing.""


LETTER, MRS.  HARKER TO VAN HELSING


25 September, 6:30 P.M.

""My dear Dr. Van Helsing,

""A thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken a great
weight off my mind.  And yet, if it be true, what terrible things
there are in the world, and what an awful thing if that man,
that monster, be really in London!  I fear to think.
I have this moment, whilst writing, had a wire from Jonathan,
saying that he leaves by the 6:25 tonight from Launceston and
will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fear tonight.
Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please come
to breakfast at eight o'clock, if this be not too early for you?
You can get away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train,
which will bring you to Paddington by 2:35. Do not answer this,
as I shall take it that, if I do not hear, you will
come to breakfast.

""Believe me,

""Your faithful and grateful friend,

""Mina Harker.""





JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


26 September.--I thought never to write in this diary again,
but the time has come.  When I got home last night Mina
had supper ready, and when we had supped she told me of Van
Helsing's visit, and of her having given him the two diaries
copied out, and of how anxious she has been about me.
She showed me in the doctor's letter that all I wrote down was true.
It seems to have made a new man of me.  It was the doubt
as to the reality of the whole thing that knocked me over.
I felt impotent, and in the dark, and distrustful.
But, now that I know, I am not afraid, even of the Count.
He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting
to London, and it was he I saw.  He has got younger, and how?
Van Helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is
anything like what Mina says.  We sat late, and talked it over.
Mina is dressing, and I shall call at the hotel in a few
minutes and bring him over.


He was, I think, surprised to see me.  When I came into the room whee he was,
and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my face round
to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny,

""But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock.""

It was so funny to hear my wife called `Madam Mina' by this kindly,
strong-faced old man.  I smiled, and said, ""I was ill, I have had a shock,
but you have cured me already.""

""And how?""

""By your letter to Mina last night.  I was in doubt, and then everything
took a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the evidence
of my own senses.  Not knowing what to trust, I did not know what to do,
and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been the groove
of my life.  The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted myself.
Doctor, you don't know what it is to doubt everything, even yourself.
No, you don't, you couldn't with eyebrows like yours.""

He seemed pleased, and laughed as he said, ""So!  You are a physiognomist.
I learn more here with each hour.  I am with so much pleasure coming
to you to breakfast, and, oh, sir, you will pardon praise from an old man,
but you are blessed in your wife.""

I would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply
nodded and stood silent.

""She is one of God's women, fashioned by His own hand
to show us men and other women that there is a heaven
where we can enter, and that its light can be here on earth.
So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an egoist, and that,
let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and selfish.
And you, sir.  . . I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,
and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days
from the knowing of others, but I have seen your true self
since last night.  You will give me your hand, will you not?
And let us be friends for all our lives.""

We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made
me quite choky.

""and now,"" he said, ""may I ask you for some more help?
I have a great task to do, and at the beginning it is to know.
You can help me here.  Can you tell me what went before
your going to Transylvania?  Later on I may ask more help,
and of a different kind, but at first this will do.""

""Look here, Sir,"" I said, ""does what you have to do concern the Count?""

""It does,"" he said solemnly.""

""Then I am with you heart and soul.  As you go by the 10:30 train,
you will not have time to read them, but I shall get the bundle of papers.
You can take them with you and read them in the train.""

After breakfast I saw him to the station.  When we were parting he said,
""Perhaps you will come to town if I send for you, and take Madam Mina too.""

""We shall both come when you will,"" I said.

I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the
previous night, and while we were talking at the carriage window,
waiting for the train to start, he was turning them over.
His eyes suddenly seemed to catch something in one of them,
""The Westminster Gazette"", I knew it by the color,
and he grew quite white.  He read something intently,
groaning to himself, ""Mein Gott!  Mein Gott!  So soon!
So soon!""  I do not think he remembered me at the moment.
Just then the whistle blew, and the train moved off.
This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of the window
and waved his hand, calling out, ""Love to Madam Mina.
I shall write so soon as ever I can.""




DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


26 September.--Truly there is no such thing as finality.
Not a week since I said ""Finis,"" and yet here I am
starting fresh again, or rather going on with the record.
Until this afternoon I had no cause to think of what is done.
Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as he ever was.
He was already well ahead with his fly business, and he had
just started in the spider line also, so he had not been of any
trouble to me.  I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday,
and from it I gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well.
Quincey Morris is with him, and that is much of a help,
for he himself is a bubbling well of good spirits.
Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that Arthur
is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy, so as
to them all my mind is at rest.  As for myself, I was settling
down to my work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it,
so that I might fairly have said that the wound which poor
Lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised.

Everything is, however, now reopened, and what is to be the end
God only knows.  I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows,
too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity.
He went to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night.
Today he came back, and almost bounded into the room at about
half-past five o'clock, and thrust last night's ""Westminster Gazette""
into my hand.

""What do you think of that?"" he asked as he stood back and folded his arms.

I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant,
but he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being
decoyed away at Hampstead.  It did not convey much to me, until I reached
a passage where it described small puncture wounds on their throats.
An idea struck me, and I looked up.

""Well?"" he said.

""It is like poor Lucy's.""

""And what do you make of it?""

""Simply that there is some cause in common.  Whatever it was that injured
her has injured them.""  I did not quite understand his answer.

""That is true indirectly, but not directly.""

""How do you mean, Professor?""  I asked.  I was a little inclined
to take his seriousness lightly, for, after all, four days
of rest and freedom from burning, harrowing, anxiety does help
to restore one's spirits, but when I saw his face, it sobered me.
Never, even in the midst of our despair about poor Lucy,
had he looked more stern.

""Tell me!""  I said.  ""I can hazard no opinion.  I do not know what to think,
and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.""

""Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion
as to what poor Lucy died of, not after all the hints given,
not only by events, but by me?""

""Of nervous prostration following a great loss or waste of blood.""

""And how was the blood lost or wasted?""  I shook my head.

He stepped over and sat down beside me, and went on, ""You are a clever man,
friend John.  You reason well, and your wit is bold, but you are
too prejudiced.  You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear,
and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to you.
Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand,
and yet which are, that some people see things that others cannot?
But there are things old and new which must not be contemplated by men's eyes,
because they know, or think they know, some things which other men have
told them.  Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all,
and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain.
But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs, which think
themselves new, and which are yet but the old, which pretend to be young,
like the fine ladies at the opera.  I suppose now you do not believe
in corporeal transference.  No?  Nor in materialization.  No?  Nor in
astral bodies.  No?  Nor in the reading of thought.  No?  Nor in hypnotism.
. .""

""Yes,"" I said.  ""Charcot has proved that pretty well.""

He smiled as he went on, ""Then you are satisfied as to it.  Yes?  And of
course then you understand how it act, and can follow the mind
of the great Charcot, alas that he is no more, into the very soul
of the patient that he influence.  No?  Then, friend John,
am I to take it that you simply accept fact, and are satisfied
to let from premise to conclusion be a blank?  No?  Then tell me,
for I am a student of the brain, how you accept hypnotism
and reject the thought reading.  Let me tell you, my friend,
that there are things done today in electrical science which would
have been deemed unholy by the very man who discovered electricity,
who would themselves not so long before been burned as wizards.
There are always mysteries in life.  Why was it that Methuselah
lived nine hundred years, and `Old Parr'one hundred and sixty-nine,
and yet that poor Lucy, with four men's blood in her poor veins,
could not live even one day?  For, had she live one more day,
we could save her.  Do you know all the mystery of life and death?
Do you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say
wherefore the qualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others?
Can you tell me why, when other spiders die small and soon,
that one great spider lived for centuries in the tower of the old
Spanish church and grew and grew, till, on descending, he could drink
the oil of all the church lamps?  Can you tell me why in the Pampas,
ay and elsewhere, there are bats that come out at night and open
the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their veins, how in some
islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang on the trees
all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods,
and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that it is hot,
flit down on them and then, and then in the morning are found dead men,
white as even Miss Lucy was?""

""Good God, Professor!""  I said, starting up.  ""Do you mean
to tell me that Lucy was bitten by such a bat, and that such
a thing is here in London in the nineteenth century?""

He waved his hand for silence, and went on, ""Can you tell me
why the tortoise lives more long than generations of men,
why the elephant goes on and on till he have sees dynasties,
and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat of dog
or other complaint?  Can you tell me why men believe in all
ages and places that there are men and women who cannot die?
We all know, because science has vouched for the fact, that there
have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of years, shut in one
so small hole that only hold him since the youth of the world.
Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die
and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it,
and the corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again,
and then men come and take away the unbroken seal and that there
lie the Indian fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk
amongst them as before?""

Here I interrupted him.  I was getting bewildered.
He so crowded on my mind his list of nature's eccentricities and
possible impossibilities that my imagination was getting fired.
I had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson,
as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam.
But he used them to tell me the thing, so that I could
have the object of thought in mind all the time.
But now I was without his help, yet I wanted to follow him,
so I said,

""Professor, let me be your pet student again.  Tell me
the thesis, so that I may apply your knowledge as you go on.
At present I am going in my mind from point to point
as a madman, and not a sane one, follows an idea.
I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a midst,
jumping from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort
to move on without knowing where I am going.""

""That is a good image,"" he said.  ""Well, I shall tell you.
My thesis is this, I want you to believe.""

""To believe what?""

""To believe in things that you cannot.  Let me illustrate.
I heard once of an American who so defined faith, `that faculty
which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue.'
For one, I follow that man.  He meant that we shall have an
open mind, and not let a little bit of truth check the rush
of the big truth, like a small rock does a railway truck.
We get the small truth first.  Good!  We keep him, and we
value him, but all the same we must not let him think himself
all the truth in the universe.""

""Then you want me not to let some previous conviction inure
the receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter.
Do I read your lesson aright?""

""Ah, you are my favorite pupil still.  It is worth to teach you.  Now that you
are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to understand.
You think then that those so small holes in the children's throats were made
by the same that made the holes in Miss Lucy?""

""I suppose so.""

He stood up and said solemnly, ""Then you are wrong.  Oh, would it were so!
But alas!  No. It is worse, far, far worse.""

""In God's name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?""  I cried.

He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair,
and placed his elbows on the table, covering his face with his
hands as he spoke.

""They were made by Miss Lucy!""




CHAPTER 15


DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY-cont.


For a while sheer anger mastered me.  It was as if he had during her life
struck Lucy on the face.  I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to him,
""Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?""

He raised his head and looked at me, and somehow the tenderness
of his face calmed me at once.  ""Would I were!"" he said.
""Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this.
Oh, my friend, whey, think you, did I go so far round,
why take so long to tell so simple a thing?
Was it because I hate you and have hated you all my life?
Was it because I wished to give you pain?  Was it that I wanted,
no so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life,
and from a fearful death?  Ah no!""

""Forgive me,"" said I.

He went on, ""My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in
the breaking to you, for I know you have loved that so sweet lady.
But even yet I do not expect you to believe.  It is so hard
to accept at once any abstract truth, that we may doubt such
to be possible when we have always believed the `no' of it.
It is more hard still to accept so sad a concrete truth,
and of such a one as Miss Lucy.  Tonight I go to prove it.
Dare you come with me?""

This staggered me.  A man does not like to prove such a truth,
Byron excepted from the catagory, jealousy.


""And prove the very truth he most abhorred.""


He saw my hesitation, and spoke, ""The logic is simple, no madman's
logic this time, jumping from tussock to tussock in a misty bog.
If it not be true, then proof will be relief.  At worst it will not harm.
If it be true!  Ah, there is the dread.  Yet every dread should help my cause,
for in it is some need of belief.  Come, I tell you what I propose.
First, that we go off now and see that child in the hospital.  Dr. Vincent,
of the North Hospital, where the papers say the child is, is a friend
of mine, and I think of yours since you were in class at Amsterdam.
He will let two scientists see his case, if he will not let two friends.
We shall tell him nothing, but only that we wish to learn.
And then.  . .""

""And then?""

He took a key from his pocket and held it up.  ""And then we
spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies.
This is the key that lock the tomb.  I had it from the coffin
man to give to Arthur.""

My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful
ordeal before us.  I could do nothing, however, so I plucked
up what heart I could and said that we had better hasten,
as the afternoon was passing.

We found the child awake.  It had had a sleep and taken some food,
and altogether was going on well.  Dr, Vincent took the bandage
from its throat, and showed us the punctures.  There was no
mistaking the similarity to those which had been on Lucy's throat.
They were smaller, and the edges looked fresher, that was all.
We asked Vincent to what he attributed them, and he replied
that it must have been a bite of some animal, perhaps a rat,
but for his own part, he was inclined to think it was one of
the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of London.
""Out of so many harmless ones,"" he said, ""there may be some
wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species.
Some sailor may have brought one home, and it managed
to escape, or even from the Zoological Gardens a young one
may have got loose, or one be bred there from a vampire.
These things do occur, you, know.  Only ten days ago a wolf
got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction.
For a week after, the children were playing nothing but Red
Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in the place until
this `bloofer lady' scare came along, since then it has been
quite a gala time with them.  Even this poor little mite,
when he woke up today, asked the nurse if he might go away.
When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted
to play with the `bloofer lady'.""

""I hope,"" said Van Helsing, ""that when you are sending the child
home you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it.
These fancies to stray are most dangerous, and if the child
were to remain out another night, it would probably be fatal.
But in any case I suppose you will not let it away for some days?""

""Certainly not, not for a week at least, longer if the wound
is not healed.""

Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had
reckoned on, and the sun had dipped before we came out.
When Van Helsing saw how dark it was, he said,

""There is not hurry.  It is more late than I thought.
Come, let us seek somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall
go on our way.""

We dined at `Jack Straw's Castle' along with a little crowd of bicyclists and
others who were genially noisy.  About ten o'clock we started from the inn.
It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when
we were once outside their individual radius.  The Professor had evidently
noted the road we were to go, for he went on unhesitatingly, but, as for me,
I was in quite a mixup as to locality.  As we went further, we met
fewer and fewer people, till at last we were somewhat surprised when we
met even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round.
At last we reached the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed over.
With some little difficulty, for it was very dark, and the whole place seemed
so strange to us, we found the Westenra tomb.  The Professor took the key,
opened the creaky door, and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously,
motioned me to precede him.  There was a delicious irony in the offer,
in the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion.
My companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to,
after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a
spring one.  In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight.
Then he fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,
proceeded to make a light.  The tomb in the daytime, and when wreathed
with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough, but now,
some days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites
turning to rust and their greens to browns, when the spider and the beetle
had resumed their accustomed dominance, when the time-discolored stone,
and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished brass,
and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle,
the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined.
It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life, animal life, was not the only
thing which could pass away.

Van Helsing went about his work systematically.  Holding his
candle so that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding
it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed
as they touched the metal, he made assurance of Lucy's coffin.
Another search in his bag, and he took out a turnscrew.

""What are you going to do?""  I asked.

""To open the coffin.  You shall yet be convinced.""

Straightway he began taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid,
showing the casing of lead beneath.  The sight was almost too much for me.
It seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been
to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living.
I actually took hold of his hand to stop him.

He only said, ""You shall see, ""and again fumbling in his bag took
out a tiny fret saw.  Striking the turnscrew through the lead with
a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he made a small hole,
which was, however, big enough to admit the point of the saw.
I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse.
We doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become
accustomed to such things, and I drew back towards the door.
But the Professor never stopped for a moment.  He sawed down a
couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin, and then across,
and down the other side.  Taking the edge of the loose flange,
he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin, and holding
up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to look.

I drew near and looked.  The coffin was empty.  It was certainly a surprise
to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but Van Helsing was unmoved.
He was now more sure than ever of his ground, and so emboldened to proceed
in his task.""Are you satisfied now, friend John?"" he asked.

I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as I
answered him, ""I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in that coffin,
but that only proves one thing.""

""And what is that, friend John?""

""That it is not there.""

""That is good logic,"" he said, ""so far as it goes.
But how do you, how can you, account for it not being there?""

""Perhaps a body-snatcher,"" I suggested.  ""Some of the undertaker's
people may have stolen it.""  I felt that I was speaking folly,
and yet it was the only real cause which I could suggest.

The Professor sighed.  ""Ah well!"" he said,"" we must have more proof.
Come with me.""

He put on the coffin lid again, gathered up all his things and placed them
in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the bag.
We opened the door, and went out.  Behind us he closed the door
and locked it.  He handed me the key, saying, ""Will you keep it?
You had better be assured.""

I laughed, it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am bound to say,
as I motioned him to keep it.  ""A key is nothing,"" I said,
""thee are many duplicates, and anyhow it is not difficult
to pick a lock of this kind.""

He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket.
Then he told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst
he would watch at the other.

I took up my place behind a yew tree, and I saw his dark figure move until
the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight.

It was a lonely vigil.  Just after I had taken my place I heard
a distant clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two.
I was chilled and unnerved, and angry with the Professor
for taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming.
I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant,
and not sleepy enough to betray my trust, so altogether I
had a dreary, miserable time.

Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a
white streak, moving between two dark yew trees at the side
of the churchyard farthest from the tomb.  At the same time
a dark mass moved from the Professor's side of the ground,
and hurriedly went towards it.  Then I too moved, but I had to go
round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I stumbled over graves.
The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an early cock crew.
A little ways off, beyond a line of scattered juniper trees,
which marked the pathway to the church, a white dim figure
flitted in the direction of the tomb.  The tomb itself was hidden
by trees, and I could not see where the figure had disappeared.
I heard the rustle of actual movement where I had first seen
the white figure, and coming over, found the Professor holding
in his arms a tiny child.  When he saw me he held it out to me,
and said, ""Are you satisfied now?""

""No,"" I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.

""Do you not see the child?""

""Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here?  And is it wounded?""

""We shall see,"" said the Professor, and with one impulse we took
our way out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.

When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump
of trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child's throat.
It was without a scratch or scar of any kind.

""Was I right?""  I asked triumphantly.

""We were just in time,"" said the Professor thankfully.

We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so
consulted about it.  If we were to take it to a police station we
should have to give some account of our movements during the night.
At least, we should have had to make some statement as to how we
had come to find the child.  So finally we decided that we would
take it to the Heath, and when we heard a policeman coming,
would leave it where he could not fail to find it.  We would then
seek our way home as quickly as we could.  All fell out well.
At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman's heavy tramp,
and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until
he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro.  We heard his
exclamation of astonishment, and then we went away silently.
By good chance we got a cab near the `Spainiards,' and drove to town.

I cannot sleep, so I make this entry.  But I must try to get
a few hours' sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon.
He insists that I go with him on another expedition.


27 September.--It was two o'clock before we found a suitable
opportunity for our attempt.  The funeral held at noon was
all completed, and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken
themselves lazily away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump
of alder trees, we saw the sexton lock the gate after him.
We knew that we were safe till morning did we desire it, but the
Professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most.
Again I felt that horrid sense of the reality of things, in which any
effort of imagination seemed out of place, and I realized distinctly
the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work.
Besides, I felt it was all so useless.  Outrageous as it was to open
a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead,
it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again, when we knew,
from the evidence of our own eyesight, that the coffin was empty.
I shrugged my shoulders, however, and rested silent, for Van Helsing
had a way of going on his own road, no matter who remonstrated.
He took the key, opened the vault, and again courteously motioned me
to precede.  The place was not so gruesome as last night, but oh,
how unutterably mean looking when the sunshine streamed in.
Van Helsing walked over to Lucy's coffin, and I followed.
He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange, and a shock
of surprise and dismay shot through me.

There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night
before her funeral.  She was, if possible, more radiantly
beautiful than ever, and I could not believe that she was dead.
The lips were red, nay redder than before, and on the cheeks
was a delicate bloom.

""Is this a juggle?""  I said to him.

""Are you convinced now?"" said the Professor, in response,
and as he spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made
me shudder, pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth.
""See,"" he went on, ""they are even sharper than before.
With this and this,"" and he touched one of the canine teeth
and that below it, ""the little children can be bitten.
Are you of belief now, friend John?""

Once more argumentative hostility woke within me.  I could not accept
such an overwhelming idea as he suggested.  So, with an attempt to argue
of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said, ""She may have been
placed here since last night.""

""Indeed?  That is so, and by whom?""

""I do not know.  Someone has done it.""

""And yet she has been dead one week.  Most peoples in that time would
not look so.""

I had no answer for this, so was silent.  Van Helsing did not seem to
notice my silence.  At any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor triumph.
He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising the eyelids and
looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and examining the teeth.
Then he turned to me and said,

""Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded.
Here is some dual life that is not as the common.  She was bitten
by the vampire when she was in a trance, sleep-walking, oh,
you start.  You do not know that, friend John, but you shall know
it later, and in trance could he best come to take more blood.
In trance she dies, and in trance she is UnDead, too.  So it
is that she differ from all other.  Usually when the UnDead
sleep at home,"" as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep
of his arm to designate what to a vampire was `home', ""their
face show what they are, but this so sweet that was when she
not UnDead she go back to the nothings of the common dead.
There is no malign there, see, and so it make hard that I must
kill her in her sleep.""

This turned my blood cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I
was accepting Van Helsing's theories.  But if she were really dead,
what was there of terror in the idea of killing her?

He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in my face,
for he said almost joyously, ""Ah, you believe now?""

I answered, ""Do not press me too hard all at once.  I am willing to accept.
How will you do this bloody work?""

""I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic,
and I shall drive a stake through her body.""

It made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman whom
I had loved.  And yet the feeling was not so strong as I had expected.
I was, in fact, beginning to shudder at the presence of this being,
this UnDead, as Van Helsing called it, and to loathe it.
Is it possible that love is all subjective, or all objective?

I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin,
but he stood as if wrapped in thought.  Presently he closed
the catch of his bag with a snap, and said,

""I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best.
If I did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment,
what is to be done.  But there are other things to follow, and things
that are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know.
This is simple.  She have yet no life taken, though that is of time,
and to act now would be to take danger from her forever.
But then we may have to want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this?
If you, who saw the wounds on Lucy's throat, and saw the wounds
so similar on the child's at the hospital, if you, who saw
the coffin empty last night and full today with a woman who have
not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week,
after she die, if you know of this and know of the white figure
last night that brought the child to the churchyard, and yet of your
own senses you did not believe, how then, can I expect Arthur,
who know none of those things, to believe?

""He doubted me when I took him from her kiss when she was dying.
I know he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea I
have done things that prevent him say goodbye as he ought,
and he may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman was
buried alive, and that in most mistake of all we have killed her.
He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that have
killed her by our ideas, and so he will be much unhappy always.
Yet he never can be sure, and that is the worst of all.
And he will sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive,
and that will paint his dreams with horrors of what she
must have suffered, and again, he will think that we
may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,
an UnDead.  No!  I told him once, and since then I learn much.
Now, since I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times
more do I know that he must pass through the bitter waters
to reach the sweet.  He, poor fellow, must have one hour
that will make the very face of heaven grow black to him,
then we can act for good all round and send him peace.
My mind is made up.  Let us go.  You return home for tonight
to your asylum, and see that all be well.  As for me,
I shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way.
Tomorrow night you will come to me to the Berkeley Hotel
at ten of the clock.  I shall send for Arthur to come too,
and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood.
Later we shall all have work to do.  I come with you so far
as Piccadilly and there dine, for I must be back here before
the sun set.""

So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the churchyard,
which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.




NOTE LEFT BY VAN HELSING IN HIS PORTMANTEAU, BERKELEY HOTEL DIRECTED TO
JOHN SEWARD, M. D. (Not Delivered)


27 September

""Friend John,

""I write this in case anything should happen.  I go alone to watch
in that churchyard.  It pleases me that the UnDead, Miss Lucy,
shall not leave tonight, that so on the morrow night she may be
more eager.  Therefore I shall fix some things she like not,
garlic and a crucifix, and so seal up the door of the tomb.
She is young as UnDead, and will heed.  Moreover, these are
only to prevent her coming out.  They may not prevail on her
wanting to get in, for then the UnDead is desperate, and must
find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may be.
I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after sunrise,
and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it.
For Miss Lucy or from her, I have no fear, but that other
to whom is there that she is UnDead, he have not the power
to seek her tomb and find shelter.  He is cunning, as I know
from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all along he have
fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy's life,
and we lost, and in many ways the UnDead are strong.
He have always the strength in his hand of twenty men, even we
four who gave our strength to Miss Lucy it also is all to him.
Besides, he can summon his wolf and I know not what.
So if it be that he came thither on this night he shall find me.
But none other shall, until it be too late.  But it may be that
he will not attempt the place.  There is no reason why he should.
His hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard
where the UnDead woman sleeps, and the one old man watch.

""Therefore I write this in case.  . .Take the papers that are with this,
the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this
great UnDead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake
through it, so that the world may rest from him.

""If it be so, farewell.

""VAN HELSING.""




DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


28 September.--It is wonderful what a good night's sleep will do for one.
Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing's monstrous ideas,
but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages
on common sense.  I have no doubt that he believes it all.
I wonder if his mind can have become in any way unhinged.  Surely there
must be some rational explanation of all these mysterious things.
Is it possible that the Professor can have done it himself?
He is so abnormally clever that if he went off his head he would carry
out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way.
I am loathe to think it, and indeed it would be almost as great
a marvel as the other to find that Van Helsing was mad, but anyhow
I shall watch him carefully.  I may get some light on the mystery.


29 September.--Last night, at a little before ten o'clock,
Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing's room.
He told us all what he wanted us to do, but especially addressing
himself to Arthur, as if all our wills were centered in his.
He began by saying that he hoped we would all come with him too,
""for,"" he said, ""there is a grave duty to be done there.
You were doubtless surprised at my letter?""  This query was
directly addressed to Lord Godalming.

""I was.  It rather upset me for a bit.  There has been so much
trouble around my house of late that I could do without any more.
I have been curious, too, as to what you mean.

""Quincey and I talked it over, but the more we talked,
the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself that I'm
about up a tree as to any meaning about anything.""

""Me too,"" said Quincey Morris laconically.

""Oh,"" said the Professor, ""then you are nearer the beginning,
both of you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way
back before he can even get so far as to begin.""

It was evident that he recognized my return to my old doubting frame
of mind without my saying a word.  Then, turning to the other two,
he said with intense gravity,

""I want your permission to do what I think good this night.
It is, I know, much to ask, and when you know what it is I
propose to do you will know, and only then how much.
Therefore may I ask that you promise me in the dark,
so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a time,
I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may be,
you shall not blame yourselves for anything.""

""That's frank anyhow,"" broke in Quincey.  ""I'll answer for the Professor.
I don't quite see his drift, but I swear he's honest, and that's good
enough for me.""

""I thank you, Sir,"" said Van Helsing proudly.  ""I have done myself the honor
of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear to me.""
He held out a hand, which Quincey took.

Then Arthur spoke out, ""Dr. Van Helsing, I don't quite like
to `buy a pig in a poke', as they say in Scotland, and if it
be anything in which my honour as a gentleman or my faith
as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.
If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate
either of these two, then I give my consent at once, though for
the life of me, I cannot understand what you are driving at.""

""I accept your limitation,"" said Van Helsing, ""and all I ask of you
is that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine,
you will first consider it well and be satisfied that it does not
violate your reservations.""

""Agreed!"" said Arthur.  ""That is only fair.  And now that the pourparlers
are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?""

""I want you to come with me, and to come in secret,
to the churchyard at Kingstead.""

Arthur's face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way,

""Where poor Lucy is buried?""

The Professor bowed.

Arthur went on, ""And when there?""

""To enter the tomb!""

Arthur stood up.  ""Professor, are you in earnest, or is it some
monstrous joke?  Pardon me, I see that you are in earnest.""
He sat down again, but I could see that he sat firmly and proudly,
as one who is on his dignity.  There was silence until he asked again,
""And when in the tomb?""

""To open the coffin.""

""This is too much!"" he said, angrily rising again.
""I am willing to be patient in all things that are reasonable,
but in this, this desecration of the grave, of one who.
. ."" He fairly choked with indignation.

The Professor looked pityingly at him.""If I could spare you
one pang, my poor friend,"" he said, ""God knows I would.
But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths, or later,
and for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!""

Arthur looked up with set white face and said, ""Take care, sir, take care!""

""Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?"" said Van Helsing.
""And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose.
Shall I go on?""

""That's fair enough,"" broke in Morris.

After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort, ""Miss Lucy
is dead, is it not so?  Yes!  Then there can be no wrong to her.
But if she be not dead.  . .""

Arthur jumped to his feet, ""Good God!"" he cried.  ""What do you mean?
Has there been any mistake, has she been buried alive?""
He groaned in anguish that not even hope could soften.

""I did not say she was alive, my child.  I did not think it.
I go no further than to say that she might be UnDead.""

""UnDead!  Not alive!  What do you mean?  Is this all a nightmare,
or what is it?""

""There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they
may solve only in part.  Believe me, we are now on the verge of one.
But I have not done.  May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?""

""Heavens and earth, no!"" cried Arthur in a storm of passion.
""Not for the wide world will I consent to any mutilation
of her dead body.  Dr. Van Helsing, you try me too far.
What have I done to you that you should torture me so?
What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to cast such
dishonor on her grave?  Are you mad, that you speak of such things,
or am I mad to listen to them?  Don't dare think more of such
a desecration.  I shall not give my consent to anything you do.
I have a duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage,
and by God, I shall do it!""

Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and said,
gravely and sternly, ""My Lord Godalming, I too, have a duty to do, a duty
to others, a duty to you, a duty to the dead, and by God, I shall do it!
All I ask you now is that you come with me, that you look and listen,
and if when later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its
fulfillment even than I am, then, I shall do my duty, whatever it may seem
to me.  And then, to follow your Lordship's wishes I shall hold myself
at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where you will.""
His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of pity.

""But I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me.  In a long life
of acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes
did wring my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now.
Believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind
towards me, one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour,
for I would do what a man can to save you from sorrow.  Just think.
For why should I give myself so much labor and so much of sorrow?
I have come here from my own land to do what I can of good, at the
first to please my friend John, and then to help a sweet young lady,
whom too, I come to love.  For her, I am ashamed to say so much,
but I say it in kindness, I gave what you gave, the blood of my veins.
I gave it, I who was not, like you, her lover, but only her
physician and her friend.  I gave her my nights and days,
before death, after death, and if my death can do her good even now,
when she is the dead UnDead, she shall have it freely.""
He said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much
affected by it.

He took the old man's hand and said in a broken voice,
""Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand,
but at least I shall go with you and wait.""





CHAPTER 16


DR SEWARD'S DIARY-cont.


It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got into the churchyard
over the low wall.  The night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight
between the dents of the heavy clouds that scudded across the sky.
We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly in front as
he led the way.  When we had come close to the tomb I looked well at Arthur,
for I feared the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory
would upset him, but he bore himself well.  I took it that the very
mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant to his grief.
The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural hesitation amongst
us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by entering first himself.
The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.  He then lit a dark
lantern and pointed to a coffin.  Arthur stepped forward hesitatingly.
Van Helsing said to me, ""You were with me here yesterday.
Was the body of Miss Lucy in that coffin?""

""It was.""

The Professor turned to the rest saying, ""You hear, and yet there
is no one who does not believe with me.'

He took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin.
Arthur looked on, very pale but silent.  When the lid was removed
he stepped forward.  He evidently did not know that there
was a leaden coffin, or at any rate, had not thought of it.
When he saw the rent in the lead, the blood rushed to his
face for an instant, but as quickly fell away again, so that
he remained of a ghastly whiteness.  He was still silent.
Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked
in and recoiled.

The coffin was empty!

For several minutes no one spoke a word.  The silence was
broken by Quincey Morris, ""Professor, I answered for you.
Your word is all I want.  I wouldn't ask such a thing ordinarily,
I wouldn't so dishonor you as to imply a doubt, but this
is a mystery that goes beyond any honor or dishonor.
Is this your doing?""

""I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have
not removed or touched her.  What happened was this.
Two nights ago my friend Seward and I came here,
with good purpose, believe me.  I opened that coffin,
which was then sealed up, and we found it as now, empty.
We then waited, and saw something white come through the trees.
The next day we came here in daytime and she lay there.
Did she not, friend John?

""Yes.""

""That night we were just in time.  One more so small child
was missing, and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves.
Yesterday I came here before sundown, for at sundown the UnDead can move.
I waited here all night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing.
It was most probable that it was because I had laid over
the clamps of those doors garlic, which the UnDead cannot bear,
and other things which they shun.  Last night there was no exodus,
so tonight before the sundown I took away my garlic and other things.
And so it is we find this coffin empty.  But bear with me.
So far there is much that is strange.  Wait you with me outside,
unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.
So,"" here he shut the dark slide of his lantern, ""now to the outside.""
He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking
the door behind him.

Oh!  But it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after
the terror of that vault.  How sweet it was to see the clouds
race by, and the passing gleams of the moonlight between
the scudding clouds crossing and passing, like the gladness
and sorrow of a man's life.  How sweet it was to breathe
the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay.
How humanizing to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill,
and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life
of a great city.  Each in his own way was solemn and overcome.
Arthur was silent, and was, I could see, striving to grasp
the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery.
I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again
to throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing's conclusions.
Quincey Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts
all things, and accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery,
with hazard of all he has at stake.  Not being able to smoke,
he cut himself a good-sized plug of tobacco and began to chew.
As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a definite way.
First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin,
wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin.
Next he took out a double handful of some whitish stuff,
like dough or putty.  He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked
it into the mass between his hands.  This he then took,
and rolling it into thin strips, began to lay them into
the crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb.
I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close, asked him what it
was that he was doing.  Arthur and Quincey drew near also,
as they too were curious.

He answered, ""I am closing the tomb so that the UnDead may not enter.""

""And is that stuff you have there going to do it?""

""It Is.""

""What is that which you are using?""  This time the question was by Arthur.
Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered.

""The Host.  I brought it from Amsterdam.  I have an Indulgence.""

It was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us,
and we felt individually that in the presence of such earnest
purpose as the Professor's, a purpose which could thus use
the to him most sacred of things, it was impossible to distrust.
In respectful silence we took the places assigned to us
close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any
one approaching.  I pitied the others, especially Arthur.
I had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this
watching horror, and yet I, who had up to an hour ago
repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink within me.
Never did tombs look so ghastly white.  Never did cypress,
or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funeral gloom.
Never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously.
Never did bough creak so mysteriously, and never did the far-away
howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night.

There was a long spell of silence, big, aching, void, and then
from the Professor a keen ""S-s-s-s!"" He pointed, and far
down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure advance,
a dim white figure, which held something dark at its breast.
The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell
upon the masses of driving clouds, and showed in startling
prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements
of the grave.  We could not see the face, for it was
bent down over what we saw to be a fair-haired child.
There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a child gives
in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams.
We were starting forward, but the Professor's warning hand,
seen by us as he stood behind a yew tree, kept us back.
And then as we looked the white figure moved forwards again.
It was now near enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight
still held.  My own heart grew cold as ice, and I could
hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognized the features
of Lucy Westenra.  Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed.
The sweetness was turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty,
and the purity to voluptuous wantonness.

Van Helsing stepped out, and obedient to his gesture, we all advanced too.
The four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb.  Van Helsing
raised his lantern and drew the slide.  By the concentrated light that fell
on Lucy's face we could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood,
and that the stream had trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her
lawn death robe.

We shuddered with horror.  I could see by the tremulous
light that even Van Helsing's iron nerve had failed.
Arthur was next to me, and if I had not seized his arm and held
him up, he would have fallen.

When Lucy, I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it
bore her shape, saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as
a cat gives when taken unawares, then her eyes ranged over us.
Lucy's eyes in form and color, but Lucy's eyes unclean and full
of hell fire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew.
At that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing.
Had she then to be killed, I could have done it with savage delight.
As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face
became wreathed with a voluptuous smile.  Oh, God, how it made me
shudder to see it!  With a careless motion, she flung to the ground,
callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had clutched strenuously
to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls over a bone.
The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning.  There was
a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur.
When she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile
he fell back and hid his face in his hands.

She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,
said, ""Come to me, Arthur.  Leave these others and come to me.
My arms are hungry for you.  Come, and we can rest together.
Come, my husband, come!""

There was something diabolically sweet in her tones, something of the tinkling
of glass when struck, which rang through the brains even of us who heard
the words addressed to another.

As for Arthur, he seemed under a spell, moving his hands from his face,
he opened wide his arms.  She was leaping for them, when Van Helsing
sprang forward and held between them his little golden crucifix.
She recoiled from it, and, with a suddenly distorted face, full of rage,
dashed past him as if to enter the tomb.

When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped,
as if arrested by some irresistible force.  Then she turned,
and her face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by
the lamp, which had now no quiver from Van Helsing's nerves.
Never did I see such baffled malice on a face, and never,
I trust, shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes.
The beautiful color became livid, the eyes seemed to throw
out sparks of hell fire, the brows were wrinkled as though
the folds of flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes,
and the lovely, blood-stained mouth grew to an open square,
as in the passion masks of the Greeks and Japanese.
If ever a face meant death, if looks could kill, we saw it
at that moment.

And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity,
se remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing
of her means of entry.

Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur, ""Answer me, oh my friend!
Am I to proceed in my work?""

""Do as you will, friend.  Do as you will.  There can be no horror
like this ever any more.""  And he groaned in spirit.

Quincey and I simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms.
We could hear the click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing
held it down.  Coming close to the tomb, he began to remove from
the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there.
We all looked on with horrified amazement as we saw, when he stood back,
the woman, with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own,
pass through the interstice where scarce a knife blade could have gone.
We all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor calmly
restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door.

When this was done, he lifted the child and said, ""Come now, my friends.
We can do no more till tomorrow.  There is a funeral at noon, so here we
shall all come before long after that.  The friends of the dead will all
be gone by two, and when the sexton locks the gate we shall remain.
Then there is more to do, but not like this of tonight.  As for this
little one, he is not much harmed, and by tomorrow night he shall be well.
We shall leave him where the police will find him, as on the other night,
and then to home.""

Coming close to Arthur, he said, ""My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial,
but after, when you look back, you will see how it was necessary.
You are now in the bitter waters, my child.  By this time tomorrow you will,
please God, have passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters.
So do not mourn over-much. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.""

Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other
on the way.  We had left behind the child in safety, and were tired.
So we all slept with more or less reality of sleep.


29 September, night.--A little before twelve o'clock we three,
Arthur, Quincey Morris, and myself, called for the Professor.
It was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put
on black clothes.  Of course, Arthur wore black, for he was
in deep mourning, but the rest of us wore it by instinct.
We got to the graveyard by half-past one, and strolled about,
keeping out of official observation, so that when the gravediggers
had completed their task and the sexton under the belief
that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place
all to ourselves.  Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag,
had with him a long leather one, something like a cricketing bag.
It was manifestly of fair weight.

When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps
die out up the road, we silently, and as if by
ordered intention, followed the Professor to the tomb.
He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it behind us.
Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also
two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck by melting
their own ends, on other coffins, so that they might give
light sufficient to work by.  When he again lifted the lid off
Lucy's coffin we all looked, Arthur trembling like an aspen,
and saw that the corpse lay there in all its death beauty.
But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but loathing
for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy's shape without her soul.
I could see even Arthur's face grow hard as he looked.
Presently he said to Van Helsing, ""Is this really Lucy's body,
or only a demon in her shape?""

""It is her body, and yet not it.  But wait a while, and you shall
see her as she was, and is.""

She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there,
the pointed teeth, the blood stained, voluptuous mouth, which made
one shudder to see, the whole carnal and unspirited appearance,
seeming like a devilish mockery of Lucy's sweet purity.
Van Helsing, with his usual methodicalness, began taking
the various contents from his bag and placing them ready for use.
First he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder,
and then small oil lamp, which gave out, when lit in a corner
of the tomb, gas which burned at a fierce heat with a blue flame,
then his operating knives, which he placed to hand, and last
a round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches
thick and about three feet long.  One end of it was hardened
by charring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point.
With this stake came a heavy hammer, such as in households
is used in the coal cellar for breaking the lumps.  To me,
a doctor's preperations for work of any kind are stimulating
and bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur
and Quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation.
They both, however, kept their courage, and remained
silent and quiet.

When all was ready, Van Helsing said, ""Before we do anything, let me
tell you this.  It is out of the lore and experience of the ancients
and of all those who have studied the powers of the UnDead.
When they become such, there comes with the change the curse
of immortality.  They cannot die, but must go on age after age
adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world.
For all that die from the preying of the Undead become themselves Undead,
and prey on their kind.  And so the circle goes on ever widening,
like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water.
Friend Arthur, if you had met that kiss which you know of before
poor Lucy die, or again, last night when you open your arms to her,
you would in time, when you had died, have become nosferatu,
as they call it in Eastern europe, and would for all time make
more of those Un-Deads that so have filled us with horror.
The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun.
Those children whose blood she sucked are not as yet so much the worse,
but if she lives on, UnDead, more and more they lose their blood and
by her power over them they come to her, and so she draw their blood
with that so wicked mouth.  But if she die in truth, then all cease.
The tiny wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back
to their play unknowing ever of what has been.  But of the most
blessed of all, when this now UnDead be made to rest as true dead,
then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free.
Instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased
in the assimilating of it by day, she shall take her place
with the other Angels.  So that, my friend, it will be a blessed
hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.
To this I am willing, but is there none amongst us who has a better right?
Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night
when sleep is not, `It was my hand that sent her to the stars.
It was the hand of him that loved her best, the hand that of all
she would herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?'
Tell me if there be such a one amongst us?""

We all looked at Arthur.  He saw too, what we all did,
the infinite kindness which suggested that his should be
the hand which would restore Lucy to us as a holy, and not
an unholy, memory.  He stepped forward and said bravely,
though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as snow,
""My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you.
Tell me what I am to do, and I shall not falter!""

Van Helsing laid a hand on his shoulder, and said, ""Brave lad!
A moment's courage, and it is done.  This stake must be driven through her.
It well be a fearful ordeal, be not deceived in that, but it will be only
a short time, and you will then rejoice more than your pain was great.
From this grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air.
But you must not falter when once you have begun.  Only think that we,
your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for you all the time.""

""Go on,"" said Arthur hoarsely.""Tell me what I am to do.""

""Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place to
the point over the heart, and the hammer in your right.
Then when we begin our prayer for the dead, I shall read him,
I have here the book, and the others shall follow, strike in
God's name, that so all may be well with the dead that we love
and that the UnDead pass away.""

Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind
was set on action his hands never trembled nor even quivered.
Van Helsing opened his missal and began to read, and Quincey
and I followed as well as we could.

Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could see its dint
in the white flesh.  Then he struck with all his might.

The thing in the coffin writhed, and a hideous,
blood-curdling screech came from the opened red lips.
The body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions.
The sharp white champed together till the lips were cut, and the mouth
was smeared with a crimson foam.  But Arthur never faltered.
He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell,
driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst the blood
from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it.
His face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it.
The sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed
to ring through the little vault.

And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less,
and the teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver.
Finally it lay still.  The terrible task was over.

The hammer fell from Arthur's hand.  He reeled and would
have fallen had we not caught him.  The great drops of sweat
sprang from his forehead, and his breath came in broken gasps.
It had indeed been an awful strain on him, and had he not been
forced to his task by more than human considerations he could
never have gone through with it.  For a few minutes we were
so taken up with him that we did not look towards the coffin.
When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from
one to the other of us.  We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose,
for he had been seated on the ground, and came and looked too,
and then a glad strange light broke over his face and dispelled
altogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it.

There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we has so dreaded
and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a privilege
to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in life,
with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity.  True that there were there,
as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and pain and waste.
But these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth to what we knew.
One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted
face and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was
to reign for ever.

Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur's shoulder, and said to him,
""And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?""

The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man's hand
in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said, ""Forgiven!
God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again, and me peace.""
He put his hands on the Professor's shoulder, and laying his head on
his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood unmoving.

When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him, ""And now,
my child, you may kiss her.  Kiss her dead lips if you will,
as she would have you to, if for her to choose.
For she is not a grinning devil now, not any more a foul Thing
for all eternity.  No longer she is the devil's UnDead.
She is God's true dead, whose soul is with Him!""

Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the tomb.
The Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point of it
in the body.  Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with garlic.
We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin lid, and gathering
up our belongings, came away.  When the Professor locked the door he gave
the key to Arthur.

Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang,
and it seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch.
There was gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we
were at rest ourselves on one account, and we were glad,
though it was with a tempered joy.

Before we moved away Van Helsing said, ""Now, my friends,
one step or our work is done, one the most harrowing to ourselves.
But there remains a greater task, to find out the author
of all this or sorrow and to stamp him out.  I have clues
which we can follow, but it is a long task, and a difficult one,
and there is danger in it, and pain.  Shall you not all help me?
We have learned to believe, all of us, is it not so?
And since so, do we not see our duty?  Yes!  And do we not
promise to go on to the bitter end?""

Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made.
Then said the Professor as we moved off, ""Two nights hence you
shall meet with me and dine together at seven of the clock
with friend John.  I shall entreat two others, two that you
know not as yet, and I shall be ready to all our work show
and our plans unfold.  Friend John, you come with me home,
for I have much to consult you about, and you can help me.
Tonight I leave for Amsterdam, but shall return tomorrow night.
And then begins our great quest.  But first I shall have
much to say, so that you may know what to do and to dread.
Then our promise shall be made to each other anew.
For there is a terrible task before us, and once our feet
are on the ploughshare we must not draw back.""





CHAPTER 17


DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY-cont.


When we arrived at the Berkely Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram
waiting for him.

""Am coming up by train.  Jonathan at Whitby.  Important news.
Mina Harker.""


The Professor was delighted.  ""Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina,""
he said, ""pearl among women!  She arrive, but I cannot stay.
She must go to your house, friend John.  You must meet her at the station.
Telegraph her en route so that she may be prepared.""

When the wire was dispatched he had a cup of tea.
Over it he told me of a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad,
and gave me a typewritten copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker's
diary at Whitby.  ""Take these,"" he said, ""and study them well.
When I have returned you will be master of all the facts,
and we can then better enter on our inquisition.
Keep them safe, for there is in them much of treasure.
You will need all your faith, even you who have had such an
experience as that of today.  What is here told,"" he laid his
hand heavily and gravely on the packet of papers as he spoke,
""may be the beginning of the end to you and me and many another,
or it may sound the knell of the UnDead who walk the earth.
Read all, I pray you, with the open mind, and if you can add
in any way to the story here told do so, for it is all important.
You have kept a diary of all these so strange things, is it
not so?  Yes!  Then we shall go through all these together
when we meet.""  He then made ready for his departure and shortly
drove off to Liverpool Street.  I took my way to Paddington,
where I arrived about fifteen minutes before the train came in.

The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common
to arrival platforms, and I was beginning to feel uneasy,
lest I might miss my guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty
looking girl stepped up to me, and after a quick glance said,
""Dr. Seward, is it not?""

""And you are Mrs. Harker!""  I answered at once, whereupon she held
out her hand.

""I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy, but.
. ."" She stopped suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.

The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease,
for it was a tacit answer to her own.  I got her luggage, which included
a typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street,
after I had sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting room
and a bedroom prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.

In due time we arrived.  She knew, of course, that the place
was a lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable
to repress a shudder when we entered.

She told me that, if she might, she would come presently
to my study, as she had much to say.  So here I am finishing
my entry in my phonograph diary whilst I await her.
As yet I have not had the chance of looking at the papers
which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before me.
I must get her interested in something, so that I may
have an opportunity of reading them.  She does not know
how precious time is, or what a task we have in hand.
I must be careful not to frighten her.  Here she is!




MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL

29 September.--After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward's study.
At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking with
some one.  As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at the door,
and on his calling out, ""Come in,"" I entered.

To my intense surprise, there was no one with him.
He was quite alone, and on the table opposite him was what I
knew at once from the description to be a phonograph.
I had never seen one, and was much interested.

""I hope I did not keep you waiting,"" I said, ""but I stayed at the door
as I heard you talking, and thought there was someone with you.""

""Oh,"" he replied with a smile, ""I was only entering my diary.""

""Your diary?""  I asked him in surprise.

""Yes,"" he answered.  ""I keep it in this.""  As he spoke
he laid his hand on the phonograph.  I felt quite excited
over it, and blurted out, ""Why, this beats even shorthand!
May I hear it say something?""

""Certainly,"" he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it
in train for speaking.  Then he paused, and a troubled look
overspread his face.

""The fact is,"" he began awkwardly.""I only keep my diary in it, and as it is
entirely, almost entirely, about my cases it may be awkward, that is, I mean.
. ."" He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his embarrassment.

""You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end.  Let me hear how
she died, for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful.
She was very, very dear to me.""

To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face,
""Tell you of her death?  Not for the wide world!""

""Why not?""  I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.

Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.
At length, he stammered out, ""You see, I do not know how to pick out
any particular part of the diary.""

Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him,
and he said with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice,
and with the naivete of a child, ""that's quite true,
upon my honor.  Honest Indian!""

I could not but smile, at which he grimaced.""I gave myself
away that time!"" he said.  ""But do you know that, although I
have kept the diary for months past, it never once struck me
how I was going to find any particular part of it in case I
wanted to look it up?""

By this time my mind was made up that the diary of a doctor
who attended Lucy might have something to add to the sum
of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and I said boldly,
""Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you
on my typewriter.""

He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said, ""No!  No!  No!  For all
the world.  I wouldn't let you know that terrible story.!""

Then it was terrible.  My intuition was right!  For a moment,
I thought, and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking
for something or some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great
batch of typewriting on the table.  His eyes caught the look
in mine, and without his thinking, followed their direction.
As they saw the parcel he realized my meaning.

""You do not know me,"" I said.  ""When you have read those papers, my own
diary and my husband's also, which I have typed, you will know me better.
I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in this cause.
But, of course, you do not know me, yet, and I must not expect you to trust
me so far.""

He is certainly a man of noble nature.  Poor dear Lucy was right about him.
He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in order
a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and said,

""You are quite right.  I did not trust you because I did not
know you.  But I know you now, and let me say that I should
have known you long ago.  I know that Lucy told you of me.
She told me of you too.  May I make the only atonement in my power?
Take the cylinders and hear them.  The first half-dozen
of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify you.
Then you will know me better.  Dinner will by then be ready.
In the meantime I shall read over some of these documents,
and shall be better able to understand certain things.""

He carried the phonograph himself up to my sitting room and adjusted
it for me.  Now I shall learn something pleasant, I am sure.
For it will tell me the other side of a true love episode of which I
know one side already.




DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


29 September.--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of
Jonathan Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time
run on without thinking.  Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid
came to announce dinner, so I said, ""She is possibly tired.
Let dinner wait an hour,"" and I went on with my work.
I had just finished Mrs. Harker's diary, when she came in.
She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes
were flushed with crying.  This somehow moved me much.
Of late I have had cause for tears, God knows!  But the relief
of them was denied me, and now the sight of those sweet eyes,
brightened by recent tears, went straight to my heart.
So I said as gently as I could, ""I greatly fear I
have distressed you.""

""Oh, no, not distressed me,"" she replied.  ""But I
have been more touched than I can say by your grief.
That is a wonderful machine, but it is cruelly true.
It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.
It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God.  No one must
hear them spoken ever again!  See, I have tried to be useful.
I have copied out the words on my typewriter, and none other
need now hear your heart beat, as I did.""

""No one need ever know, shall ever know,"" I said in a low voice.
She laid her hand on mine and said very gravely, ""Ah, but they must!""

""Must! but why?""  I asked.

""Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor Lucy's
death and all that led to it.  Because in the struggle which we
have before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we
must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get.
I think that the cylinders which you gave me contained more than you
intended me to know.  But I can see that there are in your record
many lights to this dark mystery.  You will let me help, will you not?
I know all up to a certain point, and I see already, though your
diary only took me to 7 September, how poor Lucy was beset,
and how her terrible doom was being wrought out.  Jonathan and I
have been working day and night since Professor Van Helsing saw us.
He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he will be
here tomorrow to help us.  We need have no secrets amongst us.
Working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger
than if some of us were in the dark.""

She looked at me so appealingly, and at the same time manifested
such courage and resolution in her bearing, that I gave in at once
to her wishes.  ""You shall,"" I said, ""do as you like in the matter.
God forgive me if I do wrong!  There are terrible things yet to learn of.
But if you have so far traveled on the road to poor Lucy's death,
you will not be content, I know, to remain in the dark.  Nay, the end,
the very end, may give you a gleam of peace.  Come, there is dinner.
We must keep one another strong for what is before us.  We have a cruel
and dreadful task.  When you have eaten you shall learn the rest,
and I shall answer any questions you ask, if there be anything which you
do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were present.""

MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


29 September.--After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study.
He brought back the phonograph from my room, and I took a chair,
and arranged the phonograph so that I could touch it without getting up,
and showed me how to stop it in case I should want to pause.
Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his back to me,
so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read.
I put the forked metal to my ears and listened.

When the terrible story of Lucy's death, and all that followed,
was done, I lay back in my chair powerless.  Fortunately I am
not of a fainting disposition.  When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped
up with a horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case
bottle from the cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few
minutes somewhat restored me.  My brain was all in a whirl,
and only that there came through all the multitude of horrors,
the holy ray of light that my dear Lucy was at last at peace,
I do not think I could have borne it without making a scene.
It is all so wild and mysterious, and strange that if I
had not known Jonathan's experience in Transylvania I could
not have believed.  As it was, I didn't know what to believe,
and so got out of my difficulty by attending to something else.
I took the cover off my typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward,

""Let me write this all out now.  We must be ready for Dr. Van
Helsing when he comes.  I have sent a telegram to Jonathan
to come on here when he arrives in London from Whitby.
In this matter dates are everything, and I think that if we
get all of our material ready, and have every item put
in chronological order, we shall have done much.

""You tell me that Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too.
Let us be able to tell them when they come.""

He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I began to typewrite
from the beginning of the seventeenth cylinder.  I used manifold,
and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with the rest.
It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about his work of going
his round of the patients.  When he had finished he came back and sat
near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely whilst I worked.
How good and thoughtful he is.  The world seems full of good men,
even if there are monsters in it.

Before I left him I remembered what Jonathan put in his diary
of the Professor's perturbation at reading something in an evening
paper at the station at Exeter, so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps
his newspapers, I borrowed the files of `The Westminster Gazette'
and `The Pall Mall Gazette' and took them to my room.
I remember how much the `Dailygraph' and `The Whitby Gazette',
of which I had made cuttings, had helped us to understand
the terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed,
so I shall look through the evening papers since then,
and perhaps I shall get some new light.  I am not sleepy,
and the work will help to keep me quiet.




DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


30 September.--Mr. Harker arrived at nine o'clock. He got his wife's wire just
before starting.  He is uncommonly clever, if one can judge from his face,
and full of energy.  If this journal be true, and judging by one's own
wonderful experiences, it must be, he is also a man of great nerve.
That going down to the vault a second time was a remarkable piece of daring.
After reading his account of it I was prepared to meet a good specimen
of manhood, but hardly the quiet, businesslike gentleman who came here today.


LATER.--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room,
and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter.
They are hard at it.  Mrs. Harker says that knitting together
in chronological order every scrap of evidence they have.
Harker has got the letters between the consignee of the boxes
at Whitby and the carriers in London who took charge of them.
He is now reading his wife's transcript of my diary.
I wonder what they make out of it.  Here it is.  . .


Strange that it never struck me that the very next house
might be the Count's hiding place!  Goodness knows that we
had enough clues from the conduct of the patient Renfield!
The bundle of letters relating to the purchase of the house
were with the transcript.  Oh, if we had only had them earlier
we might have saved poor Lucy!  Stop!  That way madness lies!
Harker has gone back, and is again collecting material.
He says that by dinner time they will be able to show
a whole connected narrative.  He thinks that in the meantime
I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort
of index to the coming and going of the Count.  I hardly see
this yet, but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall.
What a good thing that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type!
We never could have found the dates otherwise.

I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded,
smiling benignly.  At the moment he seemed as sane as any one I ever saw.
I sat down and talked with him on a lot of subjects, all of which
he treated naturally.  He then, of his own accord, spoke of going home,
a subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during his sojourn here.
In fact, he spoke quite confidently of getting his discharge at once.
I believe that, had I not had the chat with Harker and read the letters
and the dates of his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him
after a brief time of observation.  As it is, I am darkly suspicious.
All those out-breaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the Count.
What then does this absolute content mean?  Can it be that his instinct
is satisfied as to the vampire's ultimate triumph?  Stay.  He is
himself zoophagous, and in his wild ravings outside the chapel door
of the deserted house he always spoke of `master'. This all seems
confirmation of our idea.  However, after a while I came away.
My friend is just a little too sane at present to make it safe to probe
him too deep with questions.  He might begin to think, and then.
. .So I came away.  I mistrust these quiet moods of of his, so I have given
the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to have a strait
waistcoat ready in case of need.





JOHNATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


29 September, in train to London.--When I received
Mr. Billington's courteous message that he would give me
any information in his power I thought it best to go down
to Whitby and make, on the spot, such inquiries as I wanted.
It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the Count's
to its place in London.  Later, we may be able to deal with it.
Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and brought
me to his father's house, where they had decided that I must spend
the night.  They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality,
give a guest everything and leave him to do as he likes.
They all knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short,
and Mr. Billington had ready in his office all the papers
concerning the consignment of boxes.  It gave me almost a turn
to see again one of the letters which I had seen on the Count's
table before I knew of his diabolical plans.  Everything had been
carefully thought out, and done systematically and with precision.
He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which
might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions
being carried out.  To use and Americanism, he had `taken no
chances', and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions
were fulfilled was simply the logical result of his care.
I saw the invoice, and took note of it.`Fifty cases of
common earth, to be used for experimental purposes'. Also
the copy of the letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply.
Of both these I got copies.  This was all the information
Mr. Billington could give me, so I went down to the port and saw
the coastguards, the Customs Officers and the harbor master,
who kindly put me in communication with the men who had actually
received the boxes.  Their tally was exact with the list,
and they had nothing to add to the simple description `fifty
cases of common earth', except that the boxes were `main
and mortal heavy', and that shifting them was dry work.
One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn't
any gentleman `such like as like yourself, squire', to show
some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form.
Another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such
that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it.
Needless to add, I took care before leaving to lift,
forever and adequately, this source of reproach.

30 September.--The station master was good enough to give me a line to his
old companion the station master at King's Cross, so that when I arrived
there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes.
He, too put me at once in communication with the proper officials,
and I saw that their tally was correct with the original invoice.
The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited.
A noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was compelled
to deal with the result in ex post facto manner.

From thence I went to Carter Paterson's central office,
where I met with the utmost courtesy.  They looked up
the transaction in their day book and letter book, and at once
telephoned to their King's Cross office for more details.
By good fortune, the men who did the teaming were waiting
for work, and the official at once sent them over,
sending also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers
connected with the delivery of the boxes at Carfax.
Here again I found the tally agreeing exactly.  The carriers'
men were able to supplement the paucity of the written words
with a few more details.  These were, I shortly found,
connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job,
and the consequent thirst engendered in the operators.
On my affording an opportunity, through the medium of the
currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a later period,
this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked,

""That `ere `ouse, guv'nor, is the rummiest I ever
was in.  Blyme!  But it ain't been touched sence a hundred years.
There was dust that thick in the place that you might have slep'
on it without `urtin' of yer bones.  An' the place was that
neglected that yer might `ave smelled ole Jerusalem in it.
But the old chapel, that took the cike, that did!
Me and my mate, we thort we wouldn't never git out quick enough.
Lor', I wouldn't take less nor a quid a moment to stay
there arter dark.""

Having been in the house, I could well believe him, but if he knew
what I know, he would, I think have raised his terms.

Of one thing I am now satisfied.  That all those boxes which arrived at Whitby
from Varna in the Demeter were safely deposited in the old chapel at Carfax.
There should be fifty of them there, unless any have since been removed,
as from Dr. Seward's diary I fear.


Later.--Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all
the papers into order.




MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


30 September.--I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself.
It is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had,
that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound
might act detrimentally on Jonathan.  I saw him leave for Whitby
with as brave a face as could, but I was sick with apprehension.
The effort has, however, done him good.  He was never so resolute,
never so strong, never so full of volcanic energy, as at present.
It is just as that dear, good Professor Van Helsing said, he is true grit,
and he improves under strain that would kill a weaker nature.  He came
back full of life and hope and determination.  We have got everything
in order for tonight.  I feel myself quite wild with excitement.
I suppose one ought to pity anything so hunted as the Count.
That is just it.  This thing is not human, not even a beast.
To read Dr. Seward's account of poor Lucy's death, and what followed,
is enough to dry up the springs of pity in one's heart.


Later.--Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we expected.
Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with him,
so I had to see them.  It was to me a painful meeting, for it
brought back all poor dear Lucy's hopes of only a few months ago.
Of course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that
Dr. Van Helsing, too, had been quite `blowing my trumpet', as Mr. Morris
expressed it.  Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know
all about the proposals they made to Lucy.  They did not quite know
what to say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge.
So they had to keep on neutral subjects.  However, I thought
the matter over, and came to the conclusion that the best thing
I could do would be to post them on affairs right up to date.
I knew from Dr. Seward's diary that they had been at Lucy's death,
her real death, and that I need not fear to betray any secret
before the time.  So I told them, as well as I could, that I
had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband and I,
having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.
I gave them each a copy to read in the library.  When Lord Godalming
got his and turned it over, it does make a pretty good pile, he said,
""Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?""

I nodded, and he went on.

""I don't quite see the drift of it, but you people are all so good
and kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically,
that all I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you.
I have had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man
humble to the last hour of his life.  Besides, I know you loved my Lucy.
. .""

Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands.
I could hear the tears in his voice.  Mr. Morris,
with instinctive delicacy, just laid a hand for a moment
on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the room.
I suppose there is something in a woman's nature that makes
a man free to break down before her and express his feelings
on the tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory
to his manhood.  For when Lord Godalming found himself alone
with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly.
I sat down beside him and took his hand.  I hope he didn't think
it forward of me, and that if her ever thinks of it afterwards
he never will have such a thought.  There I wrong him.
I know he never will.  He is too true a gentleman.
I said to him, for I could see that his heart was breaking,
""I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you
were to her.  She and I were like sisters, and now she is gone,
will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble?
I know what sorrows you have had, though I cannot measure the depth
of them.  If sympathy and pity can help in your affliction,
won't you let me be of some little service, for Lucy's sake?""

In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief.
It seemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence
found a vent at once.  He grew quite hysterical, and raising his
open hands, beat his palms together in a perfect agony of grief.
He stood up and then sat down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks.
I felt an infinite pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly.
With a sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child,
whilst he shook with emotion.

We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise
above smaller matters when the mother spirit is invoked.
I felt this big sorrowing man's head resting on me, as though
it were that of a baby that some day may lie on my bosom,
and I stroked his hair as though he were my own child.
I never thought at the time how strange it all was.

After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an apology,
though he made no disguise of his emotion.  He told me that for days
and nights past, weary days and sleepless nights, he had been unable
to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of sorrow.
There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with whom,
owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded,
he could speak freely.

""I know now how I suffered,"" he said, as he dried his eyes,
""but I do not know even yet, and none other can ever know,
how much your sweet sympathy has been to me today.
I shall know better in time, and believe me that, though I am
not ungrateful now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding.
You will let me be like a brother, will you not, for all our lives,
for dear Lucy's sake?""

""For dear Lucy's sake,"" I said as we clasped hands.""Ay,
and for your own sake,"" he added, ""for if a man's esteem and
gratitude are ever worth the winning, you have won mine today.
If ever the future should bring to you a time when you
need a man's help, believe me, you will not call in vain.
God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break
the sunshine of your life, but if it should ever come,
promise me that you will let me know.""

He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that I felt
it would comfort him, so I said, ""I promise.""

As I came along the corridor I say Mr. Morris looking out of a window.
He turned as he heard my footsteps.  ""How is Art?"" he said.  Then noticing
my red eyes, he went on, ""Ah, I see you have been comforting him.
Poor old fellow!  He needs it.  No one but a woman can help a man
when he is in trouble of the heart, and he had no one to comfort him.""

He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him.
I saw the manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read
it he would realize how much I knew, so I said to him, ""I wish I
could comfort all who suffer from the heart.  Will you let me be
your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it?
You will know later why I speak.""

He saw that I was in earnest, and stooping, took my hand, and raising
it to his lips, kissed it.  It seemed but poor comfort to so brave
and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I bent over and kissed him.
The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a momentary choking
in his throat.  He said quite calmly, ""Little girl, you will never
forget that true hearted kindness, so long as ever you live!""
Then he went into the study to his friend.

""Little girl!""  The very words he had used to Lucy, and, oh, but he proved
himself a friend.





CHAPTER 18


DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


30 September.--I got home at five o'clock, and found that Godalming
and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript
of the various diaries and letters which Harker had not yet returned from
his visit to the carriers' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me.
Mrs. Harker gave us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the
first time since I have lived in it, this old house seemed like home.
When we had finished, Mrs. Harker said,

""Dr. Seward, may I ask a favor?  I want to see your patient, Mr. Renfield.
Do let me see him.  What you have said of him in your diary interests
me so much!""

She looked so appealing and so pretty that I could not refuse her,
and there was no possible reason why I should, so I took her with me.
When I went into the room, I told the man that a lady would like to see him,
to which he simply answered, ""Why?""

""She is going through the house, and wants to see every one
in it,"" I answered.

""Oh, very well,"" he said, ""let her come in, by all means,
but just wait a minute till I tidy up the place.""

His method of tidying was peculiar, he simply swallowed all
the flies and spiders in the boxes before I could stop him.
It was quite evident that he feared, or was jealous of,
some interference.  When he had got through his disgusting task,
he said cheerfully, ""Let the lady come in,"" and sat down
on the edge of his bed with his head down, but with his
eyelids raised so that he could see her as she entered.
For a moment I thought that he might have some homicidal intent.
I remembered how quiet he had been just before he attacked me
in my own study, and I took care to stand where I could seize
him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her.

She came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once
command the respect of any lunatic, for easiness is one of the qualities
mad people most respect.  She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly,
and held out her hand.

""Good evening, Mr. Renfield,"" said she.  ""You see, I know you,
for Dr. Seward has told me of you.""  He made no immediate reply,
but eyed her all over intently with a set frown on his face.
This look gave way to one of wonder, which merged in doubt,
then to my intense astonishment he said, ""You're not the girl
the doctor wanted to marry, are you?  You can't be, you know,
for she's dead.""

Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied, ""Oh no!  I have a husband
of my own, to whom I was married before I ever saw Dr. Seward, or he me.
I am Mrs. Harker.""

""Then what are you doing here?""

""My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.""

""Then don't stay.""

""But why not?""

I thought that this style of conversation might not be pleasant
to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in,
""How did you know I wanted to marry anyone?""

His reply was simply contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned
his eyes from Mrs. Harker to me, instantly turning them back again,
""What an asinine question!""

""I don't see that at all, Mr. Renfield,"" said Mrs. Harker,
at once championing me.

He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as he had shown
contempt to me, ""You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker,
that when a man is so loved and honored as our host is,
everything regarding him is of interest in our little community.
Dr. Seward is loved not only by his household and his friends,
but even by his patients, who, being some of them hardly
in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and effects.
Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I cannot
but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates
lean towards the errors of non causa and ignoratio elenche.""

I positively opened my eyes at this new development.
Here was my own pet lunatic, the most pronounced of his type
that I had ever met with, talking elemental philosophy,
and with the manner of a polished gentleman.  I wonder if it was
Mrs. Harker's presence which had touched some chord in his memory.
If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any way due to her
unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or power.

We continued to talk for some time, and seeing that he was seemingly
quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she began,
to lead him to his favorite topic.  I was again astonished, for he addressed
himself to the question with the impartiality of the completest sanity.
He even took himself as an example when he mentioned certain things.

""Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief.
Indeed, it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed,
and insisted on my being put under control.  I used to fancy
that life was a positive and perpetual entity, and that by
consuming a multitude of live things, no matter how low in
the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong life.
At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually
tried to take human life.  The doctor here will bear me
out that on one occasion I tried to kill him for the purpose
of strengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with
my own body of his life through the medium of his blood,
relying of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, `For the blood
is the life.'  Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum
has vulgarized the truism to the very point of contempt.
Isn't that true, doctor?""

I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what
to either think or say, it was hard to imagine that I had seen
him eat up his spiders and flies not five minutes before.
Looking at my watch, I saw that I should go to the station to meet
Van Helsing, so I told Mrs. Harker that it was time to leave.

She came at once, after saying pleasantly to Mr. Renfield,
""Goodbye, and I hope I may see you often, under auspices
pleasanter to yourself.""

To which, to my astonishment, he replied, ""Goodbye, my dear.
I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.
May He bless and keep you!""

When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind me.
Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took ill,
and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for many
a long day.

Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a boy.
He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying, ""Ah, friend John,
how goes all?  Well?  So!  I have been busy, for I come here to stay
if need be.  All affairs are settled with me, and I have much to tell.
Madam Mina is with you?  Yes.  And her so fine husband?  And Arthur
and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too?  Good!""

As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my
own diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker's suggestion,
at which the Professor interrupted me.

""Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina!  She has man's brain, a brain
that a man should have were he much gifted, and a woman's heart.
The good God fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made
that so good combination.  Friend John, up to now fortune has made
that woman of help to us, after tonight she must not have to do with this
so terrible affair.  It is not good that she run a risk so great.
We men are determined, nay, are we not pledged, to destroy this monster?
But it is no part for a woman.  Even if she be not harmed, her heart
may fail her in so much and so many horrors and hereafter she may suffer,
both in waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams.
And, besides, she is young woman and not so long married,
there may be other things to think of some time, if not now.
You tell me she has wrote all, then she must consult with us,
but tomorrow she say goodbye to this work, and we go alone.""

I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we
had found in his absence, that the house which Dracula
had bought was the very next one to my own.  He was amazed,
and a great concern seemed to come on him.

""Oh that we had known it before!"" he said, ""for then we might
have reached him in time to save poor Lucy.  However, `the milk
that is spilt cries not out afterwards,'as you say.  We shall
not think of that, but go on our way to the end.""  Then he fell
into a silence that lasted till we entered my own gateway.
Before we went to prepare for dinner he said to Mrs. Harker,
""I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your
husband have put up in exact order all things that have been,
up to this moment.""

""Not up to this moment, Professor,"" she said impulsively,
""but up to this morning.""

""But why not up to now?  We have seen hitherto how good light
all the little things have made.  We have told our secrets,
and yet no one who has told is the worse for it.""

Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from
her pockets, she said, ""Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this,
and tell me if it must go in.  It is my record of today.
I too have seen the need of putting down at present everything,
however trivial, but there is little in this except what is personal.
Must it go in?""

The Professor read it over gravely, and handed it back, saying,
""It need not go in if you do not wish it, but I pray that it may.
It can but make your husband love you the more, and all us,
your friends, more honor you, as well as more esteem and love.""
She took it back with another blush and a bright smile.

And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete
and in order.  The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,
and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o'clock. The rest of us
have already read everything, so when we meet in the study we shall all
be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this
terrible and mysterious enemy.





MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


30 September.--When we met in Dr. Seward's study two hours after dinner,
which had been at six o'clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of board
or committee.  Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table,
to which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room.
He made me sit next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary.
Jonathan sat next to me.  Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward,
and Mr. Morris, Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward
in the center.

The Professor said, ""I may, I suppose, take it that we are
all acquainted with the facts that are in these papers.""
We all expressed assent, and he went on, ""Then it were, I think,
good that I tell you something of the kind of enemy with which
we have to deal.  I shall then make known to you something
of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.
So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take
our measure according.

""There are such beings as vampires, some of us have evidence that
they exist.  Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience,
the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough
for sane peoples.  I admit that at the first I was sceptic.
Were it not that through long years I have trained myself
to keep an open mind, I could not have believed until
such time as that fact thunder on my ear.`See! See!
I prove, I prove.'  Alas!  Had I known at first what now
I know, nay, had I even guess at him, one so precious
life had been spared to many of us who did love her.
But that is gone, and we must so work, that other poor souls
perish not, whilst we can save.  The nosferatu do not die
like the bee when he sting once.  He is only stronger,
and being stronger, have yet more power to work evil.
This vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person
as twenty men, he is of cunning more than mortal, for his cunning
be the growth of ages, he have still the aids of necromancy,
which is, as his etymology imply, the divination by the dead,
and all the dead that he can come nigh to are for him at command,
he is brute, and more than brute, he is devil in callous,
and the heart of him is not, he can, within his range,
direct the elements, the storm, the fog, the thunder,
he can command all the meaner things, the rat, and the owl,
and the bat, the moth, and the fox, and the wolf, he can grow
and become small, and he can at times vanish and come unknown.
How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him?  How shall
we find his where, and having found it, how can we destroy?
My friends, this is much, it is a terrible task that we undertake,
and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder.
For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win,
and then where end we?  Life is nothings, I heed him not.
But to fail here, is not mere life or death.  It is that we become
as him, that we henceforward become foul things of the night
like him, without heart or conscience, preying on the bodies
and the souls of those we love best.  To us forever are
the gates of heaven shut, for who shall open them to us again?
We go on for all time abhorred by all, a blot on the face of
God's sunshine, an arrow in the side of Him who died for man.
But we are face to face with duty, and in such case must
we shrink?  For me, I say no, but then I am old, and life,
with his sunshine, his fair places, his song of birds,
his music and his love, lie far behind.  You others are young.
Some have seen sorrow, but there are fair days yet in store.
What say you?""

Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand.  I feared,
oh so much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming
him when I saw his hand stretch out, but it was life to me
to feel its touch, so strong, so self reliant, so resolute.
A brave man's hand can speak for itself, it does not even need
a woman's love to hear its music.

When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes,
and I in his, there was no need for speaking between us.

""I answer for Mina and myself,"" he said.

""Count me in, Professor,"" said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.

""I am with you,"" said Lord Godalming, ""for Lucy's sake,
if for no other reason.""

Dr. Seward simply nodded.

The Professor stood up and, after laying his golden
crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side.
I took his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left, Jonathan held
my right with his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris.
So as we all took hands our solemn compact was made.  I felt
my heart icy cold, but it did not even occur to me to draw back.
We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing went on with a sort
of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had begun.
It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,
as any other transaction of life.

""Well, you know what we have to contend against, but we too,
are not without strength.  We have on our side power
of combination, a power denied to the vampire kind,
we have sources of science, we are free to act and think,
and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.
In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered,
and we are free to use them.  We have self devotion in a
cause and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one.
These things are much.

""Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against
us are restrict, and how the individual cannot.  In fine,
let us consider the limitations of the vampire in general,
and of this one in particular.

""All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions.
These do not at the first appear much, when the matter is one
of life and death, nay of more than either life or death.
Yet must we be satisfied, in the first place because we
have to be, no other means is at our control, and secondly,
because, after all these things, tradition and superstition,
are everything.  Does not the belief in vampires rest for others,
though not, alas! for us, on them!  A year ago which of us
would have received such a possibility, in the midst of
our scientific, sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century?
We even scouted a belief that we saw justified under our very eyes.
Take it, then, that the vampire, and the belief in his
limitations and his cure, rest for the moment on the same base.
For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere that men have been.
In old Greece, in old Rome, he flourish in Germany all over,
in France, in India, even in the Chermosese, and in China, so far
from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples for him
at this day.  He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander,
the devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar.

""So far, then, we have all we may act upon, and let me
tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified
by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience.
The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the time,
he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living.
Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow younger,
that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though
they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty.

""But he cannot flourish without this diet, he eat not as others.
Even friend Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see
him eat, never!  He throws no shadow, he make in the mirror no reflect,
as again Jonathan observe.  He has the strength of many of his hand,
witness again Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolves,
and when he help him from the diligence too.  He can transform himself
to wolf, as we gather from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear
open the dog, he can be as bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window
at Whitby, and as friend John saw him fly from this so near house,
and as my friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy.

""He can come in mist which he create, that noble ship's captain proved
him of this, but, from what we know, the distance he can make this mist
is limited, and it can only be round himself.

""He come on moonlight rays as elemental dust, as again
Jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of Dracula.
He become so small, we ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was
at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door.
He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything
or into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused
up with fire, solder you call it.  He can see in the dark,
no small power this, in a world which is one half shut from
the light.  Ah, but hear me through.

""He can do all these things, yet he is not free.  Nay, he is even more
prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.
He cannot go where he lists, he who is not of nature has yet
to obey some of nature's laws, why we know not.  He may not enter
anywhere at the first, unless there be some one of the household
who bid him to come, though afterwards he can come as he please.
His power ceases, as does that of all evil things, at the coming
of the day.

""Only at certain times can he have limited freedom.
If he be not at the place whither he is bound, he can
only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.
These things we are told, and in this record of ours we have
proof by inference.  Thus, whereas he can do as he will within
his limit, when he have his earth-home, his coffin-home,
his hell-home, the place unhallowed, as we saw when he went
to the grave of the suicide at Whitby, still at other time he can
only change when the time come.  It is said, too, that he can
only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide.
Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no power,
as the garlic that we know of, and as for things sacred,
as this symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even
now when we resolve, to them he is nothing, but in their
presence he take his place far off and silent with respect.
There are others, too, which I shall tell you of, lest in our
seeking we may need them.

""The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move
not from it, a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him
so that he be true dead, and as for the stake through him,
we know already of its peace, or the cut off head that giveth rest.
We have seen it with our eyes.

""Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine him
to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know.  But he is clever.
I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to make his record,
and from all the means that are, he tell me of what he has been.
He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against
the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkeyland.
If it be so, then was he no common man, for in that time, and for
centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning,
as well as the bravest of the sons of the `land beyond the forest.'
That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his grave,
and are even now arrayed against us.  The Draculas were, says Arminius,
a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who were
held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One.
They learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains
over Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar
as his due.  In the records are such words as `stregoica' witch,
`ordog' and `pokol' Satan and hell, and in one manuscript this very
Dracula is spoken of as `wampyr,'which we all understand too well.
There have been from the loins of this very one great men and good women,
and their graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell.
For it is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted
deep in all good, in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.""

Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at
the window, and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room.
There was a little pause, and then the Professor went on.

""And now we must settle what we do.  We have here much data,
and we must proceed to lay out our campaign.  We know from
the inquiry of Jonathan that from the castle to Whitby came
fifty boxes of earth, all of which were delivered at Carfax,
we also know that at least some of these boxes have been removed.
It seems to me, that our first step should be to ascertain
whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall
where we look today, or whether any more have been removed.
If the latter, we must trace.  . .""

Here we were interrupted in a very startling way.
Outside the house came the sound of a pistol shot, the glass
of the window was shattered with a bullet, which ricochetting
from the top of the embrasure, struck the far wall of the room.
I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked out.
The men all jumped to their feet, Lord Godalming flew over
to the window and threw up the sash.  As he did so we heard
Mr. Morris' voice without, ""Sorry!  I fear I have alarmed you.
I shall come in and tell you about it.""

A minute later he came in and said, ""It was an idiotic
thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs. Harker,
most sincerely, I fear I must have frightened you terribly.
But the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking
there came a big bat and sat on the window sill.
I have got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent events
that I cannot stand them, and I went out to have a shot, as I
have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have seen one.
You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.""

""Did you hit it?"" asked Dr. Van Helsing.

""I don't know, I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.""
Without saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor
began to resume his statement.

""We must trace each of these boxes, and when we are ready, we must either
capture or kill this monster in his lair, or we must, so to speak,
sterilize the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.
Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours
of noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.

""And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.
You are too precious to us to have such risk.  When we part tonight,
you no more must question.  We shall tell you all in good time.
We are men and are able to bear, but you must be our star and our hope,
and we shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger,
such as we are.""

All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved, but it did
not seem to me good that they should brave danger and,
perhaps lessen their safety, strength being the best safety,
through care of me, but their minds were made up, and though
it was a bitter pill for me to swallow, I could say nothing,
save to accept their chivalrous care of me.

Mr. Morris resumed the discussion, ""As there is no time
to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right now.
Time is everything with him, and swift action on our part
may save another victim.""

I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action
came so close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater
fear that if I appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work,
they might even leave me out of their counsels altogether.
They have now gone off to Carfax, with means to get into the house.

Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep,
as if a woman can sleep when those she loves are in danger!
I shall lie down, and pretend to sleep, lest Jonathan have added
anxiety about me when he returns.




DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


1 October, 4 A.M.--Just as we were about to leave the house, an urgent
message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see him
at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.
I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the morning,
I was busy just at the moment.

The attendant added, ""He seems very importunate, sir.
I have never seen him so eager.  I don't know but what, if you
don't see him soon, he will have one of his violent fits.""
I knew the man would not have said this without some cause,
so I said, ""All right, I'll go now,"" and I asked the others
to wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my patient.

""Take me with you, friend John,"" said the Professor.""His case in your diary
interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on our case.
I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is disturbed.""

""May I come also?"" asked Lord Godalming.

""Me too?"" said Quincey Morris.  ""May I come?"" said Harker.
I nodded, and we all went down the passage together.

We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far
more rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him.
There was an unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike
anything I had ever met with in a lunatic, and he took it for
granted that his reasons would prevail with others entirely sane.
We all five went into the room, but none of the others
at first said anything.  His request was that I would
at once release him from the asylum and send him home.
This he backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery,
and adduced his own existing sanity.

""I appeal to your friends, ""he said, ""they will, perhaps, not mind sitting
in judgement on my case.  By the way, you have not introduced me.""

I was so much astonished, that the oddness of introducing a madman
in an asylum did not strike me at the moment, and besides,
there was a certain dignity in the man's manner, so much
of the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction,
""Lord Godalming, Professor Van Helsing, Mr. Quincey Morris,
of Texas, Mr. Jonathan Harker, Mr. Renfield.""

He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn, ""Lord Godalming,
I had the honor of seconding your father at the Windham,
I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no more.
He was a man loved and honored by all who knew him, and in his
youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch,
much patronized on Derby night.  Mr. Morris, you should be proud
of your great state.  Its reception into the Union was a precedent
which may have far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole
and the Tropics may hold alliance to the Stars and Stripes.
The power of Treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement,
when the Monroe doctrine takes its true place as a political fable.
What shall any man say of his pleasure at meeting Van Helsing?
Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix.
When an individual has revolutionized therapeutics by his discovery
of the continuous evolution of brain matter, conventional forms
are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to one of a class.
You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by the possession
of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective places in
the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at least
the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.
And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist
as well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me
as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances.""He made
this last appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not
without its own charm.

I think we were all staggered.  For my own part, I was under
the conviction, despite my knowledge of the man's character and history,
that his reason had been restored, and I felt under a strong impulse
to tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see
about the necessary formalities for his release in the morning.
I thought it better to wait, however, before making so grave
a statement, for of old I knew the sudden changes to which this
particular patient was liable.  So I contented myself with making
a general statement that he appeared to be improving very rapidly,
that I would have a longer chat with him in the morning, and would
then see what I could do in the direction of meeting his wishes.

This did not at all satisfy him, for he said quickly,
""But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish.
I desire to go at once, here, now, this very hour, this very moment,
if I may.  Time presses, and in our implied agreement with
the old scytheman it is of the essence of the contract.
I am sure it is only necessary to put before so admirable
a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so momentous a wish,
to ensure its fulfilment.""

He looked at me keenly, and seeing the negative in my face,
turned to the others, and scrutinized them closely.
Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on, ""Is it possible
that I have erred in my supposition?""

""You have,"" I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.

There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly,
""Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request.
Let me ask for this concession, boon, privilege, what you will.
I am content to implore in such a case, not on personal grounds,
but for the sake of others.  I am not at liberty to give
you the whole of my reasons, but you may, I assure you,
take it from me that they are good ones, sound and unselfish,
and spring from the highest sense of duty.

""Could you look, sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full
the sentiments which animate me.  Nay, more, you would count me
amongst the best and truest of your friends.""

Again he looked at us all keenly.  I had a growing conviction
that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method
was but yet another phase of his madness, and so determined
to let him go on a little longer, knowing from experience
that he would, like all lunatics, give himself away in the end.
Van Helsing was gazing at him with a look of utmost intensity,
his bushy eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration
of his look.  He said to Renfield in a tone which did not surprise
me at the time, but only when I thought of it afterwards,
for it was as of one addressing an equal, ""Can you not tell
frankly your real reason for wishing to be free tonight?
I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me, a stranger,
without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind,
Dr. Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his
own responsibility, the privilege you seek.""

He shook his head sadly, and with a look of poignant regret on
his face.  The Professor went on, ""Come, sir, bethink yourself.
You claim the privilege of reason in the highest degree,
since you seek to impress us with your complete reasonableness.
You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since you are
not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect.
If you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course,
how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us?
Be wise, and help us, and if we can we shall aid you to
achieve your wish.""

He still shook his head as he said, ""Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say.
Your argument is complete, and if I were free to speak I should
not hesitate a moment, but I am not my own master in the matter.
I can only ask you to trust me.  If I am refused, the responsibility
does not rest with me.""

I thought it was now time to end the scene, which was becoming
too comically grave, so I went towards the door, simply saying,
""Come, my friends, we have work to do.  Goodnight.""

As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient.
He moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared
that he was about to make another homicidal attack.
My fears, however, were groundless, for he held up his two
hands imploringly, and made his petition in a moving manner.
As he saw that the very excess of his emotion was militating
against him, by restoring us more to our old relations,
he became still more demonstrative.  I glanced at Van Helsing,
and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes, so I became
a little more fixed in my manner, if not more stern,
and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing.
I had previously seen something of the same constantly
growing excitement in him when he had to make some request
of which at the time he had thought much, such for instance,
as when he wanted a cat, and I was prepared to see the collapse
into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion.

My expectation was not realized, for when he found that his appeal
would not be successful, he got into quite a frantic condition.
He threw himself on his knees, and held up his hands, wringing them
in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a torrent of entreaty,
with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his whole face and form
expressive of the deepest emotion.

""Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out
of this house at once.  Send me away how you will and where you will,
send keepers with me with whips and chains, let them take me in a
strait waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to gaol, but let me
go out of this.  You don't know what you do by keeping me here.
I am speaking from the depths of my heart, of my very soul.
You don't know whom you wrong, or how, and I may not tell.  Woe is me!
I may not tell.  By all you hold sacred, by all you hold dear,
by your love that is lost, by your hope that lives, for the sake
of the Almighty, take me out of this and save my soul from guilt!
Can't you hear me, man?  Can't you understand?  Will you never learn?
Don't you know that I am sane and earnest now, that I am no lunatic
in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting for his soul?  Oh, hear me!
Hear me!  Let me go, let me go, let me go!""

I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get,
and so would bring on a fit, so I took him by the hand and
raised him up.

""Come,"" I said sternly, ""no more of this, we have had quite enough already.
Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.""

He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments.
Then, without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side
of the bed.  The collapse had come, as on former occasions,
just as I had expected.

When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me
in a quiet, well-bred voice, ""You will, I trust, Dr. Seward,
do me the justice to bear in mind, later on, that I did what I
could to convince you tonight.""





CHAPTER 19


JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


1 October, 5 A.M.--I went with the party to the search with an easy mind,
for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well.
I am so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.
Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business
at all, but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her
energy and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together
in such a way that every point tells, she may well feel that her part
is finished, and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us.
We were, I think, all a little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield.
When we came away from his room we were silent till we got back
to the study.

Then Mr. Morris said to Dr. Seward, ""Say, Jack, if that man wasn't
attempting a bluff, he is about the sanest lunatic I ever saw.
I'm not sure, but I believe that he had some serious purpose,
and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a chance.""

Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added,
""Friend John, you know more lunatics than I do, and I'm glad
of it, for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would
before that last hysterical outburst have given him free.
But we live and learn, and in our present task we
must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.
All is best as they are.""

Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind of way,
""I don't know but that I agree with you.  If that man had been
an ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him,
but he seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way
that I am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads.
I can't forget how he prayed with almost equal fervor for a cat,
and then tried to tear my throat out with his teeth.
Besides, he called the Count `lord and master', and he may want
to get out to help him in some diabolical way.  That horrid
thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him,
so I suppose he isn't above trying to use a respectable lunatic.
He certainly did seem earnest, though.  I only hope we have
done what is best.  These things, in conjunction with the wild
work we have in hand, help to unnerve a man.""

The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand on his shoulder,
said in his grave, kindly way, ""Friend John, have no fear.
We are trying to do our duty in a very sad and terrible case,
we can only do as we deem best.  What else have we to hope for,
except the pity of the good God?""

Lord Godalming had slipped away for a few minutes, but now he returned.
He held up a little silver whistle, as he remarked, ""That old place
may be full of rats, and if so, I've got an antidote on call.""

Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care to keep
in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone out.
When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out a lot
of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four little groups,
evidently one for each.  Then he spoke.

""My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need
arms of many kinds.  Our enemy is not merely spiritual.
Remember that he has the strength of twenty men, and that,
though our necks or our windpipes are of the common kind,
and therefore breakable or crushable, his are not amenable
to mere strength.  A stronger man, or a body of men more
strong in all than him, can at certain times hold him,
but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him.
We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his touch.
Keep this near your heart.""  As he spoke he lifted a little
silver crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him,
""put these flowers round your neck,"" here he handed to me a wreath
of withered garlic blossoms, ""for other enemies more mundane,
this revolver and this knife, and for aid in all, these so
small electric lamps, which you can fasten to your breast,
and for all, and above all at the last, this, which we must
not desecrate needless.""

This was a portion of Sacred Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed
to me.  Each of the others was similarly equipped.

""Now,"" he said, ""friend John, where are the skeleton keys?
If so that we can open the door, we need not break house
by the window, as before at Miss Lucy's.""

Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical
dexterity as a surgeon standing him in good stead.
Presently he got one to suit, after a little play back and
forward the bolt yielded, and with a rusty clang, shot back.
We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and it
slowly opened.  It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me
in Dr. Seward's diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb,
I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others,
for with one accord they shrank back.  The Professor was
the first to move forward, and stepped into the open door.

""In manus tuas, Domine!""he said, crossing himself as he passed over
the threshold.  We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have
lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road.
The Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able
to open it from within should we be in a hurry making our exit.
Then we all lit our lamps and proceeded on our search.

The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the rays
crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great shadows.
I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there was someone else
amongst us.  I suppose it was the recollection, so powerfully brought home
to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible experience in Transylvania.
I think the feeling was common to us all, for I noticed that the others
kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and every new shadow,
just as I felt myself doing.

The whole place was thick with dust.  The floor was seemingly inches deep,
except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down
my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked.
The walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were
masses of spider's webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked
like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down.
On a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed
label on each.  They had been used several times, for on the table were
several similar rents in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed
when the Professor lifted them.

He turned to me and said, ""You know this place, Jonathan.
You have copied maps of it, and you know it at least more than we do.
Which is the way to the chapel?""

I had an idea of its direction, though on my former visit I
had not been able to get admission to it, so I led the way,
and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite a low,
arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.

""This is the spot,"" said the Professor as he turned his lamp
on a small map of the house, copied from the file of my
original correspondence regarding the purchase.  With a little
trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door.
We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for as we were opening
the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps,
but none of us ever expected such an odor as we encountered.
None of the others had met the Count at all at close quarters,
and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of his
existence in his rooms or, when he was bloated with fresh blood,
in a ruined building open to the air, but here the place was small
and close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul.
There was an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through
the fouler air.  But as to the odor itself, how shall I describe it?
It was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and
with the pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption
had become itself corrupt.  Faugh!  It sickens me to think of it.
Every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place
and intensified its loathsomeness.

Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought
our enterprise to an end, but this was no ordinary case,
and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave
us a strength which rose above merely physical considerations.
After the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first
nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our work as though
that loathsome place were a garden of roses.

We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying
as we began, ""The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left,
we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we
cannot get some clue as to what has become of the rest.""

A glance was sufficient to show how many remained, for the great earth
chests were bulky, and there was no mistaking them.

There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty!
Once I got a fright, for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn
and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond,
I looked too, and for an instant my heart stood still.
Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to see the high
lights of the Count's evil face, the ridge of the nose,
the red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor.  It was only
for a moment, for, as Lord Godalming said, ""I thought I saw
a face, but it was only the shadows,"" and resumed his inquiry,
I turned my lamp in the direction, and stepped into the passage.
There was no sign of anyone, and as there were no corners,
no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid walls
of the passage, there could be no hiding place even for him.
I took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.

A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner,
which he was examining.  We all followed his movements with our eyes,
for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw
a whole mass of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars.
We all instinctively drew back.  The whole place was becoming
alive with rats.

For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming,
who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency.  Rushing over to
the great iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from
the outside, and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock,
drew the huge bolts, and swung the door open.  Then, taking his
little silver whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call.
It was answered from behind Dr. Seward's house by the yelping of dogs,
and after about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner
of the house.  Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door,
and as we moved I noticed that the dust had been much disturbed.
The boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way.
But even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had
vastly increased.  They seemed to swarm over the place all at once,
till the lamplight, shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering,
baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies.
The dogs dashed on, but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled,
and then, simultaneously lifting their noses, began to howl in
most lugubrious fashion.  The rats were multiplying in thousands,
and we moved out.

Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in,
placed him on the floor.  The instant his feet touched the ground
he seemed to recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies.
They fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of
a score, the other dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner,
had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished.

With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed,
for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts
at their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them
in the air with vicious shakes.  We all seemed to find our spirits rise.
Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening
of the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding
ourselves in the open I know not, but most certainly the shadow of dread
seemed to slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost
something of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit
in our resolution.  We closed the outer door and barred and locked it,
and bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house.
We found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions,
and all untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.
Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when we
returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbit
hunting in a summer wood.

The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.
Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall door from the bunch,
and locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket
when he had done.

""So far,"" he said, ""our night has been eminently successful.
No harm has come to us such as I feared might be and
yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing.
More than all do I rejoice that this, our first, and perhaps
our most difficult and dangerous, step has been accomplished
without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina
or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights
and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget.
One lesson, too, we have learned, if it be allowable to argue
a particulari, that the brute beasts which are to the Count's
command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power,
for look, these rats that would come to his call, just as
from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going
and to that poor mother's cry, though they come to him,
they run pell-mell from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur.
We have other matters before us, other dangers, other fears,
and that monster.  . .He has not used his power over
the brute world for the only or the last time tonight.
So be it that he has gone elsewhere.  Good!  It has
given us opportunity to cry `check'in some ways in this
chess game, which we play for the stake of human souls.
And now let us go home.  The dawn is close at hand, and we
have reason to be content with our first night's work.
It may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow,
if full of peril, but we must go on, and from no danger
shall we shrink.""

The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor
creature who was screaming away in one of the distant wards,
and a low, moaning sound from Renfield's room.  The poor wretch
was doubtless torturing himself, after the manner of the insane,
with needless thoughts of pain.

I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep,
breathing so softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it.
She looks paler than usual.  I hope the meeting tonight has
not upset her.  I am truly thankful that she is to be left out
of our future work, and even of our deliberations.  It is too
great a strain for a woman to bear.  I did not think so at first,
but I know better now.  Therefore I am glad that it is settled.
There may be things which would frighten her to hear,
and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell
her if once she suspected that there was any concealment.
Henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to her, till at
least such time as we can tell her that all is finished,
and the earth free from a monster of the nether world.
I daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence
after such confidence as ours, but I must be resolute,
and tomorrow I shall keep dark over tonight's doings,
and shall refuse to speak of anything that has happened.
I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.


1 October, later.--I suppose it was natural that we should have
all overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night
had no rest at all.  Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion,
for though I slept till the sun was high, I was awake before her,
and had to call two or three times before she awoke.
Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a few seconds she did
not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of blank terror,
as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream.
She complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest
till later in the day.  We now know of twenty-one boxes
having been removed, and if it be that several were taken
in any of these removals we may be able to trace them all.
Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labor,
and the sooner the matter is attended to the better.
I shall look up Thomas Snelling today.

DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


1 October.--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor
walking into my room.  He was more jolly and cheerful than usual,
and it is quite evident that last night's work has helped to take
some of the brooding weight off his mind.

After going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said, ""Your patient
interests me much.  May it be that with you I visit him this morning?
Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may be.
It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,
and reason so sound.""

I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him that if he would go
alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to keep him waiting,
so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions.
Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against getting any
false impression from my patient.

""But,"" he answered, ""I want him to talk of himself and of his
delusion as to consuming live things.  He said to Madam Mina, as I
see in your diary of yesterday, that he had once had such a belief.
Why do you smile, friend John?""

""Excuse me,"" I said, ""but the answer is here.""  I laid my hand
on the typewritten matter.""When our sane and learned lunatic
made that very statement of how he used to consume life,
his mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and spiders
which he had eaten just before Mrs. Harker entered the room.""

Van Helsing smiled in turn.  ""Good!"" he said.
""Your memory is true, friend John.  I should have remembered.
And yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory
which makes mental disease such a fascinating study.
Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this
madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.
Who knows?""

I went on with my work, and before long was through that in hand.
It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was
Van Helsing back in the study.

""Do I interrupt?"" he asked politely as he stood at the door.

""Not at all,"" I answered.  ""Come in.  My work is finished, and I am free.
I can go with you now, if you like.""

""It is needless, I have seen him!""

""Well?""

""I fear that he does not appraise me at much.
Our interview was short.  When I entered his room he was
sitting on a stool in the center, with his elbows on his knees,
and his face was the picture of sullen discontent.
I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a measure
of respect as I could assume.  He made no reply whatever.
'Don't you know me?'  I asked.  His answer was not reassuring.
""I know you well enough, you are the old fool Van Helsing.
I wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain
theories somewhere else.  Damn all thick-headed Dutchmen!'
Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable sullenness
as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at all.
Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from
this so clever lunatic, so I shall go, if I may, and cheer
myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina.
Friend John, it does rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more
to be pained, no more to be worried with our terrible things.
Though we shall much miss her help, it is better so.""

""I agree with you with all my heart,"" I answered earnestly, for I did
not want him to weaken in this matter.  ""Mrs. Harker is better out of it.
Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have
been in many tight places in our time, but it is no place for a woman,
and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time
infallibly have wrecked her.""

So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker,
Quincey and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth boxes.
I shall finish my round of work and we shall meet tonight.





MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


1 October.--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am today,
after Jonathan's full confidence for so many years, to see him
manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all.
This morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though
Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier.  He spoke to me before
he went out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned
a word of what had happened in the visit to the Count's house.
And yet he must have known how terribly anxious I was.  Poor dear fellow!
I suppose it must have distressed him even more than it did me.
They all agreed that it was best that I should not be drawn further
into this awful work, and I acquiesced.  But to think that he keeps
anything from me!  And now I am crying like a silly fool, when I
know it comes from my husband's great love and from the good,
good wishes of those other strong men.

That has done me good.  Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all.
And lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment
that I kept anything from him, I still keep my journal as usual.
Then if he has feared of my trust I shall show it to him,
with every thought of my heart put down for his dear eyes
to read.  I feel strangely sad and low-spirited today.
I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible excitement.

Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told
me to.  I didn't feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety.
I kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to see
me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate pressing on
relentlessly to some destined end.  Everything that one does seems, no matter
how right it me be, to bring on the very thing which is most to be deplored.
If I hadn't gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear Lucy would be with us now.
She hadn't taken to visiting the churchyard till I came, and if she hadn't
come there in the day time with me she wouldn't have walked in her sleep.
And if she hadn't gone there at night and asleep, that monster couldn't
have destroyed her as he did.  Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby?
There now, crying again!  I wonder what has come over me today.
I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew that I had been crying twice
in one morning.  . .I, who never cried on my own account, and whom he has
never caused to shed a tear, the dear fellow would fret his heart out.
I shall put a bold face on, and if I do feel weepy, he shall never see it.
I suppose it is just one of the lessons that we poor women have to learn.
. .

I can't quite remember how I fell asleep last night.
I remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot
of queer sounds, like praying on a very tumultuous scale,
from Mr. Renfield's room, which is somewhere under this.
And then there was silence over everything, silence so profound
that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.
All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the
moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their own.
Not a thing seemed to be stirring, but all to be grim and fixed
as death or fate, so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept
with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards
the house, seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its own.
I think that the digression of my thoughts must have done me good,
for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy creeping over me.
I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out and
looked out of the window again.  The mist was spreading,
and was now close up to the house, so that I could see it
lying thick against the wall, as though it were stealing
up to the windows.  The poor man was more loud than ever,
and though I could not distinguish a word he said, I could
in some way recognize in his tones some passionate entreaty
on his part.  Then there was the sound of a struggle,
and I knew that the attendants were dealing with him.
I was so frightened that I crept into bed, and pulled
the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.
I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought,
but I must have fallen asleep, for except dreams, I do not
remember anything until the morning, when Jonathan woke me.
I think that it took me an effort and a little time to realize
where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was bending over me.
My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of the way
that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.

I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back.
I was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act, my feet,
and my hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could
proceed at the usual pace.  And so I slept uneasily and thought.
Then it began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold.
I put back the clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise,
that all was dim around.  The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan,
but turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog,
which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room.
Then it occurred to me that I had shut the window before I had
come to bed.  I would have got out to make certain on the point,
but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will.
I lay still and endured, that was all.  I closed my eyes, but could
still see through my eyelids.  (It is wonderful what tricks our dreams
play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The mist grew thicker
and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I could see it
like smoke, or with the white energy of boiling water, pouring in,
not through the window, but through the joinings of the door.
It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became concentrated
into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top
of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye.
Things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column
was now whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural
words ""a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.""  Was it
indeed such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep?
But the pillar was composed of both the day and the night guiding,
for the fire was in the red eye, which at the thought gat a new
fascination for me, till, as I looked, the fire divided, and seemed
to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes, such as Lucy
told me of in her momentary mental wandering when, on the cliff,
the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary's Church.
Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan
had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling
mist in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted,
for all became black darkness.  The last conscious effort which
imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending over me
out of the mist.

I must be careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one's reason if there
were too much of them.  I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe
something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm them.
Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their fears for me.
Tonight I shall strive hard to sleep naturally.  If I do not, I shall tomorrow
night get them to give me a dose of chloral, that cannot hurt me for once,
and it will give me a good night's sleep.  Last night tired me more than if I
had not slept at all.


2 October 10 P.M.--Last night I slept, but did not dream.
I must have slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan
coming to bed, but the sleep has not refreshed me, for today I
feel terribly weak and spiritless.  I spent all yesterday trying
to read, or lying down dozing.  In the afternoon, Mr. Renfield
asked if he might see me.  Poor man, he was very gentle,
and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless me.
Some way it affected me much.  I am crying when I think of him.
This is a new weakness, of which I must be careful.
Jonathan would be miserable if he knew I had been crying.
He and the others were out till dinner time, and they all came
in tired.  I did what I could to brighten them up, and I suppose
that the effort did me good, for I forgot how tired I was.
After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to
smoke together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted
to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day.
I could see from Jonathan's manner that he had something important
to communicate.  I was not so sleepy as I should have been,
so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to give me a little
opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night before.
He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to me,
telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.
. .I have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still
keeps aloof.  I hope I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins
to flirt with me, a new fear comes, that I may have been
foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of waking.
I might want it.  Here comes sleep.  Goodnight.





CHAPTER 20


JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


1 October, evening.--I found Thomas Snelling in his house
at Bethnal Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition
to remember anything.  The very prospect of beer which my
expected coming had opened to him had proved too much,
and he had begun too early on his expected debauch.
I learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent,
poor soul, that he was only the assistant of Smollet,
who of the two mates was the responsible person.
So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph Smollet at home
and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a saucer.
He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good,
reliable type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own.
He remembered all about the incident of the boxes,
and from a wonderful dog-eared notebook, which he produced
from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of
his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,
half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes.
There were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from
Carfax and left at 197 Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town,
and another six which he deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey.
If then the Count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges
of his over London, these places were chosen as the first
of delivery, so that later he might distribute more fully.
The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that
he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London.
He was now fixed on the far east on the northern shore,
on the east of the southern shore, and on the south.
The north and west were surely never meant to be left out of
his diabolical scheme, let alone the City itself and the very
heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west.
I went back to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us
if any other boxes had been taken from Carfax.

He replied, ""Well guv'nor, you've treated me very 'an'some"", I
had given him half a sovereign, ""an I'll tell yer all I know.
I heard a man by the name of Bloxam say four nights ago
in the 'Are an' 'Ounds, in Pincher's Alley, as 'ow he an'
his mate 'ad 'ad a rare dusty job in a old 'ouse at Purfleet.
There ain't a many such jobs as this 'ere, an' I'm thinkin'
that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut.""

I asked if he could tell me where to find him.  I told him that if he could
get me the address it would be worth another half sovereign to him.
So he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up, saying that he was
going to begin the search then and there.

At the door he stopped, and said, ""Look 'ere, guv'nor, there ain't
no sense in me a keepin' you 'ere.  I may find Sam soon, or I mayn't,
but anyhow he ain't like to be in a way to tell ye much tonight.
Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.  If you can give
me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on it,
I'll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye tonight.
But ye'd better be up arter 'im soon in the mornin', never mind
the booze the night afore.""

This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny
to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change.
When she came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it,
and when Smollet had again faithfully promised to post the address
when found, I took my way to home.  We're on the track anyhow.
I am tired tonight, and I want to sleep.  Mina is fast asleep, and looks
a little too pale.  Her eyes look as though she had been crying.
Poor dear, I've no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark,
and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the others.
But it is best as it is.  It is better to be disappointed and worried
in such a way now than to have her nerve broken.  The doctors were quite
right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful business.
I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence must rest.
I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any circumstances.
Indeed, It may not be a hard task, after all, for she herself has
become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the Count
or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.


2 October, evening--A long and trying and exciting day.
By the first post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap
of paper enclosed, on which was written with a carpenter's pencil
in a sprawling hand, ""Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4 Poters Cort,
Bartel Street, Walworth.  Arsk for the depite.""

I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina.
She looked heavy and sleepy and pale, and far from well.
I determined not to wake her, but that when I should return from
this new search, I would arrange for her going back to Exeter.
I think she would be happier in our own home, with her
daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst
us and in ignorance.  I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment,
and told him where I was off to, promising to come back and
tell the rest so soon as I should have found out anything.
I drove to Walworth and found, with some difficulty, Potter's Court.
Mr. Smollet's spelling misled me, as I asked for Poter's Court
instead of Potter's Court.  However, when I had found the court,
I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran's lodging house.

When I asked the man who came to the door for the ""depite,"" he shook
his head, and said, ""I dunno 'im.  There ain't no such a person 'ere.
I never 'eard of 'im in all my bloomin' days.  Don't believe there ain't
nobody of that kind livin' 'ere or anywheres.""

I took out Smollet's letter, and as I read it it seemed to me that
the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me.
""What are you?""  I asked.

""I'm the depity,"" he answered.

I saw at once that I was on the right track.  Phonetic spelling
had again misled me.  A half crown tip put the deputy's
knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam,
who had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous
night at Corcoran's, had left for his work at Poplar at five
o'clock that morning.  He could not tell me where the place
of work was situated, but he had a vague idea that it was some
kind of a ""new-fangled ware'us,"" and with this slender clue
I had to start for Poplar.  It was twelve o'clock before I
got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this I got
at a coffee shop, where some workmen were having their dinner.
One of them suggested that there was being erected at Cross
Angel Street a new ""cold storage"" building, and as this suited
the condition of a ""new-fangled ware'us,"" I at once drove to it.
An interview with a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman,
both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm,
put me on the track of Bloxam.  He was sent for on my suggestion
that I was willing to pay his days wages to his foreman for
the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter.
He was a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing.
When I had promised to pay for his information and given him
an earnest, he told me that he had made two journeys between
Carfax and a house in Piccadilly, and had taken from this
house to the latter nine great boxes, ""main heavy ones,""
with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose.

I asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly,
to which he replied, ""Well, guv'nor, I forgits the number, but it was only
a few door from a big white church, or somethink of the kind, not long built.
It was a dusty old 'ouse, too, though nothin' to the dustiness of the 'ouse
we tooked the bloomin' boxes from.""

""How did you get in if both houses were empty?""

""There was the old party what engaged me a waitin' in the 'ouse at Purfleet.
He 'elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray.  Curse me,
but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an' him a old feller,
with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn't
throw a shadder.""

How this phrase thrilled through me!

""Why, 'e took up 'is end o' the boxes like they was pounds of tea,
and me a puffin' an' a blowin' afore I could upend mine anyhow, an'
I'm no chicken, neither.""

""How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?""  I asked.

""He was there too.  He must 'a started off and got there afore me,
for when I rung of the bell he kem an' opened the door 'isself an'
'elped me carry the boxes into the 'all.""

""The whole nine?""  I asked.

""Yus, there was five in the first load an' four in the second.
It was main dry work, an' I don't so well remember 'ow I got 'ome.""

I interrupted him, ""Were the boxes left in the hall?""

""Yus, it was a big 'all, an' there was nothin' else in it.""

I made one more attempt to further matters.  ""You didn't have any key?""

""Never used no key nor nothink.  The old gent, he opened
the door 'isself an' shut it again when I druv off.
I don't remember the last time, but that was the beer.""

""And you can't remember the number of the house?""

""No, sir.  But ye needn't have no difficulty about that.  It's a 'igh
'un with a stone front with a bow on it, an' 'igh steps up to the door.
I know them steps, 'avin' 'ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers
what come round to earn a copper.  The old gent give them shillin's, an'
they seein' they got so much, they wanted more.  But 'e took one of them
by the shoulder and was like to throw 'im down the steps, till the lot
of them went away cussin'.""

I thought that with this description I could find the house, so having
paid my friend for his information, I started off for Piccadilly.
I had gained a new painful experience.  The Count could, it was evident,
handle the earth boxes himself.  If so, time was precious,
for now that he had achieved a certain amount of distribution,
he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task unobserved.
At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked westward.
Beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house described and
was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by Dracula.
The house looked as though it had been long untenanted.
The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were up.
All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint
had mostly scaled away.  It was evident that up to lately
there had been a large notice board in front of the balcony.
It had, however, been roughly torn away, the uprights which had
supported it still remaining.  Behind the rails of the balcony I
saw there were some loose boards, whose raw edges looked white.
I would have given a good deal to have been able to see the notice
board intact, as it would, perhaps, have given some clue to the ownership
of the house.  I remembered my experience of the investigation
and purchase of Carfax, and I could not but feel that I could find
the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining
access to the house.

There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side,
and nothing could be done, so I went around to the back to see
if anything could be gathered from this quarter.  The mews
were active, the Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation.
I asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom I saw
around if they could tell me anything about the empty house.
One of them said that he heard it had lately been taken,
but he couldn't say from whom.  He told me, however, that up
to very lately there had been a notice board of ""For Sale""
up, and that perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy the house agents
could tell me something, as he thought he remembered seeing
the name of that firm on the board.  I did not wish to seem
too eager, or to let my informant know or guess too much,
so thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled away.
It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in,
so I did not lose any time.  Having learned the address
of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy from a directory at the Berkeley,
I was soon at their office in Sackville Street.

The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner,
but uncommunicative in equal proportion.  Having once told me
that the Piccadilly house, which throughout our interview he called
a ""mansion,"" was sold, he considered my business as concluded.
When I asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider,
and paused a few seconds before replying, ""It is sold, sir.""

""Pardon me,"" I said, with equal politeness, ""but I have a special
reason for wishing to know who purchased it.""

Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more.
""It is sold, sir,"" was again his laconic reply.

""Surely,"" I said, ""you do not mind letting me know so much.""

""But I do mind,"" he answered.  ""The affairs of their clients are absolutely
safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy.""

This was manifestly a prig of the first water, and there
was no use arguing with him.  I thought I had best meet him
on his own ground, so I said, ""Your clients, sir, are happy
in having so resolute a guardian of their confidence.
I am myself a professional man.""

Here I handed him my card.  ""In this instance I am not prompted
by curiosity, I act on the part of Lord Godalming, who wishes
to know something of the property which was, he understood,
lately for sale.""

These words put a different complexion on affairs.
He said, ""I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker,
and especially would I like to oblige his lordship.
We once carried out a small matter of renting some chambers
for him when he was the Honorable Arthur Holmwood.
If you will let me have his lordship's address I will
consult the House on the subject, and will, in any case,
communicate with his lordship by tonight's post.
It will be a pleasure if we can so far deviate from our rules
as to give the required information to his lordship.""

I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I
thanked him, gave the address at Dr. Seward's and came away.
It was now dark, and I was tired and hungry.  I got a cup
of tea at the Aerated Bread Company and came down to Purfleet
by the next train.

I found all the others at home.  Mina was looking tired and pale,
but she made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful.
It wrung my heart to think that I had had to keep anything
from her and so caused her inquietude.  Thank God, this will
be the last night of her looking on at our conferences,
and feeling the sting of our not showing our confidence.
It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of keeping
her out of our grim task.  She seems somehow more reconciled,
or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her,
for when any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders.
I am glad we made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling
as this, our growing knowledge would be torture to her.

I could not tell the others of the day's discovery till we were alone,
so after dinner, followed by a little music to save appearances even
amongst ourselves, I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.
The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung
to me as though she would detain me, but there was much to be talked
of and I came away.  Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made
no difference between us.

When I came down again I found the others all gathered round
the fire in the study.  In the train I had written my diary so far,
and simply read it off to them as the best means of letting them
get abreast of my own information.

When I had finished Van Helsing said, ""This has been a great day's work,
friend Jonathan.  Doubtless we are on the track of the missing boxes.
If we find them all in that house, then our work is near the end.
But if there be some missing, we must search until we find them.
Then shall we make our final coup, and hunt the wretch to his real death.""

We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr. Morris spoke, ""Say!
How are we going to get into that house?""

""We got into the other,"" answered Lord Godalming quickly.

""But, Art, this is different.  We broke house at Carfax, but we had
night and a walled park to protect us.  It will be a mighty different
thing to commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night.
I confess I don't see how we are going to get in unless that agency
duck can find us a key of some sort.""

Lord Godalming's brows contracted, and he stood up and walked about the room.
By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to another of us,
""Quincey's head is level.  This burglary business is getting serious.
We got off once all right, but we have now a rare job on hand.
Unless we can find the Count's key basket.""

As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at least
advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell's, we decided
not to take any active step before breakfast time.  For a good while we
sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and bearings.
I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the moment.
I am very sleepy and shall go to bed.  . .

Just a line.  Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular.  Her forehead
is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even in her sleep.
She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she did this morning.
Tomorrow will, I hope, mend all this.  She will be herself at home in Exeter.
Oh, but I am sleepy!




DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


1 October.--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield.
His moods change so rapidly that I find it difficult to keep
touch of them, and as they always mean something more than
his own well-being, they form a more than interesting study.
This morning, when I went to see him after his repulse of
Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.
He was, in fact, commanding destiny, subjectively.
He did not really care for any of the things of mere earth,
he was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses
and wants of us poor mortals.

I thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked him,
""What about the flies these times?""

He smiled on me in quite a superior sort of way, such a smile
as would have become the face of Malvolio, as he answered me,
""The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature.  It's wings
are typical of the aerial powers of the psychic faculties.
The ancients did well when they typified the soul as a butterfly!""

I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said quickly,
""Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?""

His madness foiled his reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as,
shaking his head with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him.

He said, ""Oh, no, oh no!  I want no souls.  Life is all I want.""
Here he brightened up.  ""I am pretty indifferent about it at present.
Life is all right.  I have all I want.  You must get a new patient,
doctor, if you wish to study zoophagy!""

This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on.  ""Then you command life.
You are a god, I suppose?""

He smiled with an ineffably benign superiority.  ""Oh no!
Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the Deity.
I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings.
If I may state my intellectual position I am, so far as
concerns things purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position
which Enoch occupied spiritually!""

This was a poser to me.  I could not at the moment recall
Enoch's appositeness, so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt
that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic.
""And why with Enoch?""

""Because he walked with God.""

I could not see the analogy, but did not like to admit it,
so I harked back to what he had denied.  ""So you don't
care about life and you don't want souls.  Why not?""
I put my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose
to disconcert him.

The effort succeeded, for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his
old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me
as he replied.  ""I don't want any souls, indeed, indeed!  I don't. I
couldn't use them if I had them.  They would be no manner of use to me.
I couldn't eat them or.  . .""

He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his face,
like a wind sweep on the surface of the water.

""And doctor, as to life, what is it after all?  When you've
got all you require, and you know that you will never want,
that is all.  I have friends, good friends, like you,
Dr. Seward.""This was said with a leer of inexpressible cunning.
""I know that I shall never lack the means of life!""

I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw
some antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last
refuge of such as he, a dogged silence.  After a short time
I saw that for the present it was useless to speak to him.
He was sulky, and so I came away.

Later in the day he sent for me.  Ordinarily I would not
have come without special reason, but just at present I am
so interested in him that I would gladly make an effort.
Besides, I am glad to have anything to help pass the time.
Harker is out, following up clues, and so are Lord Godalming
and Quincey.  Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the record
prepared by the Harkers.  He seems to think that by accurate
knowledge of all details he will light up on some clue.
He does not wish to be disturbed in the work, without cause.
I would have taken him with me to see the patient, only I thought
that after his last repulse he might not care to go again.
There was also another reason.  Renfield might not speak
so freely before a third person as when he and I were alone.

I found him sitting in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose
which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part.
When I came in, he said at once, as though the question had been
waiting on his lips.  ""What about souls?""

It was evident then that my surmise had been correct.
Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the lunatic.
I determined to have the matter out.

""What about them yourself?""  I asked.

He did not reply for a moment but looked all around him, and up and down,
as though he expected to find some inspiration for an answer.

""I don't want any souls!""  He said in a feeble, apologetic way.
The matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it,
to ""be cruel only to be kind.""  So I said, ""You like life,
and you want life?""

""Oh yes!  But that is all right.  You needn't worry about that!""

""But,"" I asked, ""how are we to get the life without getting
the soul also?""

This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up, ""A nice
time you'll have some time when you're flying out here,
with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds
and cats buzzing and twittering and moaning all around you.
You've got their lives, you know, and you must put up
with their souls!""

Something seemed to affect his imagination, for he put his
fingers to his ears and shut his eyes, screwing them up tightly
just as a small boy does when his face is being soaped.
There was something pathetic in it that touched me.
It also gave me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child,
only a child, though the features were worn, and the stubble
on the jaws was white.  It was evident that he was undergoing
some process of mental disturbance, and knowing how his past
moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself,
I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could
and go with him

The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him,
speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears,
""Would you like some sugar to get your flies around again?""

He seemed to wake up all at once, and shook his head.
With a laugh he replied, ""Not much!  Flies are poor things,
after all!""  After a pause he added, ""But I don't want their
souls buzzing round me, all the same.""

""Or spiders?""  I went on.

""Blow spiders!  What's the use of spiders?  There isn't anything
in them to eat or.  . ."" He stopped suddenly as though reminded
of a forbidden topic.

""So, so!""  I thought to myself, ""this is the second time he has
suddenly stopped at the word `drink'. What does it mean?""

Renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse,
for he hurried on, as though to distract my attention
from it, ""I don't take any stock at all in such matters.
`Rats and mice and such small deer,' as Shakespeare has it,
`chicken feed of the larder' they might be called.
I'm past all that sort of nonsense.  You might as well ask
a man to eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks, as to try
to interest me about the less carnivora, when I know of what
is before me.""

""I see,"" I said.""You want big things that you can make your teeth meet in?
How would you like to breakfast on an elephant?""

""What ridiculous nonsense you are talking?""  He was getting too wide awake,
so I thought I would press him hard.

""I wonder,"" I said reflectively, ""what an elephant's soul is like!""

The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his high-horse
and became a child again.

""I don't want an elephant's soul, or any soul at all!"" he said.
For a few moments he sat despondently.  Suddenly he jumped to his feet,
with his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement.
""To hell with you and your souls!"" he shouted.  ""Why do you plague me
about souls?  Haven't I got enough to worry, and pain, to distract
me already, without thinking of souls?""

He looked so hostile that I thought he was in for another homicidal fit,
so I blew my whistle.

The instant, however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically,
""Forgive me, Doctor.  I forgot myself.  You do not need any help.
I am so worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable.  If you only knew
the problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity,
and tolerate, and pardon me.  Pray do not put me in a strait waistcoat.
I want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined.
I am sure you will understand!""

He had evidently self-control, so when the attendants came I told
them not to mind, and they withdrew.  Renfield watched them go.
When the door was closed he said with considerable dignity
and sweetness, ""Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me.
Believe me that I am very, very grateful to you!""

I thought it well to leave him in this mood, and so I came away.
There is certainly something to ponder over in this man's state.
Several points seem to make what the American interviewer
calls ""a story,"" if one could only get them in proper order.
Here they are:

Will not mention ""drinking.""

Fears the thought of being burdened with the ""soul"" of anything.

Has no dread of wanting ""life"" in the future.

Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being haunted
by their souls.

Logically all these things point one way!  He has assurance
of some kind that he will acquire some higher life.

He dreads the consequence, the burden of a soul.
Then it is a human life he looks to!

And the assurance.  . .?

Merciful God!  The Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme
of terror afoot!


Later.--I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him
my suspicion.  He grew very grave, and after thinking the matter
over for a while asked me to take him to Renfield.  I did so.
As we came to the door we heard the lunatic within singing gaily,
as he used to do in the time which now seems so long ago.

When we entered we saw with amazement that he had spread out
his sugar as of old.  The flies, lethargic with the autumn,
were beginning to buzz into the room.  We tried to make him talk
of the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend.
He went on with his singing, just as though we had not been present.
He had got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a notebook.
We had to come away as ignorant as we went in.

His is a curious case indeed.  We must watch him tonight.





LETTER, MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY TO LORD GODALMING.


""1 October.

""My Lord,

""We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes.
We beg, with regard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by
Mr. Harker on your behalf, to supply the following information
concerning the sale and purchase of No. 347, Piccadilly.
The original vendors are the executors of the late Mr. Archibald
Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign nobleman,
Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying
the purchase money in notes `over the counter,' if your
Lordship will pardon us using so vulgar an expression.
Beyond this we know nothing whatever of him.

""We are, my Lord,

""Your Lordship's humble servants,

""MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY.""




DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


2 October.--I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to make
an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield's room, and gave
him instructions that if there should be anything strange he was to call me.
After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire in the study,
Mrs. Harker having gone to bed, we discussed the attempts and discoveries
of the day.  Harker was the only one who had any result, and we are in great
hopes that his clue may be an important one.

Before going to bed I went round to the patient's room and looked
in through the observation trap.  He was sleeping soundly,
his heart rose and fell with regular respiration.

This morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after
midnight he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly.
I asked him if that was all.  He replied that it was all he heard.
There was something about his manner, so suspicious
that I asked him point blank if he had been asleep.
He denied sleep, but admitted to having ""dozed"" for a while.
It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are watched.

Today Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey
are looking after horses.  Godalming thinks that it will be
well to have horses always in readiness, for when we get
the information which we seek there will be no time to lose.
We must sterilize all the imported earth between sunrise and sunset.
We shall thus catch the Count at his weakest, and without
a refuge to fly to.  Van Helsing is off to the British
Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine.
The old physicians took account of things which their followers
do not accept, and the Professor is searching for witch
and demon cures which may be useful to us later.

I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity
in strait waistcoats.

Later.--We have met again.  We seem at last to be on the track,
and our work of tomorrow may be the beginning of the end.
I wonder if Renfield's quiet has anything to do with this.
His moods have so followed the doings of the Count, that the coming
destruction of the monster may be carried to him some subtle way.
If we could only get some hint as to what passed in his mind,
between the time of my argument with him today and his
resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a valuable clue.
He is now seemingly quiet for a spell.  . . Is he?
That wild yell seemed to come from his room.  . .

The attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had
somehow met with some accident.  He had heard him yell, and when he went
to him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood.
I must go at once.  . .





CHAPTER 21


DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


3 October.--Let me put down with exactness all that happened,
as well as I can remember, since last I made an entry.
Not a detail that I can recall must be forgotten.
In all calmness I must proceed.

When I came to Renfield's room I found him lying on the floor on his
left side in a glittering pool of blood.  When I went to move him,
it became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries.
There seemed none of the unity of purpose between the parts of the body
which marks even lethargic sanity.  As the face was exposed I could see
that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the floor.
Indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood originated.

The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we
turned him over, ""I think, sir, his back is broken.  See, both his
right arm and leg and the whole side of his face are paralysed.""
How such a thing could have happened puzzled the attendant
beyond measure.  He seemed quite bewildered, and his brows were
gathered in as he said, ""I can't understand the two things.
He could mark his face like that by beating his own head on the floor.
I saw a young woman do it once at the Eversfield Asylum before
anyone could lay hands on her.  And I suppose he might have broken
his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward kink.
But for the life of me I can't imagine how the two things occurred.
If his back was broke, he couldn't beat his head, and if his face was
like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of it.""

I said to him, ""Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come
here at once.  I want him without an instant's delay.""

The man ran off, and within a few minutes the Professor, in his
dressing gown and slippers, appeared.  When he saw Renfield on
the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and then turned to me.
I think he recognized my thought in my eyes, for he said very quietly,
manifestly for the ears of the attendant, ""Ah, a sad accident!
He will need very careful watching, and much attention.
I shall stay with you myself, but I shall first dress myself.
If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.""

The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see
that he had suffered some terrible injury.

Van Helsing returned with extraordinary celerity,
bearing with him a surgical case.  He had evidently been
thinking and had his mind made up, for almost before he looked
at the patient, he whispered to me, ""Send the attendant away.
We must be alone with him when he becomes conscious,
after the operation.""

I said, ""I think that will do now, Simmons.  We have done all that we can
at present.  You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.
Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.""

The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.
The wounds of the face were superficial.  The real injury was a depressed
fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area.

The Professor thought a moment and said, ""We must reduce
the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far as can be.
The rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature
of his injury.  The whole motor area seems affected.
The suffusion of the brain will increase quickly, so we must
trephine at once or it may be too late.""

As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door.
I went over and opened it and found in the corridor without,
Arthur and Quincey in pajamas and slippers, the former spoke, ""I heard
your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.
So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep.
Things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound
sleep for any of us these times.  I've been thinking
that tomorrow night will not see things as they have been.
We'll have to look back, and forward a little more than we have done.
May we come in?""

I nodded, and held the door open till they had entered, then I closed
it again.  When Quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient,
and noted the horrible pool on the floor, he said softly, ""My God!
What has happened to him?  Poor, poor devil!""

I told him briefly, and added that we expected he would recover
consciousness after the operation, for a short time, at all events.
He went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming
beside him.  We all watched in patience.

""We shall wait,"" said Van Helsing, ""just long enough to fix the best
spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove
the blood clot, for it is evident that the haemorrhage is increasing.""

The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness.
I had a horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing's
face I gathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to
what was to come.  I dreaded the words Renfield might speak.
I was positively afraid to think.  But the conviction of what
was coming was on me, as I have read of men who have heard
the death watch.  The poor man's breathing came in uncertain gasps.
Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes and speak,
but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he would
relapse into a more fixed insensibility.  Inured as I was
to sick beds and death, this suspense grew and grew upon me.
I could almost hear the beating of my own heart, and the blood
surging through my temples sounded like blows from a hammer.
The silence finally became agonizing.  I looked at my companions,
one after another, and saw from their flushed faces
and damp brows that they were enduring equal torture.
There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead
some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should
least expect it.

At last there came a time when it was evident that the
patient was sinking fast.  He might die at any moment.
I looked up at the Professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine.
His face was sternly set as he spoke, ""There is no time to lose.
His words may be worth many lives.  I have been thinking so,
as I stood here.  It may be there is a soul at stake!
We shall operate just above the ear.""

Without another word he made the operation.  For a few moments
the breathing continued to be stertorous.  Then there came a breath
so prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.
Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.
This was continued for a few moments, then it was softened
into a glad surprise, and from his lips came a sigh of relief.
He moved convulsively, and as he did so, said, ""I'll be quiet, Doctor.
Tell them to take off the strait waistcoat.  I have had a terrible dream,
and it has left me so weak that I cannot move.  What's wrong with my face?
It feels all swollen, and it smarts dreadfully.""

He tried to turn his head, but even with the effort his
eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back.
Then Van Helsing said in a quiet grave tone, ""Tell us
your dream, Mr. Renfield.""

As he heard the voice his face brightened, through its mutilation,
and he said, ""That is Dr. Van Helsing.  How good it is of you to be here.
Give me some water, my lips are dry, and I shall try to tell you.
I dreamed"". . .

He stopped and seemed fainting.  I called quietly to Quincey,
""The brandy, it is in my study, quick!""  He flew and returned
with a glass, the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water.
We moistened the parched lips, and the patient quickly revived.

It seemed, however, that his poor injured brain had been working
in the interval, for when he was quite conscious, he looked at me
piercingly with an agonized confusion which I shall never forget,
and said, ""I must not deceive myself.  It was no dream,
but all a grim reality.""  Then his eyes roved round the room.
As they caught sight of the two figures sitting patiently on
the edge of the bed he went on, ""If I were not sure already,
I would know from them.""

For an instant his eyes closed, not with pain or sleep but
voluntarily, as though he were bringing all his faculties to bear.
When he opened them he said, hurriedly, and with more energy
than he had yet displayed, ""Quick, Doctor, quick, I am dying!
I feel that I have but a few minutes, and then I must go
back to death, or worse!  Wet my lips with brandy again.
I have something that I must say before I die.  Or before my
poor crushed brain dies anyhow.  Thank you!  It was that night
after you left me, when I implored you to let me go away.
I couldn't speak then, for I felt my tongue was tied.
But I was as sane then, except in that way, as I am now.
I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left me,
it seemed hours.  Then there came a sudden peace to me.
My brain seemed to become cool again, and I realized where I was.
I heard the dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!""

As he spoke, Van Helsing's eyes never blinked, but his hand came out
and met mine and gripped it hard.  He did not, however, betray himself.
He nodded slightly and said, ""Go on,"" in a low voice.

Renfield proceeded.  ""He came up to the window in the mist,
as I had seen him often before, but he was solid then,
not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a man's when angry.
He was laughing with his red mouth, the sharp white teeth
glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back
over the belt of trees, to where the dogs were barking.
I wouldn't ask him to come in at first, though I knew he wanted to,
just as he had wanted all along.  Then he began promising
me things, not in words but by doing them.""

He was interrupted by a word from the Professor, ""How?""

""By making them happen.  Just as he used to send in the flies when the sun
was shining.  Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their wings.
And big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their backs.""

Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously,
""The Acherontia Atropos of the Sphinges, what you call
the `Death's-head Moth'?""

The patient went on without stopping, ""Then he began to
whisper.`Rats, rats, rats!  Hundreds, thousands, millions of them,
and every one a life.  And dogs to eat them, and cats too.  All lives!
All red blood, with years of life in it, and not merely buzzing flies!'
I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.
Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house.
He beckoned me to the window.  I got up and looked out, and He
raised his hands, and seemed to call out without using any words.
A dark mass spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a
flame of fire.  And then He moved the mist to the right and left,
and I could see that there were thousands of rats with their
eyes blazing red, like His only smaller.  He held up his hand,
and they all stopped, and I thought he seemed to be saying,
`All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more and greater,
through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship me!'
And then a red cloud, like the color of blood, seemed to close
over my eyes, and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself
opening the sash and saying to Him, `Come in, Lord and Master!'
The rats were all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash,
though it was only open an inch wide, just as the Moon herself has
often come in through the tiniest crack and has stood before me
in all her size and splendor.""

His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again,
and he continued, but it seemed as though his memory had gone
on working in the interval for his story was further advanced.
I was about to call him back to the point, but Van Helsing
whispered to me, ""Let him go on.  Do not interrupt him.
He cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all if once
he lost the thread of his thought.""

He proceeded, ""All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send
me anything, not even a blowfly, and when the moon got up I was pretty
angry with him.  When he did slide in through the window, though it
was shut, and did not even knock, I got mad with him.  He sneered at me,
and his white face looked out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming,
and he went on as though he owned the whole place, and I was no one.
He didn't even smell the same as he went by me.  I couldn't hold him.
I thought that, somehow, Mrs. Harker had come into the room.""

The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind
him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.
They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered.
His face, however, grew grimmer and sterner still.  Renfield went on
without noticing, ""When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she
wasn't the same.  It was like tea after the teapot has been watered.""
Here we all moved, but no one said a word.

He went on, ""I didn't know that she was here till she spoke,
and she didn't look the same.  I don't care for the pale people.
I like them with lots of blood in them, and hers all seemed
to have run out.  I didn't think of it at the time,
but when she went away I began to think, and it made me
mad to know that He had been taking the life out of her.""
I could feel that the rest quivered, as I did.  But we remained
otherwise still.  ""So when He came tonight I was ready for Him.
I saw the mist stealing in, and I grabbed it tight.  I had heard
that madmen have unnatural strength.  And as I knew I was a madman,
at times anyhow, I resolved to use my power.  Ay, and He felt
it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle with me.
I held tight, and I thought I was going to win, for I didn't
mean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes.
They burned into me, and my strength became like water.
He slipped through it, and when I tried to cling to Him,
He raised me up and flung me down.  There was a red cloud before me,
and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed to steal away
under the door.""

His voice was becoming fainter and his breath more stertorous.
Van Helsing stood up instinctively.

""We know the worst now,"" he said.  ""He is here, and we know his purpose.
It may not be too late.  Let us be armed, the same as we were the other night,
but lose no time, there is not an instant to spare.""

There was no need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words,
we shared them in common.  We all hurried and took from our rooms
the same things that we had when we entered the Count's house.
The Professor had his ready, and as we met in the corridor
he pointed to them significantly as he said, ""They never leave me,
and they shall not till this unhappy business is over.
Be wise also, my friends.  It is no common enemy that we deal
with Alas!  Alas!  That dear Madam Mina should suffer!""
He stopped, his voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage
or terror predominated in my own heart.

Outside the Harkers' door we paused.  Art and Quincey held back,
and the latter said, ""Should we disturb her?""

""We must,"" said Van Helsing grimly.  ""If the door be locked,
I shall break it in.""

""May it not frighten her terribly?  It is unusual to break
into a lady's room!""

Van Helsing said solemnly, ""You are always right.
But this is life and death.  All chambers are alike to the doctor.
And even were they not they are all as one to me tonight.
Friend John, when I turn the handle, if the door does not open,
do you put your shoulder down and shove.  And you too,
my friends.  Now!""

He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield.
We threw ourselves against it.  With a crash it burst open,
and we almost fell headlong into the room.  The Professor
did actually fall, and I saw across him as he gathered
himself up from hands and knees.  What I saw appalled me.
I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,
and my heart seemed to stand still.

The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room
was light enough to see.  On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan Harker,
his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.
Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad
figure of his wife.  By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.
His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognized
the Count, in every way, even to the scar on his forehead.
With his left hand he held both Mrs. Harker's hands, keeping them
away with her arms at full tension.  His right hand gripped her
by the back of the neck, forcing her face down on his bosom.
Her white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled
down the man's bare chest which was shown by his torn-open dress.
The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing
a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink.
As we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and the
hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap into it.
His eyes flamed red with devilish passion.  The great nostrils
of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge,
and the white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood
dripping mouth, clamped together like those of a wild beast.
With a wrench, which threw his victim back upon the bed
as though hurled from a height, he turned and sprang at us.
But by this time the Professor had gained his feet, and was holding
towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred Wafer.
The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside the tomb,
and cowered back.  Further and further back he cowered, as we,
lifting our crucifixes, advanced.  The moonlight suddenly failed,
as a great black cloud sailed across the sky.  And when the gaslight
sprang up under Quincey's match, we saw nothing but a faint vapor.
This, as we looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil
from its bursting open, had swung back to its old position.
Van Helsing, Art, and I moved forward to Mrs. Harker,
who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given
a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it seems
to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day.
For a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray.
Her face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood
which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin.  From her throat
trickled a thin stream of blood.  Her eyes were mad with terror.
Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which bore
on their whiteness the red mark of the Count's terrible grip,
and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible
scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief.
Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body,
whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant despairingly,
ran out of the room.

Van Helsing whispered to me, ""Jonathan is in a stupor such as we
know the Vampire can produce.  We can do nothing with poor
Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers herself.
I must wake him!""

He dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it began
to flick him on the face, his wife all the while holding her face
between her hands and sobbing in a way that was heart breaking
to hear.  I raised the blind, and looked out of the window.
There was much moonshine, and as I looked I could see Quincey
Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a
great yew tree.  It puzzled me to think why he was doing this.
But at the instant I heard Harker's quick exclamation
as he woke to partial consciousness, and turned to the bed.
On his face, as there might well be, was a look of wild amazement.
He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and then full consciousness
seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he started up.

His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to him with her arms
stretched out, as though to embrace him.  Instantly, however, she drew them
in again, and putting her elbows together, held her hands before her face,
and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.

""In God's name what does this mean?""  Harker cried out.
""Dr. Seward, Dr. Van Helsing, what is it?  What has happened?
What is wrong?  Mina, dear what is it?  What does that blood mean?
My God, my God!  Has it come to this!""  And, raising himself
to his knees, he beat his hands wildly together.""Good God help us!
Help her!  Oh, help her!""

With a quick movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on
his clothes, all the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion.
""What has happened?  Tell me all about it!"" he cried without pausing.
""Dr. Van Helsing you love Mina, I know.  Oh, do something to save her.
It cannot have gone too far yet.  Guard her while I look for him!""

His wife, through her terror and horror and distress,
saw some sure danger to him.  Instantly forgetting her own grief,
she seized hold of him and cried out.

""No!  No!  Jonathan, you must not leave me.  I have suffered enough tonight,
God knows, without the dread of his harming you.  You must stay with me.
Stay with these friends who will watch over you!""  Her expression became
frantic as she spoke.  And, he yielding to her, she pulled him down sitting
on the bedside, and clung to him fiercely.

Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both.  The Professor held up his
golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness, ""Do not fear, my dear.
We are here, and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can approach.
You are safe for tonight, and we must be calm and take counsel together.""

She shuddered and was silent, holding down her head on her husband's breast.
When she raised it, his white nightrobe was stained with blood where her lips
had touched, and where the thin open wound in the neck had sent forth drops.
The instant she saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered,
amidst choking sobs.

""Unclean, unclean!  I must touch him or kiss him no more.
Oh, that it should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy,
and whom he may have most cause to fear.""

To this he spoke out resolutely, ""Nonsense, Mina.  It is a shame
to me to hear such a word.  I would not hear it of you.
And I shall not hear it from you.  May God judge me by my deserts,
and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,
if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!""

He put out his arms and folded her to his breast.  And for a while
she lay there sobbing.  He looked at us over her bowed head,
with eyes that blinked damply above his quivering nostrils.
His mouth was set as steel.

After a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint,
and then he said to me, speaking with a studied calmness
which I felt tried his nervous power to the utmost.

""And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it.  Too well I know the broad fact.
Tell me all that has been.""

I told him exactly what had happened and he listened with seeming
impassiveness, but his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed as I told
how the ruthless hands of the Count had held his wife in that terrible
and horrid position, with her mouth to the open wound in his breast.
It interested me, even at that moment, to see that whilst the face
of white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head,
the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair.
Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.
They entered in obedience to our summons.  Van Helsing looked
at me questioningly.  I understood him to mean if we were to take
advantage of their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of
the unhappy husband and wife from each other and from themselves.
So on nodding acquiescence to him he asked them what they had seen
or done.  To which Lord Godalming answered.

""I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms.
I looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone.
He had, however.  . ."" He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping
figure on the bed.

Van Helsing said gravely, ""Go on, friend Arthur.  We want
here no more concealments.  Our hope now is in knowing all.
Tell freely!""

So Art went on, ""He had been there, and though it could only have been
for a few seconds, he made rare hay of the place.  All the manuscript had
been burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes.
The cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax
had helped the flames.""

Here I interrupted.  ""Thank God there is the other copy in the safe!""

His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he went on.
""I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him.
I looked into Renfield's room, but there was no trace there except.
. ."" Again he paused.

""Go on,"" said Harker hoarsely.  So he bowed his head and moistening his lips
with his tongue, added, ""except that the poor fellow is dead.""

Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of us
she said solemnly, ""God's will be done!""

I could not but feel that Art was keeping back something.
But, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.

Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked, ""And you, friend Quincey,
have you any to tell?""

""A little,"" he answered.  ""It may be much eventually,
but at present I can't say.  I thought it well to know
if possible where the Count would go when he left the house.
I did not see him, but I saw a bat rise from Renfield's window,
and flap westward.  I expected to see him in some shape go
back to Carfax, but he evidently sought some other lair.
He will not be back tonight, for the sky is reddening in the east,
and the dawn is close.  We must work tomorrow!""

He said the latter words through his shut teeth.  For a space
of perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could
fancy that I could hear the sound of our hearts beating.

Then Van Helsing said, placing his hand tenderly on Mrs. Harker's head,
""And now, Madam Mina, poor dear, dear, Madam Mina, tell us exactly
what happened.  God knows that I do not want that you be pained,
but it is need that we know all.  For now more than ever has
all work to be done quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest.
The day is close to us that must end all, if it may be so,
and now is the chance that we may live and learn.""

The poor dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves
as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower
and lower still on his breast.  Then she raised her head proudly,
and held out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his,
and after stooping and kissing it reverently, held it fast.
The other hand was locked in that of her husband, who held
his other arm thrown round her protectingly.  After a pause
in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she began.

""I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me,
but for a long time it did not act.  I seemed to become more wakeful,
and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind.
All of them connected with death, and vampires, with blood,
and pain, and trouble.""  Her husband involuntarily groaned
as she turned to him and said lovingly, ""Do not fret, dear.
You must be brave and strong, and help me through the horrible task.
If you only knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful
thing at all, you would understand how much I need your help.
Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work with my will,
if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to sleep.
Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no more.
Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when
next I remember.  There was in the room the same thin white mist
that I had before noticed.  But I forget now if you know of this.
You will find it in my diary which I shall show you later.
I felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and the same
sense of some presence.  I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that
he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken
the sleeping draught, and not I. I tried, but I could not wake him.
This caused me a great fear, and I looked around terrified.
Then indeed, my heart sank within me.  Beside the bed, as if he had
stepped out of the mist, or rather as if the mist had turned into
his figure, for it had entirely disappeared, stood a tall, thin man,
all in black.  I knew him at once from the description of the others.
The waxen face, the high aquiline nose, on which the light fell
in a thin white line, the parted red lips, with the sharp white
teeth showing between, and the red eyes that I had seemed to see
in the sunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Witby.
I knew, too, the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him.
For an instant my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out,
only that I was paralyzed.  In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen,
cutting whisper, pointing as he spoke to Jonathan.

""`Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his
brains out before your very eyes.'  I was appalled and was
too bewildered to do or say anything.  With a mocking smile,
he placed one hand upon my shoulder and, holding me tight,
bared my throat with the other, saying as he did so,
`First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions.
You may as well be quiet.  It is not the first time,
or the second, that your veins have appeased my thirst!'
I was bewildered, and strangely enough, I did not want to hinder him.
I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that such is,
when his touch is on his victim.  And oh, my God, my God,
pity me!  He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!""
Her husband groaned again.  She clasped his hand harder,
and looked at him pityingly, as if he were the injured one,
and went on.

""I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon.
How long this horrible thing lasted I know not, but it seemed
that a long time must have passed before he took his foul, awful,
sneering mouth away.  I saw it drip with the fresh blood!""The
remembrance seemed for a while to overpower her, and she drooped
and would have sunk down but for her husband's sustaining arm.
With a great effort she recovered herself and went on.

""Then he spoke to me mockingly, `And so you, like the others,
would play your brains against mine.  You would help
these men to hunt me and frustrate me in my design!
You know now, and they know in part already, and will
know in full before long, what it is to cross my path.
They should have kept their energies for use closer to home.
Whilst they played wits against me, against me who commanded nations,
and intrigued for them, and fought for them, hundreds of
years before they were born, I was countermining them.
And you, their best beloved one, are now to me, flesh of my flesh,
blood of my blood, kin of my kin, my bountiful wine-press
for a while, and shall be later on my companion and my helper.
You shall be avenged in turn, for not one of them but shall
minister to your needs.  But as yet you are to be punished
for what you have done.  You have aided in thwarting me.
Now you shall come to my call.  When my brain says ""Come!""
to you, you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding.
And to that end this!'

With that he pulled open his shirt, and with his long sharp nails
opened a vein in his breast.  When the blood began to spurt out,
he took my hands in one of his, holding them tight, and with the other
seized my neck and pressed my mouth to the wound, so that I must
either suffocate or swallow some to the.  . .Oh, my God!  My God!
What have I done?  What have I done to deserve such a fate,
I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days.
God pity me!  Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril.
And in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!""  Then she began to rub
her lips as though to cleanse them from pollution.

As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,
and everything became more and more clear.  Harker was still and quiet.
But over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look
which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first red
streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out against
the whitening hair.

We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy
pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.

Of this I am sure.  The sun rises today on no more miserable
house in all the great round of its daily course.





CHAPTER 22


JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


3 October.--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary.
It is now six o'clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour
and take something to eat, for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed
that if we do not eat we cannot work our best.  Our best will be,
God knows, required today.  I must keep writing at every chance,
for I dare not stop to think.  All, big and little, must go down.
Perhaps at the end the little things may teach us most.
The teaching, big or little, could not have landed Mina or me
anywhere worse than we are today.  However, we must trust and hope.
Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears running down her dear cheeks,
that it is in trouble and trial that our faith is tested.
That we must keep on trusting, and that God will aid us up to the end.
The end!  Oh my God!  What end?. . . To work!  To work!

When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor Renfield,
we went gravely into what was to be done.  First, Dr. Seward told us that when
he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below they had found Renfield
lying on the floor, all in a heap.  His face was all bruised and crushed in,
and the bones of the neck were broken.

Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had
heard anything.  He said that he had been sitting down, he confessed
to half dozing, when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield
had called out loudly several times, ""God!  God!  God!""  After that
there was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found
him lying on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him.
Van Helsing asked if he had heard ""voices"" or ""a voice,"" and he said
he could not say.  That at first it had seemed to him as if there were two,
but as there was no one in the room it could have been only one.
He could swear to it, if required, that the word ""God"" was spoken
by the patient.

Dr. Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go
into the matter.  The question of an inquest had to be considered,
and it would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it.
As it was, he thought that on the attendant's evidence he could
give a certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed.
In case the coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest,
necessarily to the same result.

When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next step,
the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full confidence.
That nothing of any sort, no matter how painful, should be kept from her.
She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful to see her so brave
and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of despair.

""There must be no concealment,"" she said.  ""Alas!  We have had too
much already.  And besides there is nothing in all the world that can
give me more pain than I have already endured, than I suffer now!
Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!""

Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said,
suddenly but quietly, ""But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid.
Not for yourself, but for others from yourself, after what has happened?""

Her face grew set in its lines, but her eyes shone
with the devotion of a martyr as she answered, ""Ah no!
For my mind is made up!""

""To what?"" he asked gently, whilst we were all very still, for each in our own
way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant.

Her answer came with direct simplicity, as though she was simply stating
a fact, ""Because if I find in myself, and I shall watch keenly for it,
a sign of harm to any that I love, I shall die!""

""You would not kill yourself?"" he asked, hoarsely.

""I would.  If there were no friend who loved me,
who would save me such a pain, and so desperate an effort!""
She looked at him meaningly as she spoke.

He was sitting down, but now he rose and came close
to her and put his hand on her head as he said solemnly.
""My child, there is such an one if it were for your good.
For myself I could hold it in my account with God to find such
an euthanasia for you, even at this moment if it were best.
Nay, were it safe!  But my child.  . .""

For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his throat.
He gulped it down and went on, ""There are here some who would
stand between you and death.  You must not die.  You must not
die by any hand, but least of all your own.  Until the other,
who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not die.
For if he is still with the quick Undead, your death would
make you even as he is.  No, you must live!  You must struggle
and strive to live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable.
You must fight Death himself, though he come to you in pain
or in joy.  By the day, or the night, in safety or in peril!
On your living soul I charge you that you do not die.
Nay, nor think of death, till this great evil be past.""

The poor dear grew white as death, and shook and shivered,
as I have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming
of the tide.  We were all silent.  We could do nothing.
At length she grew more calm and turning to him said sweetly,
but oh so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand, ""I promise you,
my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall strive
to do so.  Till, if it may be in His good time, this horror
may have passed away from me.""

She was so good and brave that we all felt that our hearts were strengthened
to work and endure for her, and we began to discuss what we were to do.
I told her that she was to have all the papers in the safe, and all the papers
or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use, and was to keep the record
as she had done before.  She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do,
if ""pleased"" could be used in connection with so grim an interest.

As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else,
and was prepared with an exact ordering of our work.

""It is perhaps well,"" he said, ""that at our meeting after our visit to
Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth boxes that lay there.
Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and would
doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort
with regard to the others.  But now he does not know our intentions.
Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a power exists
to us as can sterilize his lairs, so that he cannot use them as of old.

""We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as to their
disposition that, when we have examined the house in Piccadilly, we may track
the very last of them.  Today then, is ours, and in it rests our hope.
The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course.
Until it sets tonight, that monster must retain whatever form he now has.
He is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope.  He cannot
melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies.
If he go through a doorway, he must open the door like a mortal.
And so we have this day to hunt out all his lairs and sterilize them.
So we shall, if we have not yet catch him and destroy him, drive him
to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be,
in time, sure.""

Here I started up for I could not contain myself at the thought that
the minutes and seconds so preciously laden with Mina's life and happiness
were flying from us, since whilst we talked action was impossible.
But Van Helsing held up his hand warningly.

""Nay, friend Jonathan,"" he said, ""in this, the quickest way
home is the longest way, so your proverb say.  We shall all
act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come.
But think, in all probable the key of the situation is in that house
in Piccadilly.  The Count may have many houses which he has bought.
Of them he will have deeds of purchase, keys and other things.
He will have paper that he write on.  He will have his book of cheques.
There are many belongings that he must have somewhere.
Why not in this place so central, so quiet, where he come and go by
the front or the back at all hours, when in the very vast of the traffic
there is none to notice.  We shall go there and search that house.
And when we learn what it holds, then we do what our friend Arthur call,
in his phrases of hunt `stop the earths' and so we run down our
old fox, so?  Is it not?""

""Then let us come at once,"" I cried, ""we are wasting
the precious, precious time!""

The Professor did not move, but simply said, ""And how are we
to get into that house in Piccadilly?""

""Any way!""  I cried.  ""We shall break in if need be.""

""And your police?  Where will they be, and what will they say?""

I was staggered, but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good reason
for it.  So I said, as quietly as I could, ""Don't wait more than need be.
You know, I am sure, what torture I am in.""

""Ah, my child, that I do.  And indeed there is no wish of me
to add to your anguish.  But just think, what can we do,
until all the world be at movement.  Then will come our time.
I have thought and thought, and it seems to me that the simplest
way is the best of all.  Now we wish to get into the house,
but we have no key.  Is it not so?""  I nodded.

""Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could not
still get in.  And think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker,
what would you do?""

""I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick
the lock for me.""

""And your police, they would interfere, would they not?""

""Oh no!  Not if they knew the man was properly employed.""

""Then,"" he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, ""all that is in doubt
is the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen
as to whether or not that employer has a good conscience or a bad one.
Your police must indeed be zealous men and clever, oh so clever,
in reading the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter.
No, no, my friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred
empty houses in this your London, or of any city in the world,
and if you do it as such things are rightly done, and at
the time such things are rightly done, no one will interfere.
I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in London,
and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up
his house, some burglar come and broke window at back and got in.
Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out
and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police.
Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise it,
and put up big notice.  And when the day come he sell off by a
great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them.
Then he go to a builder, and he sell him that house, making an agreement
that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time.
And your police and other authority help him all they can.
And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland
he find only an empty hole where his house had been.
This was all done en regle, and in our work we shall be en regle too.
We shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little
to think of, shall deem it strange.  But we shall go after ten
o'clock, when there are many about, and such things would be done
were we indeed owners of the house.""

I could not but see how right he was and the terrible
despair of Mina's face became relaxed in thought.
There was hope in such good counsel.

Van Helsing went on, ""When once within that house we may find more clues.
At any rate some of us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places
where there be more earth boxes, at Bermondsey and Mile End.""

Lord Godalming stood up.  ""I can be of some use here,"" he said.
""I shall wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they
will be most convenient.""

""Look here, old fellow,"" said Morris, ""it is a capital idea to have
all ready in case we want to go horse backing, but don't you think
that one of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway
of Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purpose?
It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east.
And even leave them somewhere near the neighborhood we are going to.""

""Friend Quincey is right!"" said the Professor.
""His head is what you call in plane with the horizon.
It is a difficult thing that we go to do, and we do not want
no peoples to watch us if so it may.""

Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced
to see that the exigency of affairs was helping her to
forget for a time the terrible experience of the night.
She was very, very pale, almost ghastly, and so thin that her lips
were drawn away, showing her teeth in somewhat of prominence.
I did not mention this last, lest it should give her needless pain,
but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had
occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood.
As yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper,
but the time as yet was short, and there was time for fear.

When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and
of the disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt.
It was finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy
the Count's lair close at hand.  In case he should find it out too soon,
we should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction.
And his presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest,
might give us some new clue.

A s to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the
Professor that, after our visit to Carfax, we should all
enter the house in Piccadilly.  That the two doctors and I
should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming and Quincey found
the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.
It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged,
that the Count might appear in Piccadilly during the day,
and that if so we might be able to cope with him then and there.
At any rate, we might be able to follow him in force.
To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as my going
was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect Mina.
I thought that my mind was made up on the subject, but Mina
would not listen to my objection.  She said that there
might be some law matter in which I could be useful.
That amongst the Count's papers might be some clue which I
could understand out of my experience in Transylvania.
And that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was
required to cope with the Count's extraordinary power.
I had to give in, for Mina's resolution was fixed.
She said that it was the last hope for her that we should
all work together.

""As for me,"" she said, ""I have no fear.  Things have been
as bad as they can be.  And whatever may happen must have
in it some element of hope or comfort.  Go, my husband!
God can, if He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with
any one present.""

So I started up crying out, ""Then in God's name let us come at once,
for we are losing time.  The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier
than we think.""

""Not so!"" said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.

""But why?""  I asked.

""Do you forget,"" he said, with actually a smile, ""that last night
he banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?""

Did I forget!  Shall I ever.  . .can I ever!  Can any of us
ever forget that terrible scene!  Mina struggled hard to keep
her brave countenance, but the pain overmastered her and she put
her hands before her face, and shuddered whilst she moaned.
Van Helsing had not intended to recall her frightful experience.
He had simply lost sight of her and her part in the affair
in his intellectual effort.

When it struck him what he said, he was horrified at his thoughtlessness
and tried to comfort her.

""Oh, Madam Mina,"" he said, ""dear, dear, Madam Mina, alas!
That I of all who so reverence you should have said anything
so forgetful.  These stupid old lips of mine and this stupid old
head do not deserve so, but you will forget it, will you not?""
He bent low beside her as he spoke.

She took his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely,
""No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember.
And with it I have so much in memory of you that is sweet,
that I take it all together.  Now, you must all be going soon.
Breakfast is ready, and we must all eat that we may be strong.""

Breakfast was a strange meal to us all.  We tried to be cheerful and
encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of us.
When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said, ""Now, my dear friends,
we go forth to our terrible enterprise.  Are we all armed,
as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy's lair.
Armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?""

We all assured him.

""Then it is well.  Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case quite
safe here until the sunset.  And before then we shall return.
. .if. . .We shall return!  But before we go let me see you armed
against personal attack.  I have myself, since you came down,
prepared your chamber by the placing of things of which we know,
so that He may not enter.  Now let me guard yourself.
On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the name
of the Father, the Son, and.  . .

There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear.
As he had placed the Wafer on Mina's forehead, it had seared it.
. .had burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of whitehot metal.
My poor darling's brain had told her the significance of the fact as
quickly as her nerves received the pain of it, and the two so overwhelmed
her that her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream.

But the words to her thought came quickly.  The echo of the scream
had not ceased to ring on the air when there came the reaction,
and she sank on her knees on the floor in an agony of abasement.
Pulling her beautiful hair over her face, as the leper of old
his mantle, she wailed out.

""Unclean!  Unclean!  Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh!
I must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until
the Judgement Day.""

They all paused.  I had thrown myself beside her in an agony
of helpless grief, and putting my arms around held her tight.
For a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together,
whilst the friends around us turned away their eyes that ran
tears silently.  Then Van Helsing turned and said gravely.
So gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some
way inspired, and was stating things outside himself.

""It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself
see fit, as He most surely shall, on the Judgement Day,
to redress all wrongs of the earth and of His children that He
has placed thereon.  And oh, Madam Mina, my dear, my dear,
may we who love you be there to see, when that red scar,
the sign of God's knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,
and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know.
For so surely as we live, that scar shall pass away when God
sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us.  Till then
we bear our Cross, as His Son did in obedience to His Will.
It may be that we are chosen instruments of His good pleasure,
and that we ascend to His bidding as that other through stripes
and shame.  Through tears and blood.  Through doubts and fear,
and all that makes the difference between God and man.""

There was hope in his words, and comfort.  And they made for resignation.
Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old
man's hands and bent over and kissed it.  Then without a word we all knelt
down together, and all holding hands, swore to be true to each other.
We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of
her whom, each in his own way, we loved.  And we prayed for help and guidance
in the terrible task which lay before us.  It was then time to start.
So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which neither of us shall forget
to our dying day, and we set out.

To one thing I have made up my mind.  If we find out that Mina must be
a vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible
land alone.  I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant many.
Just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so the holiest
love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.

We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things
the same as on the first occasion.  It was hard to believe
that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and
decay there was any ground for such fear as already we knew.
Had not our minds been made up, and had there not been terrible
memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded with our task.
We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house.
And in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had
seen them last.

Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before him, ""And now,
my friends, we have a duty here to do.  We must sterilize this earth,
so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far distant land
for such fell use.  He has chosen this earth because it has been holy.
Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more holy still.
It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to God.""

As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench,
and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open.
The earth smelled musty and close, but we did not somehow seem
to mind, for our attention was concentrated on the Professor.
Taking from his box a piece of the Scared Wafer he laid it
reverently on the earth, and then shutting down the lid began
to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.

One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes,
and left them as we had found them to all appearance.
But in each was a portion of the Host.  When we closed the door
behind us, the Professor said solemnly, ""So much is already done.
It may be that with all the others we can be so successful,
then the sunset of this evening may shine of Madam Mina's
forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!""

As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station
to catch our train we could see the front of the asylum.
I looked eagerly, and in the window of my own room saw Mina.
I waved my hand to her, and nodded to tell that our work there
was successfully accomplished.  She nodded in reply to show that
she understood.  The last I saw, she was waving her hand in farewell.
It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station and just caught
the train, which was steaming in as we reached the platform.
I have written this in the train.


Piccadilly, 12:30 o'clock.--Just before we reached Fenchurch Street
Lord Godalming said to me, ""Quincey and I will find a locksmith.
You had better not come with us in case there should be any difficulty.
For under the circumstances it wouldn't seem so bad for us to break
into an empty house.  But you are a solicitor and the Incorporated Law
Society might tell you that you should have known better.""

I demurred as to my not sharing any danger even of odium, but he went on,
""Besides, it will attract less attention if there are not too many of us.
My title will make it all right with the locksmith, and with any policeman
that may come along.  You had better go with Jack and the Professor
and stay in the Green Park.  Somewhere in sight of the house, and when you
see the door opened and the smith has gone away, do you all come across.
We shall be on the lookout for you, and shall let you in.""

""The advice is good!"" said Van Helsing, so we said no more.
Godalming and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another.
At the corner of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled
into the Green Park.  My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much
of our hope was centered, looming up grim and silent in its deserted
condition amongst its more lively and spruce-looking neighbors.
We sat down on a bench within good view , and began to smoke
cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible.
The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming
of the others.

At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up.  Out of it, in leisurely fashion,
got Lord Godalming and Morris.  And down from the box descended
a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools.
Morris paid the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away.
Together the two ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed
out what he wanted done.  The workman took off his coat leisurely
and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail, saying something
to a policeman who just then sauntered along.  The policeman nodded
acquiescence, and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him.
After searching through it, he took out a selection of tools
which he proceeded to lay beside him in orderly fashion.
Then he stood up, looked in the keyhole, blew into it, and turning
to his employers, made some remark.  Lord Godalming smiled,
and the man lifted a good sized bunch of keys.  Selecting one of them,
he began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it.
After fumbling about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third.
All at once the door opened under a slight push from him,
and he and the two others entered the hall.  We sat still.
My own cigar burnt furiously, but Van Helsing's went cold altogether.
We waited patiently as we saw the workman come out and bring his bag.
Then he held the door partly open, steadying it with his knees,
whilst he fitted a key to the lock.  This he finally handed
to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and gave him something.
The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his coat and departed.
Not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction.

When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked
at the door.  It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom
stood Lord Godalming lighting a cigar.

""The place smells so vilely,"" said the latter as we came in.
It did indeed smell vilely.  Like the old chapel at Carfax.
And with our previous experience it was plain to us
that the Count had been using the place pretty freely.
We moved to explore the house, all keeping together in case
of attack, for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal with,
and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be
in the house.

In the dining room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found eight
boxes of earth.  Eight boxes only out of the nine which we sought!
Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found
the missing box.

First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out across
a narrow stone flagged yard at the blank face of a stable,
pointed to look like the front of a miniature house.  There were
no windows in it, so we were not afraid of being overlooked.
We did not lose any time in examining the chests.  With the tools
which we had brought with us we opened them, one by one,
and treated them as we had treated those others in the old chapel.
It was evident to us that the Count was not at present in the house,
and we proceeded to search for any of his effects.

After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,
we came to the conclusion that the dining room contained any effects which
might belong to the Count.  And so we proceeded to minutely examine them.
They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining room table.

There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle,
deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey,
notepaper, envelopes, and pens and ink.  All were covered up
in thin wrapping paper to keep them from the dust.  There were
also a clothes brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin.
The latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with blood.
Last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes,
probably those belonging to the other houses.

When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming and Quincey
Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the
houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a
great bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places.
The rest of us are, with what patience we can, waiting their return,
or the coming of the Count.





CHAPTER 23


DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


3 October.--The time seemed teribly long whilst we were
waiting for the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris.
The Professor tried to keep our minds active by using
them all the time.  I could see his beneficent purpose,
by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.
The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.
Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong,
youthful face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair.
Today he is a drawn, haggard old man, whose white hair matches well
with the hollow burning eyes and grief-written lines of his face.
His energy is still intact.  In fact, he is like a living flame.
This may yet be his salvation, for if all go well,
it will tide him over the despairing period.  He will then,
in a kind of way, wake again to the realities o f life.
Poor fellow, I thought my own trouble was bad enough,
but his.  . .!

The Professor knows this well enough, and is doing his best to keep
his mind active.  What he has been saying was, under the circumstances,
of absorbing interest.  So well as I can remember, here it is:

""I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands,
all the papers relating to this monster, and the more I have studied,
the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out.
All through there are signs of his advance.  Not only of his power,
but of his knowledge of it.  As I learned from the researches of my
friend Arminius of Buda-Pesth, he was in life a most wonderful man.
Soldier, statesman, and alchemist.  Which latter was the highest
development of the science knowledge of his time.  He had a mighty brain,
a learning beyond compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse.
He dared even to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch
of knowledge of his time that he did not essay.

""Well, in him the brain powers survived the physical death.
Though it would seem that memory was not all complete.
In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child.
But he is growing, and some things that were childish at the first
are now of man's stature.  He is experimenting, and doing it well.
And if it had not been that we have crossed his path he would be yet,
he may be yet if we fail, the father or furtherer of a new order
of beings, whose road must lead through Death, not Life.""

Harker groaned and said, ""And this is all arrayed against my darling!
But how is he experimenting?  The knowledge may help us to defeat him!""

""He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power,
slowly but surely.  That big child-brain of his is working.
Well for us, it is as yet, a child-brain. For had he dared,
at the first, to attempt certain things he would long ago have
been beyond our power.  However, he means to succeed, and a man
who has centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow.
Festina lente may well be his motto.""

""I fail to understand,"" said Harker wearily.  ""Oh, do be more plain to me!
Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.""

The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke,
""Ah, my child, I will be plain.  Do you not see how, of late,
this monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally.
How he has been making use of the zoophagous patient to effect
his entry into friend John's home.  For your Vampire,
though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will,
must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by an inmate.
But these are not his most important experiments.
Do we not see how at the first all these so great boxes
were moved by others.  He knew not then but that must be so.
But all the time that so great child-brain of his was growing,
and he began to consider whether he might not himself move
the box.  So he began to help.  And then, when he found
that this be all right, he try to move them all alone.
And so he progress, and he scatter these graves of him.
And none but he know where they are hidden.

""He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground.
So that only he use them in the night, or at such time
as he can change his form, they do him equal well,
and none may know these are his hiding place!  But, my child,
do not despair, this knowledge came to him just too late!
Already all of his lairs but one be sterilize as for him.
And before the sunset this shall be so.  Then he have no place
where he can move and hide.  I delayed this morning that so we
might be sure.  Is there not more at stake for us than for him?
Then why not be more careful than him?  By my clock it is one
hour and already, if all be well, friend Arthur and Quincey
are on their way to us.  Today is our day, and we must go sure,
if slow, and lose no chance.  See!  There are five of us
when those absent ones return.""

Whilst we were speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door,
the double postman's knock of the telegraph boy.  We all moved
out to the hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his
hand to us to keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it.
The boy handed in a dispatch.  The Professor closed the door again,
and after looking at the direction, opened it and read aloud.

""Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly
and hastened towards the South.  He seems to be going the round
and may want to see you:  Mina.""

There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker's voice, ""Now, God be thanked,
we shall soon meet!""

Van Helsing turned to him quickly and said, ""God will act in His
own way and time.  Do not fear, and do not rejoice as yet.
For what we wish for at the moment may be our own undoings.""

""I care for nothing now,"" he answered hotly, ""except to wipe out this brute
from the face of creation.  I would sell my soul to do it!""

""Oh, hush, hush, my child!"" said Van Helsing.  ""God does not purchase souls
in this wise, and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep faith.
But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your devotion to that
dear Madam Mina.  Think you, how her pain would be doubled, did she but hear
your wild words.  Do not fear any of us, we are all devoted to this cause,
and today shall see the end.  The time is coming for action.  Today this
Vampire is limit to the powers of man, and till sunset he may not change.
It will take him time to arrive here, see it is twenty minutes past one,
and there are yet some times before he can hither come, be he never so quick.
What we must hope for is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.""

About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker's telegram,
there came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door.
It was just an ordinary knock, such as is given hourly by thousands
of gentlemen, but it made the Professor's heart and mine beat loudly.
We looked at each other, and together moved out into the hall.
We each held ready to use our various armaments,
the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right.
Van Helsing pulled back the latch, and holding the door half open,
stood back, having both hands ready for action.  The gladness
of our hearts must have shown upon our faces when on the step,
close to the door, we saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris.
They came quickly in and closed the door behind them,
the former saying, as they moved along the hall.

""It is all right.  We found both places.  Six boxes in each and we
destroyed them all.""

""Destroyed?"" asked the Professor.

""For him!""  We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said,
""There's nothing to do but to wait here.  If, however,
he doesn't turn up by five o'clock, we must start off.
For it won't do to leave Mrs. Harker alone after sunset.""

""He will be here before long now,' said Van Helsing, who had been consulting
his pocketbook.  ""Nota bene, in Madam's telegram he went south from Carfax.
That means he went to cross the river, and he could only do so at slack
of tide, which should be something before one o'clock. That he went
south has a meaning for us.  He is as yet only suspicious, and he went
from Carfax first to the place where he would suspect interference least.
You must have been at Bermondsey only a short time before him.
That he is not here already shows that he went to Mile End next.
This took him some time, for he would then have to be carried over the river
in some way.  Believe me, my friends, we shall not have long to wait now.
We should have ready some plan of attack, so that we may throw away
no chance.  Hush, there is no time now.  Have all your arms!  Be ready!""
He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could hear a key softly
inserted in the lock of the hall door.

I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a dominant
spirit asserted itself.  In all our hunting parties and adventures
in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always been the one
to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been accustomed to obey
him implicitly.  Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively.
With a swift glance around the room, he at once laid out our plan of attack,
and without speaking a word, with a gesture, placed us each in position.
Van Helsing, Harker, and I were just behind the door, so that when it
was opened the Professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between
the incomer and the door.  Godalming behind and Quincey in front
stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window.
We waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness.
The slow, careful steps came along the hall.  The Count was evidently
prepared for some surprise, at least he feared it.

Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room.
Winning a way past us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him.
There was something so pantherlike in the movement, something so unhuman,
that it seemed to sober us all from the shock of his coming.
The first to act was Harker, who with a quick movement, threw himself
before the door leading into the room in the front of the house.
As the Count saw us, a horrible sort of snarl passed over his face,
showing the eyeteeth long and pointed.  But the evil smile as quickly
passed into a cold stare of lion-like disdain.  His expression
again changed as, with a single impulse, we all advanced upon him.
It was a pity that we had not some better organized plan of attack,
for even at the moment I wondered what we were to do.  I did not
myself know whether our lethal weapons would avail us anything.

Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had ready his great Kukri
knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him.  The blow was a powerful one.
Only the diabolical quickness of the Count's leap back saved him.
A second less and the trenchant blade had shorn through his coat, making a
wide gap whence a bundle of bank notes and a stream of gold fell out.
The expression of the Count's face was so hellish, that for a moment I
feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again
for another stroke.  Instinctively I moved forward with a protective impulse,
holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand.  I felt a mighty power fly
along my arm, and it was without surprise that I saw the monster cower back
before a similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us.  It would
be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignity,
of anger and hellish rage, which came over the Count's face.  His waxen hue
became greenish-yellow by the contrast of his burning eyes, and the red
scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound.
The next instant, with a sinuous dive he swept under Harker's arm,
ere his blow could fall, and grasping a handful of the money from the floor,
dashed across the room, threw himself at the window.  Amid the crash
and glitter of the falling glass, he tumbled into the flagged area below.
Through the sound of the shivering glass I could hear the ""ting"" of the gold,
as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging.

We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground.  He, rushing up
the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.
There he turned and spoke to us.

""You think to baffle me, you with your pale faces all in a row,
like sheep in a butcher's. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you!
You think you have left me without a place to rest, but I have more.
My revenge is just begun!  I spread it over centuries, and time
is on my side.  Your girls that you all love are mine already.
And through them you and others shall yet be mine, my creatures,
to do my bidding and to be my jackals when I want to feed.  Bah!""

With a contemptuous sneer, he passed quickly through the door,
and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he fastened it behind him.
A door beyond opened and shut.  The first of us to speak was the Professor.
Realizing the difficulty of following him through the stable, we moved
toward the hall.

""We have learnt something.  . .much! Notwithstanding his
brave words, he fears us.  He fears time, he fears want!
For if not, why he hurry so?  His very tone betray him,
or my ears deceive.  Why take that money?  You follow quick.
You are hunters of the wild beast, and understand it so.
For me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him,
if so that he returns.""

As he spoke he put the money remaining in his pocket,
took the title deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them,
and swept the remaining things into the open fireplace,
where he set fire to them with a match.

Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker
had lowered himself from the window to follow the Count.
He had, however, bolted the stable door, and by the time
they had forced it open there was no sign of him.
Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back of the house.
But the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.

It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off.
We had to recognize that our game was up.  With heavy hearts we agreed
with the Professor when he said, ""Let us go back to Madam Mina.
Poor, poor dear Madam Mina.  All we can do just now is done,
and we can there, at least, protect her.  But we need not despair.
There is but one more earth box, and we must try to find it.
When that is done all may yet be well.""

I could see that he spoke as bravely as he could to comfort Harker.
The poor fellow was quite broken down, now and again he gave a low groan
which he could not suppress.  He was thinking of his wife.

With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found
Mrs. Harker waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness
which did honor to her bravery and unselfishness.
When she saw our faces, her own became as pale as death.
For a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were
in secret prayer.

And then she said cheerfully, ""I can never thank you all enough.
Oh, my poor darling!""

As she spoke, she took her husband's grey head in her hands and kissed it.

""Lay your poor head here and rest it.  All will yet be well, dear!  God will
protect us if He so will it in His good intent.""  The poor fellow groaned.
There was no place for words in his sublime misery.

We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered
us all up somewhat.  It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food
to hungry people, for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast,
or the sense of companionship may have helped us, but anyhow we were all
less miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope.

True to our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed.
And although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed
to threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion
to her was manifested she listened bravely and with calmness.
When we came to the part where Harker had rushed at the Count
so recklessly, she clung to her husband's arm, and held it tight as
though her clinging could protect him from any harm that might come.
She said nothing, however, till the narration was all done,
and matters had been brought up to the present time.

Then without letting go her husband's hand she stood up amongst
us and spoke.  Oh, that I could give any idea of the scene.
Of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty
of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead,
of which she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our teeth,
remembering whence and how it came.  Her loving kindness against our
grim hate.  Her tender faith against all our fears and doubting.
And we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness
and purity and faith, was outcast from God.

""Jonathan,"" she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips
it was so full of love and tenderness, ""Jonathan dear, and you
all my true, true friends, I want you to bear something in mind
through all this dreadful time.  I know that you must fight.
That you must destroy even as you destroyed the false Lucy so that
the true Lucy might live hereafter.  But it is not a work of hate.
That poor soul who has wrought all this misery is the saddest case of all.
Just think what will be his joy when he, too, is destroyed in his
worser part that his better part may have spiritual immortality.
You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may not hold your hands
from his destruction.""

As she spoke I could see her husband's face darken and draw together,
as though the passion in him were shriveling his being to its core.
Instinctively the clasp on his wife's hand grew closer, till his
knuckles looked white.  She did not flinch from the pain which I
knew she must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were
more appealing than ever.

As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing his hand
from hers as he spoke.

""May God give him into my hand just for long enough to
destroy that earthly life of him which we are aiming at.
If beyond it I could send his soul forever and ever to burning
hell I would do it!""

""Oh, hush!  Oh, hush in the name of the good God.
Don't say such things, Jonathan, my husband, or you will
crush me with fear and horror.  Just think, my dear.
. .I have been thinking all this long, long day of it.
. .that. . . perhaps.  . .some day.  . . I, too, may need such pity,
and that some other like you, and with equal cause for anger,
may deny it to me!  Oh, my husband!  My husband, indeed I would
have spared you such a thought had there been another way.
But I pray that God may not have treasured your wild words,
except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and sorely
stricken man.  Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence
of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong,
and on whom so many sorrows have come.""

We men were all in tears now.  There was no resisting them,
and we wept openly.  She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels
had prevailed.  Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her,
and putting his arms round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress.
Van Helsing beckoned to us and we stole out of the room,
leaving the two loving hearts alone with their God.

Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against
any coming of the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she
might rest in peace.  She tried to school herself to the belief,
and manifestly for her husband's sake, tried to seem content.
It was a brave struggle, and was, I think and believe,
not without its reward.  Van Helsing had placed at hand a bell
which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.
When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged
that we should sit up, dividing the night between us,
and watch over the safety of the poor stricken lady.
The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us shall
be off to bed as soon as we can.

Godalming has already turned in, for his is the second watch.
Now that my work is done I, too, shall go to bed.





JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


3-4 October, close to midnight.--I thought yesterday
would never end.  There was over me a yearning for sleep,
in some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find
things changed, and that any change must now be for the better.
Before we parted, we discussed what our next step was to be,
but we could arrive at no result.  All we knew was that one earth
box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was.
If he chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years.
And in the meantime, the thought is too horrible, I dare not think
of it even now.  This I know, that if ever there was a woman
who was all perfection, that one is my poor wronged darling.
I loved her a thousand times more for her sweet pity of last night,
a pity that made my own hate of the monster seem despicable.
Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer
by the loss of such a creature.  This is hope to me.
We are all drifting reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor.
Thank God!  Mina is sleeping, and sleeping without dreams.
I fear what her dreams might be like, with such terrible memories
to ground them in.  She has not been so calm, within my seeing,
since the sunset.  Then, for a while, there came over her face
a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March.
I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset
on her face, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning.
I am not sleepy myself, though I am weary.  . .weary to death.
However, I must try to sleep.  For there is tomorrow to think of,
and there is no rest for me until.  . .


Later--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awakened by Mina,
who was sitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face.
I could see easily, for we did not leave the room in darkness.
She had placed a warning hand over my mouth, and now she
whispered in my ear, ""Hush!  There is someone in the corridor!""
I got up softly, and crossing the room, gently opened the door.

Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake.
He raised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me, ""Hush!
Go back to bed.  It is all right.  One of us will be here all night.
We don't mean to take any chances!""

His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina.
She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor,
pale face as she put her arms round me and said softly, ""Oh, thank
God for good brave men!""  With a sigh she sank back again to sleep.
I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again.


4 October, morning.--Once again during the night I was wakened by Mina.
This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming dawn was
making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was like a speck
rather than a disc of light.

She said to me hurriedly, ""Go, call the Professor.
I want to see him at once.""

""Why?""  I asked.

""I have an idea.  I suppose it must have come in the night,
and matured without my knowing it.  He must hypnotize
me before the dawn, and then I shall be able to speak.
Go quick, dearest, the time is getting close.""

I went to the door.  Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress,
and seeing me, he sprang to his feet.

""Is anything wrong?"" he asked, in alarm.

""No,"" I replied.  ""But Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once.""

""I will go,"" he said, and hurried into the Professor's room.

Two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room
in his dressing gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming
were with Dr. Seward at the door asking questions.
When the Professor saw Mina a smile, a positive smile ousted
the anxiety of his face.

He rubbed his hands as he said, ""Oh, my dear Madam Mina,
this is indeed a change.  See!  Friend Jonathan, we have got
our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us today!""  Then turning
to her, he said cheerfully, ""And what am I to do for you?
For at this hour you do not want me for nothing.""

""I want you to hypnotize me!"" she said.  ""Do it before the dawn, for I feel
that then I can speak, and speak freely.  Be quick, for the time is short!""
Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.

Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her,
from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn.
Mina gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart
beat like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand.
Gradually her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still.  Only by
the gentle heaving of her bosom could one know that she was alive.
The Professor made a few more passes and then stopped, and I could
see that his forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration.
Mina opened her eyes, but she did not seem the same woman.
There was a far-away look in her eyes, and her voice had a sad
dreaminess which was new to me.  Raising his hand to impose silence,
the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.
They came on tiptoe, closing the door behind them, and stood at
the foot of the bed, looking on.  Mina appeared not to see them.
The stillness was broken by Van Helsing's voice speaking in a low
level tone which would not break the current of her thoughts.

""Where are you?""  The answer came in a neutral way.

""I do not know.  Sleep has no place it can call its own.""
For several minutes there was silence.  Mina sat rigid,
and the Professor stood staring at her fixedly.

The rest of us hardly dared to breathe.  The room was growing lighter.
Without taking his eyes from Mina's face, Dr. Van Helsing motioned me
to pull up the blind.  I did so, and the day seemed just upon us.
A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse itself through
the room.  On the instant the Professor spoke again.

""Where are you now?""

The answer came dreamily, but with intention.  It were as though she
were interpreting something.  I have heard her use the same tone
when reading her shorthand notes.

""I do not know.  It is all strange to me!""

""What do you see?""

""I can see nothing.  It is all dark.""

""What do you hear?""  I could detect the strain in the
Professor's patient voice.

""The lapping of water.  It is gurgling by, and little waves leap.
I can hear them on the outside.""

""Then you are on a ship?'""

We all looked at each other, trying to glean something each from the other.
We were afraid to think.

The answer came quick, ""Oh, yes!""

""What else do you hear?""

""The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about.
There is the creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check
of the capstan falls into the ratchet.""

""What are you doing?""

""I am still, oh so still.  It is like death!""
The voice faded away into a deep breath as of one sleeping,
and the open eyes closed again.

By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of day.
Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina's shoulders, and laid her head
down softly on her pillow.  She lay like a sleeping child for a few moments,
and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see us
all around her.

""Have I been talking in my sleep?"" was all she said.
She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling,
though she was eager to know what she had told.  The Professor
repeated the conversation, and she said, ""Then there is not
a moment to lose.  It may not be yet too late!""

Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor's
calm voice called them back.

""Stay, my friends.  That ship, wherever it was, was weighing
anchor at the moment in your so great Port of London.
Which of them is it that you seek?  God be thanked that we have
once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we know not.
We have been blind somewhat.  Blind after the manner of men,
since we can look back we see what we might have seen looking
forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen!
Alas, but that sentence is a puddle, is it not?  We can know
now what was in the Count's mind, when he seize that money,
though Jonathan's so fierce knife put him in the danger
that even he dread.  He meant escape.  Hear me, ESCAPE!
He saw that with but one earth box left, and a pack of men
following like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him.
He have take his last earth box on board a ship, and he leave
the land.  He think to escape, but no!  We follow him.  Tally Ho!
As friend Arthur would say when he put on his red frock!
Our old fox is wily.  Oh!  So wily, and we must follow with wile.
I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a little while.
In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are between us
which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he would.
Unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only
at full or slack tide.  See, and the sun is just rose,
and all day to sunset is us.  Let us take bath, and dress,
and have breakfast which we all need, and which we can eat
comfortably since he be not in the same land with us.""

Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked, ""But why need we seek
him further, when he is gone away from us?""

He took her hand and patted it as he replied, ""Ask me nothing as yet.
When we have breakfast, then I answer all questions.""  He would say no more,
and we separated to dress.

After breakfast Mina repeated her question.  He looked at her
gravely for a minute and then said sorrowfully, ""Because my dear,
dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him even if we
have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!""

She grew paler as she asked faintly, ""Why?""

""Because,"" he answered solemnly, ""he can live for centuries,
and you are but mortal woman.  Time is now to be dreaded,
since once he put that mark upon your throat.""

I was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.





CHAPTER 24


DR.  SEWARD'S PHONOGRAPH DIARY

SPOKEN BY VAN HELSING


This to Jonathan Harker.

You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina.  We shall go to make
our search, if I can call it so, for it is not search but knowing,
and we seek confirmation only.  But do you stay and take care
of her today.  This is your best and most holiest office.
This day nothing can find him here.

Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already,
for I have tell them.  He, our enemy, have gone away.
He have gone back to his Castle in Transylvania.  I know it
so well, as if a great hand of fire wrote it on the wall.
He have prepare for this in some way, and that last earth box
was ready to ship somewheres.  For this he took the money.
For this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun
go down.  It was his last hope, save that he might hide
in the tomb that he think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought
like him, keep open to him.  But there was not of time.
When that fail he make straight for his last resource,
his last earth-work I might say did I wish double entente.
He is clever, oh so clever!  He know that his game here was finish.
And so he decide he go back home.  He find ship going by the route
he came, and he go in it.

We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound.
When we have discover that, we come back and tell you all.
Then we will comfort you and poor Madam Mina with new hope.
For it will be hope when you think it over, that all is not lost.
This very creature that we pursue, he take hundreds of years
to get so far as London.  And yet in one day, when we know
of the disposal of him we drive him out.  He is finite,
though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do.
But we are strong, each in our purpose, and we are all more
strong together.  Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina.
This battle is but begun and in the end we shall win.
So sure as that God sits on high to watch over His children.
Therefore be of much comfort till we return.

VAN HELSING.





JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


4 October.--When I read to Mina, Van Helsing's message
in the phonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably.
Already the certainty that the Count is out of the country
has given her comfort.  And comfort is strength to her.
For my own part, now that his horrible danger is not face
to face with us, it seems almost impossible to believe in it.
Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem
like a long forgotten dream.  Here in the crisp autumn air
in the bright sunlight.

Alas!  How can I disbelieve!  In the midst of my thought my eye
fell on the red scar on my poor darling's white forehead.
Whilst that lasts, there can be no disbelief.  Mina and I fear
to be idle, so we have been over all the diaries again and again.
Somehow, although the reality seem greater each time,
the pain and the fear seem less.  There is something of a
guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting.
Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good.
It may be!  I shall try to think as she does.
We have never spoken to each other yet of the future.
It is better to wait till we see the Professor and the others
after their investigations.

The day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could run
for me again.  It is now three o'clock.





MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


5 October, 5 P.M.--Our meeting for report.  Present:  Professor Van Helsing,
Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan Harker, Mina Harker.

Dr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to discover
on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape.

""As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure
that he must go by the Danube mouth, or by somewhere in the Black Sea,
since by that way he come.  It was a dreary blank that was before us.
Omme Ignotum pro magnifico.  And so with heavy hearts we
start to find what ships leave for the Black Sea last night.
He was in sailing ship, since Madam Mina tell of sails being set.
These not so important as to go in your list of the shipping in
the Times, and so we go, by suggestion of Lord Godalming, to your
Lloyd's, where are note of all ships that sail, however so small.
There we find that only one Black Sea bound ship go out with the tide.
She is the Czarina Catherine, and she sail from Doolittle's
Wharf for Varna, and thence to other ports and up the Danube.
`So!' said I, `this is the ship whereon is the Count.'  So off we go
to Doolittle's Wharf, and there we find a man in an office.  From him
we inquire o f the goings of the Czarina Catherine.  He swear much,
and he red face and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same.
And when Quincey give him something from his pocket which crackle
as he roll it up, and put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep
in his clothing, he still better fellow and humble servant to us.
He come with us, and ask many men who are rough and hot.
These be better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty.
They say much of blood and bloom, and of others which I comprehend not,
though I guess what they mean.  But nevertheless they tell us all
things which we want to know.

""They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about
five o'clock comes a man so hurry.  A tall man, thin and pale,
with high nose and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning.
That he be all in black, except that he have a hat of straw
which suit not him or the time.  That he scatter his money
in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the Black
Sea and for where.  Some took him to the office and then
to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore
end of gangplank, and ask that the captain come to him.
The captain come, when told that he will be pay well, and though
he swear much at the first he agree to term.  Then the thin man
go and some one tell him where horse and cart can be hired.
He go there and soon he come again, himself driving cart
on which a great box.  This he himself lift down, though it
take several to put it on truck for the ship.  He give much
talk to captain as to how and where his box is to be place.
But the captain like it not and swear at him in many tongues,
and tell him that if he like he can come and see where it shall be.
But he say `no,' that he come not yet, for that he have much to do.
Whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quick,
with blood, for that his ship will leave the place,
of blood, before the turn of the tide, with blood.
Then the thin man smile and say that of course he must go when
he think fit, but he will be surprise if he go quite so soon.
The captain swear again, polyglot, and the thin man make
him bow, and thank him, and say that he will so far intrude
on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing.
Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues,
tell him that he doesn't want no Frenchmen, with bloom upon
them and also with blood, in his ship, with blood on her also.
And so, after asking where he might purchase ship forms, he departed.

""No one knew where he went `or bloomin' well cared'
as they said, for they had something else to think of,
well with blood again.  For it soon became apparent to all
that the Czarina Catherine would not sail as was expected.
A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew, and grew.
Till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.
The captain swore polyglot, very polyglot, polyglot with bloom
and blood, but he could do nothing.  The water rose and rose,
and he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether.
He was in no friendly mood, when just at full tide, the thin
man came up the gangplank again and asked to see where his box
had been stowed.  Then the captain replied that he wished that
he and his box, old and with much bloom and blood, were in hell.
But the thin man did not be offend, and went down with
the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood
awhile on deck in fog.  He must have come off by himself,
for none notice him.  Indeed they thought not of him,
for soon the fog begin to melt away, and all was clear again.
My friends of the thirst and the language that was of bloom
and blood laughed, as they told how the captain's swears
exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full
of picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on
movement up and down the river that hour, he found that few
of them had seen any of fog at all, except where it lay round
the wharf.  However, the ship went out on the ebb tide,
and was doubtless by morning far down the river mouth.
She was then, when they told us, well out to sea.

""And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time,
for our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way
to the Danube mouth.  To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick.
And when we start to go on land more quick, and we meet him there.
Our best hope is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset.
For then he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should.
There are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan.
We know all about where he go.  For we have seen the owner of
the ship, who have shown us invoices and all papers that can be.
The box we seek is to be landed in Varna, and to be given to an agent,
one Ristics who will there present his credentials.  And so our merchant
friend will have done his part.  When he ask if there be any wrong,
for that so, he can telegraph and have inquiry made at Varna, we say
`no,' for what is to be done is not for police or of the customs.
It must be done by us alone and in our own way.""

When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were
certain that the Count had remained on board the ship.
He replied, ""We have the best proof of that, your own evidence,
when in the hypnotic trance this morning.""

I asked him again if it were really necessary that they
should pursue the Count, for oh!  I dread Jonathan leaving me,
and I know that he would surely go if the others went.
He answered in growing passion, at first quietly.
As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more forceful,
till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least
some of that personal dominance which made him so long
a master amongst men.

""Yes, it is necessary, necessary, necessary!  For your sake
in the first, and then for the sake of humanity.  This monster has
done much harm already, in the narrow scope where he find himself,
and in the short time when as yet he was only as a body groping
his so small measure in darkness and not knowing.  All this
have I told these others.  You, my dear Madam Mina, will learn it
in the phonograph of my friend John, or in that of your husband.
I have told them how the measure of leaving his own barren land,
barren of peoples, and coming to a new land where life of man
teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn,
was the work of centuries.  Were another of the Undead, like him,
to try to do what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries
of the world that have been, or that will be, could aid him.
With this one, all the forces of nature that are occult and deep
and strong must have worked together in some wonderous way.
The very place, where he have been alive, Undead for all these centuries,
is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world.
There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.
There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out
waters of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify.
Doubtless, there is something magnetic or electric in some of these
combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in
strange way, and in himself were from the first some great qualities.
In a hard and warlike time he was celebrate that he have more
iron nerve, more subtle brain, more braver heart, than any man.
In him some vital principle have in strange way found their utmost.
And as his body keep strong and grow and thrive, so his brain grow too.
All this without that diabolic aid which is surely to him.
For it have to yield to the powers that come from, and are,
symbolic of good.  And now this is what he is to us.
He have infect you, oh forgive me, my dear, that I must say such,
but it is for good of you that I speak.  He infect you in such wise,
that even if he do no more, you have only to live, to live in your
own old, sweet way, and so in time, death, which is of man's
common lot and with God's sanction, shall make you like to him.
This must not be!  We have sworn together that it must not.
Thus are we ministers of God's own wish.  That the world,
and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters,
whose very existence would defame Him.  He have allowed us to redeem
one soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross
to redeem more.  Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise.
And like them, if we fall, we fall in good cause.""

He paused and I said, ""But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely?
Since he has been driven from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger
does the village from which he has been hunted?""

""Aha!"" he said, ""your simile of the tiger good, for me,
and I shall adopt him.  Your maneater, as they of India call
the tiger who has once tasted blood of the human, care no more
for the other prey, but prowl unceasing till he get him.
This that we hunt from our village is a tiger, too, a maneater,
and he never cease to prowl.  Nay, in himself he is not one
to retire and stay afar.  In his life, his living life, he go
over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground.
He be beaten back, but did he stay?  No!  He come again,
and again, and again.  Look at his persistence and endurance.
With the child-brain that was to him he have long since conceive
the idea of coming to a great city.  What does he do?
He find out the place of all the world most of promise for him.
Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task.
He find in patience just how is his strength, and what are
his powers.  He study new tongues.  He learn new social life,
new environment of old ways, the politics, the law, the finance,
the science, the habit of a new land and a new people who
have come to be since he was.  His glimpse that he have had,
whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire.  Nay, it help
him to grow as to his brain.  For it all prove to him
how right he was at the first in his surmises.  He have done
this alone, all alone!  From a ruin tomb in a forgotten land.
What more may he not do when the greater world of thought
is open to him.  He that can smile at death, as we know him.
Who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off
whole peoples.  Oh!  If such an one was to come from God,
and not the Devil, what a force for good might he not be in this
old world of ours.  But we are pledged to set the world free.
Our toil must be in silence, and our efforts all in secret.
For in this enlightened age, when men believe not even what they see,
the doubting of wise men would be his greatest strength.
It would be at once his sheath and his armor, and his weapons
to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own
souls for the safety of one we love.  For the good of mankind,
and for the honor and glory of God.""

After a general discussion it was determined that for tonight nothing
be definitely settled.  That we should all sleep on the facts,
and try to think out the proper conclusions.  Tomorrow, at breakfast,
we are to meet again, and after making our conclusions known to one another,
we shall decide on some definite cause of action.  . .

I feel a wonderful peace and rest tonight.  It is as if some haunting
presence were removed from me.  Perhaps.  . .

My surmise was not finished, could not be, for I caught sight in the mirror
of the red mark upon my forehead, and I knew that I was still unclean.





DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


5 October.--We all arose early, and I think that sleep did
much for each and all of us.  When we met at early breakfast
there was more general cheerfulness than any of us had ever
expected to experience again.

It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature.
Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way,
even by death, and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment.
More than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in
wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream.
It was only when I caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker's
forehead that I was brought back to reality.  Even now,
when I am gravely revolving the matter, it is almost impossible
to realize that the cause of all our trouble is still existent.
Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells.
It is only now and again, when something recalls it to her mind,
that she thinks of her terrible scar.  We are to meet here in
my study in half an hour and decide on our course of action.
I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct rather
than reason.  We shall all have to speak frankly.  And yet I fear
that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker's tongue is tied.
I know that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that
has been I can guess how brilliant and how true they must be.
But she will not, or cannot, give them utterance.  I have mentioned this
to Van Helsing, and he and I are to talk it over when we are alone.
I suppose it is some of that horrid poison which has got into her
veins beginning to work.  The Count had his own purposes when he gave
her what Van Helsing called ""the Vampire's baptism of blood.""
Well, there may be a poison that distills itself out of good things.
In an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should
not wonder at anything!  One thing I know, that if my instinct
be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker's silences, then there is
a terrible difficulty, an unknown danger, in the work before us.
The same power that compels her silence may compel her speech.
I dare not think further, for so I should in my thoughts dishonor
a noble woman!


Later.--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of things.
I could see that he had something on his mind, which he wanted to say,
but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject.  After beating
about the bush a little, he said, ""Friend John, there is something
that you and I must talk of alone, just at the first at any rate.
Later, we may have to take the others into our confidence.""

Then he stopped, so I waited.  He went on, ""Madam Mina, our poor,
dear Madam Mina is changing.""

A cold shiver ran through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed.
Van Helsing continued.

""With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be
warned before things go too far.  Our task is now in reality
more difficult than ever, and this new trouble makes every hour
of the direst importance.  I can see the characteristics of
the vampire coming in her face.  It is now but very, very slight.
But it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice without prejudge.
Her teeth are sharper, and at times her eyes are more hard.
But these are not all, there is to her the silence now often,
as so it was with Miss Lucy.  She did not speak, even when she wrote
that which she wished to be known later.  Now my fear is this.
If it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see
and hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotize her first,
and who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his,
should if he will, compel her mind to disclose to him that
which she know?""

I nodded acquiescence.  He went on, ""Then, what we must do is
to prevent this.  We must keep her ignorant of our intent,
and so she cannot tell what she know not.  This is a painful task!
Oh, so painful that it heartbreak me to think of it, but it must be.
When today we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will
not to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply
guarded by us.""

He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse
perspiration at the thought of the pain which he might
have to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured.
I knew that it would be some sort of comfort to him if I
told him that I also had come to the same conclusion.
For at any rate it would take away the pain of doubt.
I told him, and the effect was as I expected.

It is now close to the time of our general gathering.  Van Helsing has
gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it.
I really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.


Later.--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal
relief was experienced by both Van Helsing and myself.
Mrs. Harker had sent a message by her husband to say that she
would not join us at present, as she thought it better
that we should be free to discuss our movements without her
presence to embarrass us.  The Professor and I looked at each
other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved.
For my own part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realized the
danger herself, it was much pain as well as much danger averted.
Under the circumstances we agreed, by a questioning look and answer,
with finger on lip, to preserve silence in our suspicions,
until we should have been able to confer alone again.
We went at once into our Plan of Campaign.

Van Helsing roughly put the facts before us first,
""The Czarina Catherine left the Thames yesterday morning.
It will take her at the quickest speed she has ever made at
least three weeks to reach Varna.  But we can travel overland
to the same place in three days.  Now, if we allow for two days
less for the ship's voyage, owing to such weather influences
as we know that the Count can bring to bear, and if we allow
a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,
then we have a margin of nearly two weeks.

""Thus, in order to be quite safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest.
Then we shall at any rate be in Varna a day before the ship arrives,
and able to make such preparations as may be necessary.
Of course we shall all go armed, armed against evil things,
spiritual as well as physical.""

Here Quincey Morris added, ""I understand that the Count comes from
a wolf country, and it may be that he shall get there before us.
I propose that we add Winchesters to our armament.  I have a kind of
belief in a Winchester when there is any trouble of that sort around.
Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack after us at Tobolsk?
What wouldn't we have given then for a repeater apiece!""

""Good!"" said Van Helsing, ""Winchesters it shall be.
Quincey's head is level at times, but most so when there
is to hunt, metaphor be more dishonor to science than wolves
be of danger to man.  In the meantime we can do nothing here.
And as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of us,
why not go there more soon?  It is as long to wait here as there.
Tonight and tomorrow we can get ready, and then if all be well,
we four can set out on our journey.""

""We four?"" said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of us.

""Of course!"" answered the Professor quickly.  ""You must remain to take
care of your so sweet wife!""

Harker was silent for awhile and then said in a hollow voice,
""Let us talk of that part of it in the morning.
I want to consult with Mina.""

I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him
not to disclose our plan to her, but he took no notice.
I looked at him significantly and coughed.  For answer he put
his finger to his lips and turned away.





JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


October, afternoon.--For some time after our meeting this morning
I could not think.  The new phases of things leave my mind
in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought.
Mina's determination not to take any part in the discussion set
me thinking.  And as I could not argue the matter with her,
I could only guess.  I am as far as ever from a solution now.
The way the others received it, too puzzled me.
The last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there
was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us.
Mina is sleeping now, calmly and sweetly like a little child.
Her lips are curved and her face beams with happiness.
Thank God, there are such moments still for her.


Later.--How strange it all is.  I sat watching Mina's happy sleep,
and I came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be.
As the evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun
sinking lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me.

All at once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly said,
""Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honor.
A promise made to me, but made holily in God's hearing, and not to be broken
though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter tears.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.""

""Mina,"" I said, ""a promise like that, I cannot make at once.
I may have no right to make it.""

""But, dear one,"" she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes
were like pole stars, ""it is I who wish it.  And it is not for myself.
You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right.  If he disagrees you
may do as you will.  Nay, more if you all agree, later you are absolved
from the promise.""

""I promise!""I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy.
Though to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar
on her forehead.

She said, ""Promise me that you will not tell me anything
of the plans formed for the campaign against the Count.
Not by word, or inference, or implication, not at any time whilst
this remains to me!""  And she solemnly pointed to the scar.
I saw that she was in earnest, and said solemnly, ""I promise!""
and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had been
shut between us.


Later, midnight.--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.
So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected
somewhat with her gaiety.  As a result even I myself felt as if the pall
of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted.  We all retired early.
Mina is now sleeping like a little child.  It is wonderful thing that her
faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible trouble.
Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.
Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did tonight.
I shall try it.  Oh!  For a dreamless sleep.

6 October, morning.--Another surprise.  Mina woke me early,
about the same time as yesterday, and asked me to bring
Dr. Van Helsing.  I thought that it was another occassion
for hypnotism, and without question went for the Professor.
He had evidently expected some such call, for I found him
dressed in his room.  His door was ajar, so that he could
hear the opening of the door of our room.  He came at once.
As he passed into the room, he asked Mina if the others
might come, too.

""No,"" she said quite simply, ""it will not be necessary.
You can tell them just as well.  I must go with you
on your journey.""

Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was.  After a moment's pause
he asked, ""But why?""

""You must take me with you.  I am safer with you, and you shall
be safer, too.""

""But why, dear Madam Mina?  You know that your safety is our solemnest duty.
We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than any
of us from.  . .from circumstances.  . .things that have been.""
He paused embarrassed.

As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead.  ""I know.
That is why I must go.  I can tell you now, whilst the sun is coming up.
I may not be able again.  I know that when the Count wills me I must go.
I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must by wile.
By any device to hoodwink, even Jonathan.""  God saw the look that she
turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel that
look is noted to her ever-lasting honor.  I could only clasp her hand.
I could not speak.  My emotion was too great for even the relief of tears.

She went on.  ""You men are brave and strong.  You are strong
in your numbers, for you can defy that which would break
down the human endurance of one who had to guard alone.
Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotize me
and so learn that which even I myself do not know.""

Dr. Van Helsing said gravely, ""Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise.
You shall with us come.  And together we shall do that which we go
forth to achieve.""

When he had spoken, Mina's long spell of silence made me look at her.
She had fallen back on her pillow asleep.  She did not even wake
when I had pulled up the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded
the room.  Van Helsing motioned to me to come with him quietly.
We went to his room, and within a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward,
and Mr. Morris were with us also.

He told them what Mina had said, and went on.
""In the morning we shall leave for Varna.  We have now to deal
with a new factor, Madam Mina.  Oh, but her soul is true.
It is to her an agony to tell us so much as she has done.
But it is most right, and we are warned in time.
There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be ready
to act the instant when that ship arrives.""

""What shall we do exactly?"" asked Mr. Morris laconically.

The Professor paused before replying, ""We shall at the first board
that ship.  Then, when we have identified the box, we shall place
a branch of the wild rose on it.  This we shall fasten, for when it
is there none can emerge, so that at least says the superstition.
And to superstition must we trust at the first.  It was man's faith
in the early, and it have its root in faith still.  Then, when we
get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see,
we shall open the box, and.  . .and all will be well.""

""I shall not wait for any opportunity,"" said Morris.  ""When I see the box
I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand
men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!""
I grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.
I think he understood my look.  I hope he did.

""Good boy,"" said Dr. Van Helsing.  ""Brave boy.  Quincey is all man.
God bless him for it.  My child, believe me none of us shall lag
behind or pause from any fear.  I do but say what we may do.
. .what we must do.  But, indeed, indeed we cannot say
what we may do.  There are so many things which may happen,
and their ways and their ends are so various that until
the moment we may not say.  We shall all be armed, in all ways.
And when the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack.
Now let us today put all our affairs in order.  Let all things
which touch on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete.
For none of us can tell what, or when, or how, the end may be.
As for me, my own affairs are regulate, and as I have nothing
else to do, I shall go make arrangements for the travel.
I shall have all tickets and so forth for our journey.""

There was nothing further to be said, and we parted.
I shall now settle up all my affairs of earth, and be ready
for whatever may come.


Later.--It is done.  My will is made, and all complete.
Mina if she survive is my sole heir.  If it should not be so,
then the others who have been so good to us shall have remainder.

It is now drawing towards the sunset.  Mina's uneasiness
calls my attention to it.  I am sure that there is something
on her mind which the time of exact sunset will reveal.
These occasions are becoming harrowing times for us all.
For each sunrise and sunset opens up some new danger, some new pain,
which however, may in God's will be means to a good end.
I write all these things in the diary since my darling must not
hear them now.  But if it may be that she can see them again,
they shall be ready.  She is calling to me.





CHAPTER 25


DR SEWARD'S DIARY


11 October, Evening.--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this,
as he says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants
an exact record kept.

I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked
to see Mrs. Harker a little before the time of sunset.
We have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset
are to her times of peculiar freedom.  When her old self can be
manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her,
or inciting her to action.  This mood or condition begins
some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset,
and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds
are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon.
At first there is a sort of negative condition, as if some tie
were loosened, and then the absolute freedom quickly follows.
When, however, the freedom ceases the change back or relapse
comes quickly, preceeded only by a spell of warning silence.

Tonight, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore
all the signs of an internal struggle.  I put it down myself
to her making a violent effort at the earliest instant she
could do so.

A very few minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself.
Then, motioning her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she
was half reclining, she made the rest of us bring chairs up close.

Taking her husband's hand in hers, she began, ""We are all
here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time!
I know that you will always be with me to the end.""
This was to her husband whose hand had, as we could see,
tightened upon her.  ""In the morning we go out upon our task,
and God alone knows what may be in store for any of us.
You are going to be so good to me to take me with you.
I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor
weak woman, whose soul perhaps is lost, no, no, not yet,
but is at any rate at stake, you will do.  But you must remember
that I am not as you are.  There is a poison in my blood,
in my soul, which may destroy me, which must destroy me,
unless some relief comes to us.  Oh, my friends, you know as well
as I do, that my soul is at stake.  And though I know there
is one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!""
She looked appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending
with her husband.

""What is that way?"" asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice.
""What is that way, which we must not, may not, take?""

""That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another,
before the greater evil is entirely wrought.  I know, and you know,
that were I once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit,
even as you did my poor Lucy's. Were death, or the fear of death,
the only thing that stood in the way I would not shrink to die
here now, amidst the friends who love me.  But death is not all.
I cannot believe that to die in such a case, when there is
hope before us and a bitter task to be done, is God's will.
Therefore, I on my part, give up here the certainty of eternal rest,
and go out into the dark where may be the blackest things that
the world or the nether world holds!""

We were all silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude.
The faces of the others were set, and Harker's grew ashen grey.
Perhaps, he guessed better than any of us what was coming.

She continued, ""This is what I can give into the hotch-pot.""
I could not but note the quaint legal phrase which she used in such
a place, and with all seriousness.  ""What will each of you give?
Your lives I know,"" she went on quickly, ""that is easy
for brave men.  Your lives are God's, and you can give them
back to Him, but what will you give to me?""  She looked
again questionly, but this time avoided her husband's face.
Quincey seemed to understand, he nodded, and her face lit up.
""Then I shall tell you plainly what I want, for there must
be no doubtful matter in this connection between us now.
You must promise me, one and all, even you, my beloved husband,
that should the time come, you will kill me.""

""What is that time?""  The voice was Quincey's, but it was low and strained.

""When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that I
die that I may live.  When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,
without a moment's delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head,
or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!""

Quincey was the first to rise after the pause.  He knelt
down before her and taking her hand in his said solemnly,
""I'm only a rough fellow, who hasn't, perhaps, lived as a man
should to win such a distinction, but I swear to you by all
that I hold sacred and dear that, should the time ever come,
I shall not flinch from the duty that you have set us.
And I promise you, too, that I shall make all certain, for if I
am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has come!""

""My true friend!"" was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears,
as bending over, she kissed his hand.

""I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!""said Van Helsing.  ""And I!""
said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to take the oath.
I followed, myself.

Then her husband turned to her wan-eyed and with a greenish
pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of his hair, and asked,
""And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?""

""You too, my dearest,"" she said, with infinite yearning
of pity in her voice and eyes.  ""You must not shrink.
You are nearest and dearest and all the world to me.
Our souls are knit into one, for all life and all time.
Think, dear, that there have been times when brave
men have killed their wives and their womenkind,
to keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy.
Their hands did not falter any the more because those that
they loved implored them to slay them.  It is men's duty
towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial!
And oh, my dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at
any hand, let it be at the hand of him that loves me best.
Dr. Van Helsing, I have not forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy's
case to him who loved.""  She stopped with a flying blush,
and changed her phrase, ""to him who had best right to give her peace.
If that time shall come again, I look to you to make it
a happy memory of my husband's life that it was his loving
hand which set me free from the awful thrall upon me.""

""Again I swear!"" came the Professor's resonant voice.

Mrs. Harker smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh
of relief she leaned back and said, ""And now one word
of warning, a warning which you must never forget.
This time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly,
and in such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity.
At such a time I myself might be.  . .nay! If the time ever come,
shall be, leagued with your enemy against you.

""One more request,"" she became very solemn as she said this,
""it is not vital and necessary like the other, but I want you
to do one thing for me, if you will.""

We all acquiesced, but no one spoke.  There was no need to speak.

""I want you to read the Burial Service.""  She was interrupted by a
deep groan from her husband.  Taking his hand in hers, she held it
over her heart, and continued.  ""You must read it over me some day.
Whatever may be the issue of all this fearful state of things,
it will be a sweet thought to all or some of us.  You, my dearest,
will I hope read it, for then it will be in your voice in my
memory forever, come what may!""

""But oh, my dear one,"" he pleaded, ""death is afar off from you.""

""Nay,"" she said, holding up a warning hand.  ""I am deeper in death at this
moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!""

""Oh, my wife, must I read it?"" he said, before he began.

""It would comfort me, my husband!"" was all she said, and he began
to read when she had got the book ready.

How can I, how could anyone, tell of that strange scene, its solemnity,
its gloom, its sadness, its horror, and withal, its sweetness.
Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter
truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted
to the heart had he seen that little group of loving and devoted
friends kneeling round that stricken and sorrowing lady.
Or heard the tender passion of her husband's voice, as in tones
so broken and emotional that often he had to pause, he read the simple
and beautiful service from the Burial of the Dead.  I cannot go on.
. . words.  . .and v-voices. . .f-fail m-me!

She was right in her instinct.  Strange as it was, bizarre as it may
hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time,
it comforted us much.  And the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker's
coming relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair
to any of us as we had dreaded.





JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


15 October, Varna.--We left Charing Cross on the morning
of the 12th, got to Paris the same night, and took the places
secured for us in the Orient Express.  We traveled night
and day, arriving here at about five o'clock. Lord Godalming
went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had arrived
for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel,
""the Odessus.""  The journey may have had incidents.
I was, however, too eager to get on, to care for them.
Until the Czarina Catherine comes into port there will
be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.
Thank God!  Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger.
Her color is coming back.  She sleeps a great deal.
Throughout the journey she slept nearly all the time.
Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very wakeful and alert.
And it has become a habit for Van Helsing to hypnotize
her at such times.  At first, some effort was needed,
and he had to make many passes.  But now, she seems to yield
at once, as if by habit, and scarcely any action is needed.
He seems to have power at these particular moments to simply will,
and her thoughts obey him.  He always asks her what she can
see and hear.

She answers to the first, ""Nothing, all is dark.""

And to the second, ""I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the
water rushing by.  Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak.
The wind is high.  . .I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws
back the foam.""

It is evident that the Czarina Catherine is still at sea,
hastening on her way to Varna.  Lord Godalming has just returned.
He had four telegrams, one each day since we started,
and all to the same effect.  That the Czarina Catherine
had not been reported to Lloyd's from anywhere.
He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should send
him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported.
He was to have a message even if she were not reported,
so that he might be sure that there was a watch being kept
at the other end of the wire.

We had dinner and went to bed early.  Tomorrow we are to see
the Vice Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board
the ship as soon as she arrives.  Van Helsing says that our
chance will be to get on the boat between sunrise and sunset.
The Count, even if he takes the form of a bat, cannot cross
the running water of his own volition, and so cannot leave the ship.
As he dare not change to man's form without suspicion,
which he evidently wishes to avoid, he must remain in the box.
If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at
our mercy, for we can open the box and make sure of him,
as we did of poor Lucy, before he wakes.  What mercy he shall
get from us all will not count for much.  We think that we
shall not have much trouble with officials or the seamen.
Thank God!  This is the country where bribery can do anything,
and we are well supplied with money.  We have only to make
sure that the ship cannot come into port between sunset
and sunrise without our being warned, and we shall be safe.
Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I think!


16 October.--Mina's report still the same.  Lapping waves and rushing
water, darkness and favoring winds.  We are evidently in good time,
and when we hear of the Czarina Catherine we shall be ready.
As she must pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.


17 October.--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think,
to welcome the Count on his return from his tour.
Godalming told the shippers that he fancied that the box sent
aboard might contain something stolen from a friend of his,
and got a half consent that he might open it at his own risk.
The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him
every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship,
and also a similar authorization to his agent at Varna.
We have seen the agent, who was much impressed with Godalming's
kindly manner to him, and we are all satisfied that whatever
he can do to aid our wishes will be done.

We have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open.
If the Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off
his head at once and drive a stake through his heart.
Morris and Godalming and I shall prevent interference,
even if we have to use the arms which we shall have ready.
The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count's body,
it will soon after fall into dust.  In such case there would be no
evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused.
But even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act,
and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence
to come between some of us and a rope.  For myself, I should
take the chance only too thankfully if it were to come.
We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our intent.
We have arranged with certain officials that the instant
the Czarina Catherine is seen, we are to be informed by
a special messenger.


24 October.--A whole week of waiting.  Daily telegrams
to Godalming, but only the same story.  ""Not yet reported.""
Mina's morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried.
Lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking masts.




TELEGRAM, OCTOBER 24TH RUFUS SMITH, LLOYD'S, LONDON, TO LORD GODALMING, CARE OF

H. B. M. VICE CONSUL, VARNA

""Czarina Catherine reported this morning from Dardanelles.""

DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


25 October.--How I miss my phonograph!  To write a diary with a pen
is irksome to me!  But Van Helsing says I must.  We were all wild
with excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd's.
I know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard.
Mrs. Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion.
After all, it is not strange that she did not, for we took special care
not to let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show
any excitement when we were in her presence.  In old days she would,
I am sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it.
But in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks.
The lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well,
and is getting back some of her color, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied.
We talk of her often.  We have not, however, said a word to the others.
It would break poor Harker's heart, certainly his nerve, if he knew that we
had even a suspicion on the subject.  Van Helsing examines, he tells me,
her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition,
for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is
no active danger of a change in her.  If this change should come,
it would be necessary to take steps!  We both know what those steps
would have to be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other.
We should neither of us shrink from the task, awful though it be
to contemplate.  ""Euthanasia"" is an excellent and a comforting word!
I am grateful to whoever invented it.

It is only about 24 hours' sail from the Dardanelles to here,
at the rate the Czarina Catherine has come from London.
She should therefore arrive some time in the morning, but as she
cannot possibly get in before noon, we are all about to retire early.
We shall get up at one o'clock, so as to be ready.


25 October, Noon.--No news yet of the ship's arrival.
Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual,
so it is possible that we may get news at any moment.
We men are all in a fever of excitement, except Harker, who is calm.
His hands are cold as ice, and an hour ago I found him whetting the edge
of the great Ghoorka knife which he now always carries with him.
It will be a bad lookout for the Count if the edge of that ""Kukri""
ever touches his throat, driven by that stern, ice-cold hand!

Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker today.
About noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like.
Although we kept silence to the others, we were neither of us
happy about it.  She had been restless all the morning, so that we
were at first glad to know that she was sleeping.  When, however,
her husband mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly
that he could not wake her, we went to her room to see for ourselves.
She was breathing naturally and looked so well and peaceful that we
agreed that the sleep was better for her than anything else.
Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder that sleep,
if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.


Later.--Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep
of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she
had been for days.  At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report.
Wherever he may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to
his destination.  To his doom, I trust!



26 October.--Another day and no tidings of the Czarina Catherine.
She ought to be here by now.  That she is still journeying somewhere
is apparent, for Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report at sunrise was still the same.
It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog.
Some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog
both to north and south of the port.  We must continue our watching,
as the ship may now be signalled any moment.


27 October, Noon.--Most strange.  No news yet of the ship we wait for.
Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual.  ""Lapping waves
and rushing water,"" though she added that ""the waves were very faint.""
The telegrams from London have been the same, ""no further report.""
Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he fears
the Count is escaping us.

He added significantly, ""I did not like that lethargy of Madam
Mina's. Souls and memories can do strange things during trance.""
I was about to as k him more, but Harker just then came in,
and he held up a warning hand.  We must try tonight at sunset
to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.

28 October.--Telegram.  Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming,
care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna

""Czarina Catherine reported entering Galatz at one o'clock today.""




DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


28 October.--When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I
do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been expected.
True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would come.
But I think we all expected that something strange would happen.
The day of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things
would not be just as we had expected.  We only waited to learn where
the change would occur.  None the less, however, it was a surprise.
I suppose that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe
against ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we
should know that they will be.  Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels,
even if it be a will-o'-the-wisp to man.  Van Helsing raised his hand
over his head for a moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty.
But he said not a word, and in a few seconds stood up with his
face sternly set.

Lord Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily.
I was myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one after another.
Quincey Morris tightened his belt with that quick movement which I
knew so well.  In our old wandering days it meant ""action.""
Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so that the scar on her forehead seemed
to burn, but she folded her hands meekly and looked up in prayer.
Harker smiled, actually smiled, the dark, bitter smile of one who is
without hope, but at the same time his action belied his words,
for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of the great Kukri
knife and rested there.

""When does the next train start for Galatz?"" said Van Helsing
to us generally.

""At 6:30 tomorrow morning!""  We all started, for the answer came
from Mrs. Harker.

""How on earth do you know?"" said Art.

""You forget, or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does
and so does Dr. Van Helsing, that I am the train fiend.
At home in Exeter I always used to make up the time tables,
so as to be helpful to my husband.  I found it so useful sometimes,
that I always make a study of the time tables now.
I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle Dracula
we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest,
so I learned the times very carefully.  Unhappily there are not
many to learn, as the only train tomorrow leaves as I say.""

""Wonderful woman!"" murmured the Professor.

""Can't we get a special?"" asked Lord Godalming.

Van Helsing shook his head, ""I fear not.  This land is very
different from yours or mine.  Even if we did have a special,
it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular train.
Moreover, we have something to prepare.  We must think.
Now let us organize.  You, friend Arthur, go to the train
and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go
in the morning.  Do you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent
of the ship and get from him letters to the agent in Galatz,
with authority to make a search of the ship just as it was here.
Quincey Morris, you see the Vice Consul, and get his aid
with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our
way smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube.
John will stay with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult.
For so if time be long you may be delayed.  And it will not matter
when the sun set, since I am here with Madam to make report.""

""And I,"" said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self
than she had been for many a long day, ""shall try to be of use
in all ways, and shall think and write for you as I used to do.
Something is shifting from me in some strange way, and I feel freer
than I have been of late!""

The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed
to realize the significance of her words.  But Van Helsing and I,
turning to each other, met each a grave and troubled glance.
We said nothing at the time, however.

When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing
asked Mrs. Harker to look up the copy of the diaries
and find him the part of Harker's journal at the Castle.
She went away to get it.

When the door was shut upon her he said to me, ""We mean the same!
Speak out!""

""Here is some change.  It is a hope that makes me sick,
for it may deceive us.""

""Quite so.  Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?""

""No!"" said I, ""unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.""

""You are in part right, friend John, but only in part.
I want to tell you something.  And oh, my friend, I am taking
a great, a terrible, risk.  But I believe it is right.
In the moment when Madam Mina said those words that arrest both
our understanding, an inspiration came to me.  In the trance
of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her mind.
Or more like he took her to see him in his earth box in the ship
with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun.
He learn then that we are here, for she have more to tell in her
open life with eyes to see ears to hear than he, shut as he is,
in his coffin box.  Now he make his most effort to escape us.
At present he want her not.

""He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call.
But he cut her off, take her, as he can do, out of his own power,
that so she come not to him.  Ah!  There I have hope that our man brains
that have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God,
will come higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,
that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and
therefore small.  Here comes Madam Mina.  Not a word to her of her trance!
She knows it not, and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when we
want all her hope, all her courage, when most we want all her great brain
which is trained like man's brain, but is of sweet woman and have a special
power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away altogether,
though he think not so.  Hush!  Let me speak, and you shall learn.  Oh, John,
my friend, we are in awful straits.  I fear, as I never feared before.
We can only trust the good God.  Silence!  Here she comes!""

I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,
just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled
himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped
into the room, bright and happy looking and, in the doing of work,
seemingly forgetful of her misery.  As she came in, she handed a number
of sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing.  He looked over them gravely,
his face brightening up as he read.

Then holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said,
""Friend John, to you with so much experience already,
and you too, dear Madam Mina, that are young, here is a lesson.
Do not fear ever to think.  A half thought has been buzzing
often in my brain, but I fear to let him loose his wings.
Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to where that half
thought come from and I find that he be no half thought at all.
That be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet
strong to use his little wings.  Nay, like the `Ugly Duck'
of my friend Hans Andersen, he be no duck thought at all,
but a big swan thought that sail nobly on big wings,
when the time come for him to try them.  See I read here
what Jonathan have written.

""That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again,
brought his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land,
who when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again,
though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his
troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone
could ultimately triumph.

""What does this tell us?  Not much?  No!  The Count's
child thought see nothing, therefore he speak so free.
Your man thought see nothing.  My man thought see nothing,
till just now.  No!  But there comes another word from some one
who speak without thought because she, too, know not what it mean,
what it might mean.  Just as there are elements which rest,
yet when in nature's course they move on their way and they touch,
the pouf!  And there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind
and kill and destroy some.  But that show up all earth below
for leagues and leagues.  Is it not so?  Well, I shall explain.
To begin, hav e you ever study the philosophy of crime?
`Yes' and `No.' You, John, yes, for it is a study of insanity.
You, no, Madam Mina, for crime touch you not, not but once.
Still, your mind works true, and argues not a particulari
ad universale.  There is this peculiarity in criminals.
It is so constant, in all countries and at all times,
that even police, who know not much from philosophy, come to
know it empirically, that it is.  That is to be empiric.
The criminal always work at one crime, that is the true criminal
who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.
This criminal has not full man brain.  He is clever and cunning
and resourceful, but he be not of man stature as to brain.
He be of child brain in much.  Now this criminal of ours
is predestinate to crime also.  He, too, have child brain,
and it is of the child to do what he have done.  The little bird,
the little fish, the little animal learn not by principle,
but empirically.  And when he learn to do, then there is
to him the ground to start from to do more.  `Dos pou sto,'
said Archimedes.  `Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!'
To do once, is the fulcrum whereby child brain become man brain.
And until he have the purpose to do more, he continue to do
the same again every time, just as he have done before!
Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are opened, and that to you
the lightning flash show all the leagues, ""for Mrs. Harker
began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled.

He went on, ""Now you shall speak.  Tell us two dry men of science what you see
with those so bright eyes.""  He took her hand and held it whilst he spoke.
His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively
and unconsciously, as she spoke.

""The Count is a criminal and of criminal type.  Nordau and Lombroso would
so classify him, and qua criminal he is of an imperfectly formed mind.
Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit.  His past is
a clue, and the one page of it that we know, and that from his own lips,
tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a`tight place,'
he went back to his own country from the land he had tried to invade,
and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself for a new effort.
He came again better equipped for his work, and won.  So he came to London
to invade a new land.  He was beaten, and when all hope of success was lost,
and his existence in danger, he fled back over the sea to his home.
Just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube from Turkey Land.""

""Good, good!  Oh, you so clever lady!"" said Van Helsing,
enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand.
A moment later he said to me, as calmly as though we had
been having a sick room consultation, ""Seventy-two only,
and in all this excitement.  I have hope.""

Turning to her again, he said with keen expectation, ""But go on.
Go on!  There is more to tell if you will.  Be not afraid.
John and I know.  I do in any case, and shall tell you if you
are right.  Speak, without fear!""

""I will try to.  But you will forgive me if I seem too egotistical.""

""Nay!  Fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.""

""Then, as he is criminal he is selfish.  And as his intellect
is small and his action is based on selfishness, he confines
himself to one purpose.  That purpose is remorseless.
As he fled back over the Danube, leaving his forces to be cut
to pieces, so now he is intent on being safe, careless of all.
So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat from the terrible
power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night.
I felt it!  Oh, I felt it!  Thank God, for His great mercy!
My soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour.
And all that haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream
he may have used my knowledge for his ends.""

The Professor stood up, ""He has so used your mind,
and by it he has left us here in Varna, whilst the ship
that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to Galatz,
where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.
But his child mind only saw so far.  And it may be that as ever
is in God's Providence, the very thing that the evil doer most
reckoned on for his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm.
The hunter is taken in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says.
For now that he think he is free from every trace of us all,
and that he has escaped us with so many hours to him,
then his selfish child brain will whisper him to sleep.
He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind,
there can be no knowledge of him to you.  There is where he fail!
That terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free
to go to him in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times
of freedom, when the sun rise and set.  At such times you go
by my volition and not by his.  And this power to good of you
and others, you have won from your suffering at his hands.
This is now all more precious that he know it not, and to guard
himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our where.
We, however, are not selfish, and we believe that God is with
us through all this blackness, and these many dark hours.
We shall follow him, and we shall not flinch.  Even if we peril
ourselves that we become like him.  Friend John, this has been
a great hour, and it have done much to advance us on our way.
You must be scribe and write him all down, so that when
the others return from their work you can give it to them,
then they shall know as we do.""

And so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker
has written with the typewriter all since she brought the MS to us.





CHAPTER 26


DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


29 October.--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz.
Last night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could, so far as thought,
and endeavor, and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole
of our journey, and for our work when we get to Galatz.
When the usual time came round Mrs. Harker prepared herself
for her hypnotic effort, and after a longer and more serious
effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually necessary,
she sank into the trance.  Usually she speaks on a hint,
but this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to
ask them pretty resolutely, before we could learn anything.
At last her answer came.

""I can see nothing.  We are still.  There are no waves lapping,
but only a steady swirl of water softly running against
the hawser.  I can hear men's voices calling, near and far,
and the roll and creak of oars in the rowlocks.
A gun is fired somewhere, the echo of it seems far away.
There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are
dragged along.  What is this?  There is a gleam of light.
I can feel the air blowing upon me.""

Here she stopped.  She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay
on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting
a weight.  Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.
Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently,
whilst Harker's hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri.
There was a long pause.  We all knew that the time when she could speak
was passing, but we felt that it was useless to say anything.

Suddenly she sat up, and as she opened her eyes said sweetly,
""Would none of you like a cup of tea?  You must all be so tired!""

We could only make her happy, and so acqueisced.  She bustled off to get tea.
When she had gone Van Helsing said, ""You see, my friends.  He is close
to land.  He has left his earth chest.  But he has yet to get on shore.
In the night he may lie hidden somewhere, but if he be not carried
on shore, or if the ship do not touch it, he cannot achieve the land.
In such case he can, if it be in the night, change his form and jump
or fly on shore, then, unless he be carried he cannot escape.
And if he be carried, then the customs men may discover what the box contain.
Thus, in fine, if he escape not on shore tonight, or before dawn,
there will be the whole day lost to him.  We may then arrive in time.
For if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime, boxed up
and at our mercy.  For he dare not be his true self, awake and visible,
lest he be discovered.""

There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn,
at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.

Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety,
for her response in her trance.  The hypnotic stage was even
longer in coming than before, and when it came the time remaining
until full sunrise was so short that we began to despair.
Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole soul into the effort.
At last, in obedience to his will she made reply.

""All is dark.  I hear lapping water, level with me, and some
creaking as of wood on wood.""  She paused, and the red sun shot up.
We must wait till tonight.

And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony
of expectation.  We are due to arrive between two and three in
the morning.  But already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late,
so we cannot possibly get in till well after sunup.
Thus we shall have two more hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker!
Either or both may possibly throw more light on what is happening.


Later.--Sunset has come and gone.  Fortunately it came at a time
when there was no distraction.  For had it occurred whilst we were at
a station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.
Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily
than this morning.  I am in fear that her power of reading
the Count's sensations may die away, just when we want it most.
It seems to me that her imagination is beginning to work.
Whilst she has been in the trance hitherto she has confined herself
to the simplest of facts.  If this goes on it may ultimately mislead us.
If I thought that the Count's power over her would die away
equally with her power of knowledge it would be a happy thought.
But I am afraid that it may not be so.

When she did speak, her words were enigmatical, ""Something is going out.
I can feel it pass me like a cold wind.  I can hear, far off, confused sounds,
as of men talking in strange tongues, fierce falling water, and the howling
of wolves.""  She stopped and a shudder ran through her, increasing in
intensity for a few seconds, till at the end, she shook as though in a palsy.
She said no more, even in answer to the Professor's imperative questioning.
When she woke from the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid,
but her mind was all alert.  She could not remember anything, but asked
what she had said.  When she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long
time and in silence.


30 October, 7 A.M.--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time
to write later.  Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.
Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,
Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual.  They produced
no effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with
a still greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose.
The Professor lost no time in his questioning.

Her answer came with equal quickness, ""All is dark.  I hear water
swirling by, level with my ears, and the creaking of wood on wood.
Cattle low far off.  There is another sound, a queer one like.
. ."" She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.

""Go on, go on!  Speak, I command you!"" said Van Helsing in an
agonized voice.  At the same time there was despair in his eyes,
for the risen sun was reddening even Mrs. Harker's pale face.
She opened her eyes, and we all started as she said,
sweetly and seemingly with the utmost unconcern.

""Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can't? I don't
remember anything.""  Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces,
she said, turning from one to the other with a troubled look,
""What have I said?  What have I done?  I know nothing, only that I
was lying here, half asleep, and heard you say `go on! speak,
I command you!'  It seemed so funny to hear you order me about,
as if I were a bad child!""

""Oh, Madam Mina,"" he said, sadly, ""it is proof, if proof be needed, of how I
love and honor you, when a word for your good, spoken more earnest than ever,
can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I am proud to obey!""

The whistles are sounding.  We are nearing Galatz.
We are on fire with anxiety and eagerness.

MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


30 October.--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms
had been ordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best
be spared, since he does not speak any foreign language.
The forces were distributed much as they had been at Varna,
except that Lord Godalming went to the Vice Consul, as his rank
might serve as an immediate guarantee of some sort to the official,
we being in extreme hurry.  Jonathan and the two doctors went
to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival
of the Czarina Catherine.


Later.--Lord Godalming has returned.  The Consul is away, and the Vice
Consul sick.  So the routine work has been attended to by a clerk.
He was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.





JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


30 October.--At nine o'clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called
on Messrs.  Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of Hapgood.
They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord Godalming's
telegraphed request, asking them to show us any civility in their power.
They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once on board
the Czarina Catherine, which lay at anchor out in the river harbor.
There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his voyage.
He said that in all his life he had never had so favorable a run.

""Man!"" he said, ""but it made us afeard, for we expect it that we should
have to pay for it wi' some rare piece o' ill luck, so as to keep up
the average.  It's no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi'
a wind ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin' on yer sail
for his ain purpose.  An' a' the time we could no speer a thing.
Gin we were nigh a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us
and travelled wi' us, till when after it had lifted and we looked out,
the deil a thing could we see.  We ran by Gibraltar wi' oot bein'
able to signal.  An' til we came to the Dardanelles and had to wait
to get our permit to pass, we never were within hail o' aught.  At first
I inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the fog was lifted.
But whiles, I thocht that if the Deil was minded to get us into
the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it whether we would or no.
If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi'the owners,
or no hurt to our traffic, an' the Old Mon who had served his ain purpose
wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin' him.""

This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition
and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said,
""Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought
by some, and he know when he meet his match!""

The skipper was not displeased with the compliment, and went on,
""When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble.
Some o' them, the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave
overboard a big box which had been put on board by a
queer lookin' old man just before we had started frae London.
I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa
fingers when they saw him, to guard them against the evil eye.
Man! but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous!
I sent them aboot their business pretty quick, but as just
after a fog closed in on us I felt a wee bit as they did
anent something, though I wouldn't say it was again the big box.
Well, on we went, and as the fog didn't let up for five
days I joost let the wind carry us, for if the Deil wanted
to get somewheres, well, he would fetch it up a'reet. An'
if he didn't, well, we'd keep a sharp lookout anyhow.
Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and deep water all the time.
And two days ago, when the mornin' sun came through the fog,
we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.
The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take
out the box and fling it in the river.  I had to argy wi'
them aboot it wi' a handspike.  An' when the last o' them rose
off the deck wi' his head in his hand, I had convinced them that,
evil eye or no evil eye, the property and the trust of my
owners were better in my hands than in the river Danube.
They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to fling in,
and as it was marked Galatz via Varna, I thocht I'd let it lie
till we discharged in the port an' get rid o't althegither.
We didn't do much clearin' that day, an' had to remain the nicht
at anchor.  But in the mornin', braw an' airly, an hour
before sunup, a man came aboard wi' an order, written to him
from England, to receive a box marked for one Count Dracula.
Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to his hand.
He had his papers a' reet, an' gla d I was to be rid o'
the dam' thing, for I was beginnin' masel' to feel uneasy at it.
If the Deil did have any luggage aboord the ship, I'm thinkin'
it was nane ither than that same!""

""What was the name of the man who took it?"" asked Dr. Van Helsing
with restrained eagerness.

""I'll be tellin' ye quick!"" he answered, and stepping down
to his cabin, produced a receipt signed ""Immanuel Hildesheim.""
Burgen-strasse 16 was the address.  We found out that this
was all the Captain knew, so with thanks we came away.

We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather
the Adelphi Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez.
His arguments were pointed with specie, we doing the punctuation,
and with a little bargaining he told us what he knew.
This turned out to be simple but important.  He had received
a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling him to receive,
if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box
which would arrive at Galatz in the Czarina Catherine.
This he was to give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky,
who dealt with the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port.
He had been paid for his work by an English bank note, which had
been duly cashed for gold at the Danube International Bank.
When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to the ship
and handed over the box, so as to save parterage.
That was all he knew.

We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him.
One of his neighbors, who did not seem to bear him any affection,
said that he had gone away two days before, no one knew whither.
This was corroborated by his landlord, who had received by messenger
the key of the house together with the rent due, in English money.
This had been between ten and eleven o'clock last night.
We were at a standstill again.

Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly
gasped out that the body of Skinsky had been found
inside the wall of the churchyard of St. Peter, and that
the throat had been torn open as if by some wild animal.
Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror,
the women crying out.  ""This is the work of a Slovak!""
We hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn
into the affair, and so detained.

As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion.
We were all convinced that the box was on its way, by water,
to somewhere, but where that might be we would have to discover.
With heavy hearts we came home to the hotel to Mina.

When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking
Mina again into our confidence.  Things are getting desperate,
and it is at least a chance, though a hazardous one.
As a preliminary step, I was released from my promise to her.





MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


30 October, evening.--They were so tired and worn out and dispirited that
there was nothing to be done till they had some rest, so I asked them all to
lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything up to the moment.
I feel so grateful to the man who invented the ""Traveller's"" typewriter,
and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for me.  I should have felt quite
astray doing the work if I had to write with a pen.  . .

It is all done.  Poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered,
what he must be suffering now.  He lies on the sofa hardly seeming
to breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse.  His brows are knit.
His face is drawn with pain.  Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I
can see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts.
Oh! if I could only help at all.  I shall do what I can.

I have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers
that I have not yet seen.  Whilst they are resting, I shall go
over all carefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion.
I shall try to follow the Professor's example, and think without
prejudice on the facts before me.  . .

I do believe that under God's providence I have made a discovery.
I shall get the maps and look over them.

I am more than ever sure that I am right.  My new conclusion is ready,
so I shall get our party together and read it.  They can judge it.
It is well to be accurate, and every minute is precious.





MINA HARKER'S MEMORANDUM

(ENTERED IN HER JOURNAL)


Ground of inquiry.--Count Dracula's problem is to get back
to his own place.

(a) He must be brought back by some one.  This is evident.
For had he power to move himself as he wished he could go
either as man, or wolf, or bat, or in some other way.
He evidently fears discovery or interference, in the state
of helplessness in which he must be, confined as he is between
dawn and sunset in his wooden box.

(b) How is he to be taken?--Here a process of exclusions may help us.
By road, by rail, by water?

1.  By Road.--There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the city.

(x) There are people.  And people are curious, and investigate.
A hint, a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box,
would destroy him.

(y) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.

(z) His pursuers might follow.  This is his highest fear.
And in order to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled,
so far as he can, even his victim, me!

2.  By Rail.--There is no one in charge of the box.
It would have to take its chance of being delayed,
and delay would be fatal, with enemies on the track.
True, he might escape at night.  But what would he be,
if left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to?
This is not what he intends, and he does not mean to risk it.

3.  By Water.--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most
danger in another.  On the water he is powerless except at night.
Even then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves.
But were he wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless,
and he would indeed be lost.  He could have the vessel drive to land,
but if it were unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move,
his position would still be desperate.

We know from the record that he was on the water, so what we
have to do is to ascertain what water.

The first thing is to realize exactly what he has done as yet.
We may, then, get a light on what his task is to be.

Firstly.--We must differentiate between what he did in London
as part of his general plan of action, when he was pressed
for moments and had to arrange as best he could.

Secondly we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we know of,
what he has done here.

As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent
invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of exit
from England.  His immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.
The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent ot Immanuel
Hildesheim to clear and take away the box before sunrise.
There is also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky.  These we must
only guess at, but there must have been some letter or message,
since Skinsky came to Hildesheim.

That, so far, his plans were successful we know.
The Czarina Catherine made a phenomenally quick journey.
So much so that Captain Donelson's suspicions were aroused.
But his superstition united with his canniness played
the Count's game for him, and he ran with his favoring wind
through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz.
That the Count's arrangements were well made, has been proved.
Hildesheim cleared the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky.
Skinsky took it, and here we lose the trail.  We only know
that the box is somewhere on the water, moving along.
The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been avoided.

Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival,
on land, at Galatz.

The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise.
At sunrise the Count could appear in his own form.
Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work?
In my husband's diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing
with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port.
And the man's remark, that the murder was the work of
a Slovak, showed the general feeling against his class.
The Count wanted isolation.

My surmise is this, that in London the Count decided to get
back to his castle by water, as the most safe and secret way.
He was brought from the castle by Szgany, and probably they
delivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna,
for there they were shipped to London.  Thus the Count had
knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service.
When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset,
he came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what
to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river.
When this was done, and he knew that all was in train, he blotted
out his traces, as he thought, by murdering his agent.

I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable
for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth.
I read in the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low
and water swirling level with my ears and the creaking of wood.
The Count in his box, then, was on a river in an open boat,
propelled probably either by oars or poles, for the banks
are near and it is working against stream.  There would be no
such if floating down stream.

Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth,
but we may possibly investigate further.  Now of these two,
the Pruth is the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu,
joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo Pass.
The loop it makes is manifestly as close to Dracula's castle
as can be got by water.


MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL--CONTINUED


When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me.
The others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said,
""Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher.  Her eyes have
been where we were blinded.  Now we are on the track once again,
and this time we may succeed.  Our enemy is at his most helpless.
And if we can come on him by day, on the water, our task will be over.
He has a start, but he is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave
this box lest those who carry him may suspect.  For them to suspect
would be to prompt them to throw him in the stream where he perish.
This he knows, and will not.  Now men, to our Council of War,
for here and now, we must plan what each and all shall do.""

""I shall get a steam launch and follow him,"" said Lord Godalming.

""And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,""
said Mr. Morris.

""Good!"" said the Professor, ""both good.  But neither must
go alone.  There must be force to overcome force if need be.
The Slovak is strong and rough, and he carries rude arms.""
All the men smiled, for amongst them they carried a small arsenal.

Said Mr. Morris, ""I have brought some Winchesters.
They are pretty handy in a crowd, and there may be wolves.
The Count, if you remember, took some other precautions.
He made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could not
quite hear or understand.  We must be ready at all points.""

Dr. Seward said, ""I think I had better go with Quincey.
We have been accustomed to hunt together, and we two,
well armed, will be a match for whatever may come along.
You must not be alone, Art.  It may be necessary to fight the Slovaks,
and a chance thrust, for I don't suppose these fellows carry guns,
would undo all our plans.  There must be no chances, this time.
We shall not rest until the Count's head and body have
been separated, and we are sure that he cannot reincarnate.""

He looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan looked at me.
I could see that the poor dear was torn about in his mind.
Of course he wanted to be with me.  But then the boat
service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the.
. .the. . .Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?)

He was silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke,
""Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons.
First, because you are young and brave and can fight, and all energies
may be needed at the last.  And again that it is your right to
destroy him.  That, which has wrought such woe to you and yours.
Be not afraid for Madam Mina.  She will be my care, if I may.
I am old.  My legs are not so quick to run as once.
And I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be,
or to fight with lethal weapons.  But I can be of other service.
I can fight in other way.  And I can die, if need be, as well
as younger men.  Now let me say that what I would is this.
While you, my Lord Godalming and friend Jonathan go in your
so swift little steamboat up the river, and whilst John
and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be landed,
I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy's country.
Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running
stream whence he cannot escape to land, where he dares not raise
the lid of his coffin box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear
leave him to perish, we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,
from Bistritz over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle
of Dracula.  Here, Madam Mina's hypnotic power will surely help,
and we shall find our way, all dark and unknown otherwise,
after the first sunrise when we are near that fateful place.
There is much to be done, and other places to be made sanctify,
so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.""

Here Jonathan interrupted him hotly, ""Do you mean to say,
Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina, in her
sad case and tainted as she is with that devil's illness,
right into the jaws of his deathtrap?  Not for the world!
Not for Heaven or Hell!""

He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on, ""Do you know
what the place is?  Have you seen that awful den of hellish infamy,
with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and ever speck
of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?
Have you felt the Vampire's lips upon your throat?""

Here he turned to me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms
with a cry, ""Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us?""
and he sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery.

The Professor's voice, as he spoke in clear, sweet tones,
which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed us all.

""Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful place
that I would go.  God forbid that I should take her into that place.
There is work, wild work, to be done before that place can be purify.
Remember that we are in terrible straits.  If the Count escape us this time,
and he is strong and subtle and cunning, he may choose to sleep him
for a century, and then in time our dear one,"" he took my hand,
""would come to him to keep him company, and would be as those others
that you, Jonathan, saw.  You have told us of their gloating lips.
You heard their ribald laugh as they clutched the moving bag
that the Count threw to them.  You shudder, and well may it be.
Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is necessary.  My friend,
is it not a dire need for that which I am giving, possibly my life?
If it, were that any one went into that place to stay, it is I who would
have to go to keep them company.""

""Do as you will,"" said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over,
""we are in the hands of God!""


Later.--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked.
How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true,
and so brave!  And, too, it made me think of the wonderful
power of money!  What can it not do when basely used.  I felt
so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and both he and Mr. Morris,
who also has plenty of money, are willing to spend it so freely.
For if they did not, our little expedition could not start,
either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within another hour.
It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each of us
was to do.  And now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely
steam launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment's notice.
Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed.
We have all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had.
Professor Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train tonight
for Veresti, where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass.
We are bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy
a carriage and horses.  We shall drive ourselves, for we have
no one whom we can trust in the matter.  The Professor knows
something of a great many languages, so we shall get on all right.
We have all got arms, even for me a large bore revolver.  Jonathan would
not be happy unless I was armed like the rest.  Alas!  I cannot carry
one arm that the rest do, the scar on my forehead forbids that.
Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me that I am fully armed
as there may be wolves.  The weather is getting colder every hour,
and there are snow flurries which come and go as warnings.


Later.--It took all my courage to say goodby to my darling.
We may never meet again.  Courage, Mina!  The Professor
is looking at you keenly.  His look is a warning.
There must be no tears now, unless it may be that God will let
them fall in gladness.





JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


30 October, night.--I am writing this in the light from the furnace
door of the steam launch.  Lord Godalming is firing up.
He is an experienced hand at the work, as he has had for years
a launch of his own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads.
Regarding our plans, we finally decided that Mina's guess
was correct, and that if any waterway was chosen for the Count's
escape back to his Castle, the Sereth and then the Bistritza
at its junction, would be the one.  We took it, that somewhere
about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the place chosen
for crossing the country between the river and the Carpathians.
We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at night.
There is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough
apart to make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough.
Lord Godalming tells me to sleep for a while, as it is enough
for the present for one to be on watch.  But I cannot sleep,
how can I with the terrible danger hanging over my darling,
and her going out into that awful place.  . .

My only comfort is that we are in the hands of God.  Only for that faith it
would be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble.
Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started.
They are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher
lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following
of its curves.  They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and
lead their spare horses, four in all, so as not to excite curiosity.
When they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves
look after the horses.  It may be necessary for us to join forces.
If so they can mount our whole party.  One of the saddles has a moveable horn,
and can be easily adapted for Mina, if required.

It is a wild adventure we are on.  Here, as we are rushing along through
the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike us,
with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes home.
We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways.
Into a whole world of dark and dreadful things.  Godalming is shutting
the furnace door.  . .


31 October.--Still hurrying along.  The day has come, and Godalming
is sleeping.  I am on watch.  The morning is bitterly cold,
the furnace heat is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats.
As yet we have passed only a few open boats, but none of them had on
board any box or package of anything like the size of the one we seek.
The men were scared every time we turned our electric lamp on them,
and fell on their knees and prayed.


1 November, evening.--No news all day.  We have found nothing
of the kind we seek.  We have now passed into the Bistritza,
and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance is gone.
We have overhauled every boat, big and little.  Early this morning,
one crew took us for a Government boat, and treated
us accordingly.  We saw in this a way of smoothing matters,
so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth,
we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously.
With every boat which we have overhauled since then this trick
has succeeded.  We have had every deference shown to us,
and not once any objection to whatever we chose to ask or do.
Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them,
going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board.
This was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell
us whether the boat turned into the Bistritza or continued
on up the Sereth.  At Fundu we could not hear of any
such boat, so she must have passed there in the night.
I am feeling very sleepy.  The cold is perhaps beginning
to tell upon me, and nature must have rest some time.
Godalming insists that he shall keep the first watch.
God bless him for all his goodness to poor dear Mina and me.


2 November, morning.--It is broad daylight.  That good fellow
would not wake me.  He says it would have been a sin to,
for I slept peacefully and was forgetting my trouble.
It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept so long,
and let him watch all night, but he was quite right.
I am a new man this morning.  And, as I sit here and
watch him sleeping, I can do all that is necessary both
as to minding the engine, steering, and keeping watch.
I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to me.
I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing.
They should have got to Veresti about noon on Wednesday.
It would take them some time to get the carriage and horses.
So if they had started and travelled hard, they would
be about now at the Borgo Pass.  God guide and help them!
I am afraid to think what may happen.  If we could only go faster.
But we cannot.  The engines are throbbing and doing their utmost.
I wonder how Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on.
There seem to be endless streams running down the mountains
into this river, but as none of them are very large, at present,
at all events, though they are doubtless terrible in winter and when
the snow melts, the horsemen may not have met much obstruction.
I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see them.
For if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may
be necessary to take counsel together what to do next.





DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


2 November.--Three days on the road.  No news, and no time
to write it if there had been, for every moment is precious.
We have had only the rest needful for the horses.
But we are both bearing it wonderfully.  Those adventurous
days of ours are turning up useful.  We must push on.
We shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.


3 Novenber.--We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the Bistritza.
I wish it wasn't so cold.  There are signs of snow coming.
And if it falls heavy it will stop us.  In such case we must get
a sledge and go on, Russian fashion.

4 Novenber.--Today we heard of the launch having been detained
by an accident when trying to force a way up the rapids.
The Slovak boats get up all right, by aid of a rope and steering
with knowledge.  Some went up only a few hours before.
Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and evidently it was
he who put the launch in trim again.

Finally, they got up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on
the chase afresh.  I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident,
the peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again,
she kept stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight.
We must push on harder than ever.  Our help may be wanted soon.





MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


31 October.--Arrived at Veresti at noon.  The Professor tells me that this
morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotize me at all, and that all I could
say was, ""dark and quiet.""  He is off now buying a carriage and horses.
He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, so that we
may be able to change them on the way.  We have something more than 70
miles before us.  The country is lovely, and most interesting.  If only we
were under different conditions, how delightful it would be to see it all.
If Jonathan and I were driving through it alone what a pleasure it would be.
To stop and see people, and learn something of their life, and to fill our
minds and memories with all the color and picturesqueness of the whole wild,
beautiful country and the quaint people!  But, alas!


Later.--Dr. Van Helsing has returned.  He has got the carriage
and horses.  We are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour.
The landlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions.
It seems enough for a company of soldiers.  The Professor encourages her,
and whispers to me that it may be a week before we can get any food again.
He has been shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful
lot of fur coats and wraps, and all sorts of warm things.
There will not be any chance of our being cold.

We shall soon be off.  I am afraid to think what may happen to us.
We are truly in the hands of God.  He alone knows what may be,
and I pray Him, with all the strength of my sad and humble soul,
that He will watch over my beloved husband.  That whatever may happen,
Jonathan may know that I loved him and honored him more than I can say,
and that my latest and truest thought will be always for him.





CHAPTER 27


MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


1 November.--All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed.
The horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated,
for they go willingly their full stage at best speed.
We have now had so many changes and find the same thing so constantly
that we are encouraged to think that the journey will be an easy one.
Dr. Van Helsing is laconic, he tells the farmers that he is hurrying
to Bistritz, and pays them well to make the exchange of horses.
We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea, and off we go.
It is a lovely country.  Full of beauties of all imaginable kinds,
and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem
full of nice qualities.  They are very, very superstitious.
In the first house where we stopped, when the woman who served
us saw the scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and put
out two fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye.
I believe they went to the trouble of putting an extra
amount of garlic into our food, and I can't abide garlic.
Ever since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil,
and so have escaped their suspicions.  We are travelling fast,
and as we have no driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead
of scandal.  But I daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow
hard behind us all the way.  The Professor seems tireless.
All day he would not take any rest, though he made me sleep
for a long spell.  At sunset time he hypnotized me, and he says I
answered as usual, ""darkness, lapping water and creaking wood.""
So our enemy is still on the river.  I am afraid to think
of Jonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself.
I write this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses
to be ready.  Dr. Van Helsing is sleeping.  Poor dear, he looks
very tired and old and grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a
conqueror's. Even in his sleep he is intense with resolution.
When we have well started I must make him rest whilst I drive.
I shall tell him that we have days before us, and he must
not break down when most of all his strength will be needed.
. .All is ready.  We are off shortly.


2 November, morning.--I was successful, and we took turns
driving all night.  Now the day is on us, bright though cold.
There is a strange heaviness in the air.  I say heaviness
for want of a better word.  I mean that it oppresses us both.
It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep us comfortable.
At dawn Van Helsing hypnotized me.  He says I answered ""darkness, creaking
wood and roaring water,"" so the river is changing as they ascend.
I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of danger,
more than need be, but we are in God's hands.


2 November, night.--All day long driving.  The country gets
wilder as we go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians,
which at Veresti seemed so far from us and so low on
the horizon, now seem to gather round us and tower in front.
We both seem in good spirits.  I think we make an effort
each to cheer the other, in the doing so we cheer ourselves.
Dr. Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass.
The houses are very few here now, and the Professor says
that the last horse we got will have to go on with us, as we
may not be able to change.  He got two in addition to the two
we changed, so that now we have a rude four-in-hand. The dear
horses are patient and good, and they give us no trouble.
We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I
can drive.  We shall get to the Pass in daylight.
We do not want to arrive before.  So we take it easy, and have
each a long rest in turn.  Oh, what will tomorrow bring to us?
We go to seek the place where my poor darling suffered so much.
God grant that we may be guided aright, and that He will
deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both,
and who are in such deadly peril.  As for me, I am not worthy
in His sight.  Alas!  I am unclean to His eyes, and shall
be until He may deign to let me stand forth in His sight
as one of those who have not incurred His wrath.





MEMORANDUM BY ABRAHAM VAN HELSING


4 November.--This to my old and true friend John Seward,
M. D., of Purefleet, London, in case I may not see him.
It may explain.  It is morning, and I write by a fire
which all the night I have kept alive, Madam Mina aiding me.
It is cold, cold.  So cold that the grey heavy sky is full of snow,
which when it falls will settle for all winter as the ground is
hardening to receive it.  It seems to have affected Madam Mina.
She has been so heavy of head all day that she was not
like herself.  She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps!
She who is usual so alert, have done literally nothing all the day.
She even have lost her appetite.  She make no entry into her
little diary, she who write so faithful at every pause.
Something whisper to me that all is not well.  However, tonight she
is more vif.  Her long sleep all day have refresh and
restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever.
At sunset I try to hypnotize her, but alas! with no effect.
The power has grown less and less with each day, and tonight it
fail me altogether.  Well, God's will be done, whatever it may be,
and whithersoever it may lead!

Now to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, I must,
in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go unrecorded.

We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning.
When I saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism.
We stopped our carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance.
I made a couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual,
but more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep.
As before, came the answer, ""darkness and the swirling of water.""
Then she woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach
the Pass.  At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal.
Some new guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road
and say, ""This is the way.""

""How know you it?""  I ask.

""Of course I know it,' she answer, and with a pause, add, ""Have not my
Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?""

At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there
be only one such byroad.  It is used but little, and very
different from the coach road from the Bukovina to Bistritz,
which is more wide and hard, and more of use.

So we came down this road.  When we meet other ways, not always
were we sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect
and light snow have fallen, the horses know and they only.
I give rein to them, and they go on so patient.  By and by we
find all the things which Jonathan have note in that wonderful
diary of him.  Then we go on for long, long hours and hours.
At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep.  She try,
and she succeed.  She sleep all the time, till at the last,
I feel myself to suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her.
But she sleep on, and I may not wake her though I try.
I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm her.  For I know that
she have suffer much, and sleep at times be all-in-all to her.
I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel guilt,
as though I have done something.  I find myself bolt up,
with the reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog,
just as ever.  I look down and find Madam Mina still asleep.
It is now not far off sunset time, and over the snow
the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood, so that we
throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.
For we are going up, and up, and all is oh, so wild and rocky,
as though it were the end of the world.

Then I arouse Madam Mina.  This time she wake with not
much trouble, and then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep.
But she sleep not, being as though I were not.  Still I try
and try, till all at once I find her and myself in dark,
so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.
Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her.  She is now
quite awake, and look so well as I never saw her since that
night at Carfax when we first enter the Count's house.
I am amaze, and not at ease then.  But she is so bright
and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear.
I light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us,
and she prepare food while I undo the horses and set them,
tethered in shelter, to feed.  Then when I return to the fire
she have my supper ready.  I go to help her, but she smile,
and tell me that she have eat already.  That she was so hungry
that she would not wait.  I like it not, and I have grave doubts.
But I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it.
She help me and I eat alone, and then we wrap in fur and lie
beside the fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch.
But presently I forget all of watching.  And when I sudden
remember that I watch, I find her lying quiet, but awake,
and looking at me with so bright eyes.  Once, twice more
the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning.
When I wake I try to hypnotize her, but alas!
Though she shut her eyes obedient, she may not sleep.
The sun rise up, and up, and up, and then sleep come to her too late,
but so heavy that she will not wake.  I have to lift her up,
and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have harnessed
the horses and made all ready.  Madam still sleep, and she
look in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before.
And I like it not.  And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!  I am
afraid of all things, even to think but I must go on my way.
The stake we play for is life and death, or more than these,
and we must not flinch.


5 November, morning.--Let me be accurate in everything,
for though you and I have seen some strange things together,
you may at the first think that I, Van Helsing, am mad.
That the many horrors and the so long strain on nerves has
at the last turn my brain.

All yesterday we travel, always getting closer to the mountains,
and moving into a more and more wild and desert land.
There are great, frowning precipices and much falling water,
and Nature seem to have held sometime her carnival.
Madam Mina still sleep and sleep.  And though I did have hunger
and appeased it, I could not waken her, even for food.
I began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was
upon her, tainted as she is with that Vampire baptism.
""Well,"" said I to myself, ""if it be that she sleep all
the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at night.""
As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient
and imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept.

Again I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed,
and found Madam Mina still sleeping, and the sun low down.
But all was indeed changed.  The frowning mountains seemed further
away, and we were near the top of a steep rising hill, on summit
of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell of in his diary.
At once I exulted and feared.  For now, for good or ill,
the end was near.

I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotize her, but alas!
unavailing till too late.  Then, ere the great dark came upon us,
for even after down sun the heavens reflected the gone sun
on the snow, and all was for a time in a great twilight.
I took out the horses and fed them in what shelter I could.
Then I make a fire, and near it I make Madam Mina, now awake
and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid her rugs.
I got ready food, but she would not eat, simply saying that she
had not hunger.  I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness.
But I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all.
Then, with the fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring
so big for her comfort, round where Madam Mina sat.
And over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and I broke it
fine so that all was well guarded.  She sat still all the time,
so still as one dead.  And she grew whiter and even whiter
till the snow was not more pale, and no word she said.
But when I drew near, she clung to me, and I could know
that the poor soul shook her from head to feet with a tremor
that was pain to feel.

I said to her presently, when she had grown more quiet, ""Will you not
come over to the fire?"" for I wished to make a test of what she could.
She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she stopped, and stood
as one stricken.

""Why not go on?""  I asked.  She shook her head, and coming back,
sat down in her place.  Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked
from sleep, she said simply, ""I cannot!"" and remained silent.  I rejoiced,
for I knew that what she could not, none of those that we dreaded could.
Though there might be danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!

Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I
came to them and quieted them.  When they did feel my hands on them,
they whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet
for a time.  Many times through the night did I come to them,
till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest,
and every time my coming was with quiet of them.  In the cold hour
the fire began to die, and I was about stepping forth to replenish it,
for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist.
Even in the dark there was a light of some kind, as there ever
is over snow, and it seemed as though the snow flurries and the
wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments.
All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered,
as if in terror of the worst.  I began to fear, horrible fears.
But then came to me the sense of safety in that ring wherein I stood.
I began too, to think that my imaginings were of the night, and the gloom,
and the unrest that I have gone through, and all the terrible anxiety.
It was as though my memories of all Jonathan's horrid experience
were befooling me.  For the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel
and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy glimpse
of those women that would have kissed him.  And then the horses
cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain.
Even the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away.
I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near
and circled round.  I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me.
When I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught
me and held me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears
in a dream, so low it was.

""No!  No!  Do not go without.  Here you are safe!""

I turned to her, and looking in her eyes said, ""But you?
It is for you that I fear!""

Whereat she laughed, a laugh low and unreal, and said, ""Fear for me!
Why fear for me?  None safer in all the world from them than I am,""
and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of wind made the flame
leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.  Then, alas!  I knew.
Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the wheeling figures of mist
and snow came closer, but keeping ever without the Holy circle.
Then they began to materialize till, if God have not taken away my reason,
for I saw it through my eyes.  There were before me in actual flesh
the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when they would
have kissed his throat.  I knew the swaying round forms, the bright
hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy color, the voluptuous lips.
They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina.  And as their laugh came
through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed
to her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said
were of the intolerable sweetness of the water glasses, ""Come, sister.
Come to us.  Come!""

In fear I turned to my poor Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness
leapt like flame.  For oh! the terror in her sweet eyes,
the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my heart that was
all of hope.  God be thanked she was not, yet of them.
I seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding
out some of the Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire.
They drew back before me, and laughed their low horrid laugh.  I fed
the fire, and feared them not.  For I knew that we were safe within
the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter.
The horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground.
The snow fell on them softly, and they grew whiter.
I knew that there was for the poor beasts no more of terror.

And so we remained till the red of the dawn began to fall through
the snow gloom.  I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror.
But when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.
At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling mist
and snow.  The wreaths of transparent gloom moved away towards the castle,
and were lost.

Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending to
hypnotize her.  But she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I
could not wake her.  I tried to hypnotize through her sleep, but she
made no response, none at all, and the day broke.  I fear yet to stir.
I have made my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead.
Today I have much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high.
For there may be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow
and mist obscure it, will be to me a safety.

I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will do my terrible work.
Madam Mina still sleeps, and God be thanked!  She is calm in her sleep.  . .





JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


4 November, evening.--The accident to the launch has been
a terrible thing for us.  Only for it we should have overtaken
the boat long ago, and by now my dear Mina would have been free.
I fear to think of her, off on the wolds near that horrid place.
We have got horses, and we follow on the track.  I note
this whilst Godalming is getting ready.  We have our arms.
The Szgany must look out if they mean to fight.  Oh, if only
Morris and Seward were with us.  We must only hope!
If I write no more Goodby Mina!  God bless and keep you.

DR.  SEWARD'S DIARY


5 November.--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before
us dashing away from the river with their leiter wagon.
They surrounded it in a cluster, and hurried along as though beset.
The snow is falling lightly and there is a strange excitement in the air.
It may be our own feelings, but the depression is strange.
Far off I hear the howling of wolves.  The snow brings them down
from the mountains, and there are dangers to all of us, and from
all sides.  The horses are nearly ready, and we are soon off.
We ride to death of some one.  God alone knows who, or where,
or what, or when, or how it may be.  . .





DR.  VAN HELSING'S MEMORANDUM


5 November, afternoon.--I am at least sane.  Thank God for that mercy
at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful.  When I left
Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.
The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was useful,
though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty hinges,
lest some ill intent or ill chance should close them, so that being entered
I might not get out.  Jonathan's bitter experience served me here.
By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I
knew that here my work lay.  The air was oppressive.  It seemed
as if there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy.
Either there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.
Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.
The dilemma had me between his horns.

Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from
the Vampire in that Holy circle.  And yet even there would be the wolf!
I resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must submit,
if it were God's will.  At any rate it was only death and freedom beyond.
So did I choose for her.  Had it but been for myself the choice had been easy,
the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than the grave of the Vampire!
So I make my choice to go on with my work.

I knew that there were at least three graves to find, graves that
are inhabit.  So I search, and search, and I find one of them.
She lay in her Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous
beauty that I shudder as though I have come to do murder.
Ah, I doubt not that in the old time, when such things were,
many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine, found at
the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve.  So he delay,
and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination
of the wanton Undead have hypnotize him.  And he remain
on and on, till sunset come, and the Vampire sleep be over.
Then the beautiful eyes of the fair woman open and look love,
and the voluptuous mouth present to a kiss, and the man is weak.
And there remain one more victim in the Vampire fold.
One more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Undead!. . .

There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere
presence of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted
with age and heavy with the dust of centuries, though there
be that horrid odor such as the lairs of the Count have had.
Yes, I was moved.  I, Van Helsing, with all my purpose and
with my motive for hate.  I was moved to a yearning for delay
which seemed to paralyze my faculties and to clog my very soul.
It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the strange
oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me.
Certain it was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open eyed
sleep of one who yields to a sweet fascination, when there
came through the snow stilled air a long, low wail, so full
of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound of a clarion.
For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.

Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching
away tomb tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one.
I dared not pause to look on her as I had on her sister,
lest once more I should begin to be enthrall.  But I go on
searching until, presently, I find in a high great tomb as if made
to one much beloved that other fair sister which, like Jonathan
I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of the mist.
She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful,
so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me,
which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers,
made my head whirl with new emotion.  But God be thanked,
that soul wail of my dear Madam Mina had not died out of my ears.
And, before the spell could be wrought further upon me,
I had nerved myself to my wild work.  By this tim e I had
searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell.
And as there had been only three of these Undead phantoms
around us in the night, I took it that there were no more of
active Undead existent.  There was one great tomb more lordly
than all the rest.  Huge it was, and nobly proportioned.
On it was but one word.





DRACULA


This then was the Undead home of the King Vampire, to whom so many more
were due.  Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew.
Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my
awful work, I laid in Dracula's tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished
him from it, Undead, for ever.

Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it.
Had it been but one, it had been easy, comparative.  But three!
To begin twice more after I had been through a deed of horror.
For it was terrible with the sweet Miss Lucy, what would it not
be with these strange ones who had survived through centuries,
and who had been strenghtened by the passing of the years.
Who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives.
. .

Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work.  Had I not been
nerved by thoughts of other dead, and of the living over
whom hung such a pall of fear, I could not have gone on.
I tremble and tremble even yet, though till all was over,
God be thanked, my nerve did stand.  Had I not seen the repose
in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just
ere the final dissolution came, as realization that the soul
had been won, I could not have gone further with my butchery.
I could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake
drove home, the plunging of writhing form, and lips of bloody foam.
I should have fled in terror and left my work undone.
But it is over!  And the poor souls, I can pity them now
and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep
of death for a short moment ere fading.  For, friend John,
hardly had my knife severed the head of each, before the whole
body began to melt away and crumble into its native dust,
as though the death that should have come centuries agone had
at last assert himself and say at once and loud, ""I am here!""

Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can
the Count enter there Undead.

When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept,
she woke from her sleep and, seeing me, cried out in pain
that I had endured too much.

""Come!"" she said, ""come away from this awful place!
Let us go to meet my husband who is, I know, coming towards us.""
She was looking thin and pale and weak.  But her eyes were
pure and glowed with fervor.  I was glad to see her paleness
and her illness, for my mind was full of the fresh horror
of that ruddy vampire sleep.

And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet
our friends, and him, whom Madam Mina tell me that she know are coming
to meet us.





MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


6 November.--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I
took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming.
We did not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill,
for w e had to take heavy rugs and wraps with us.  We dared not
face the possibility of being left without warmth in the cold
and the snow.  We had to take some of our provisions too,
for we were in a perfect desolation, and so far as we could see
through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of habitation.
When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy
walking and sat down to rest.  Then we looked back and saw
where the clear line of Dracula's castle cut the sky.
For we were so deep under the hill whereon it was set that the angle
of perspective of the Carpathian mountains was far below it.
We saw it in all its grandeur, perched a thousand feet on
the summit of a sheer precipice, and with seemingly a great gap
between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side.
There was something wild and uncanny about the place.
We could hear the distant howling of wolves.  They were
far off, but the sound, even though coming muffled through
the deadening snowfall, was full of terror.  I knew from
the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about that he was trying
to seek some strategic point, where we would be less exposed
in case of attack.  The rough roadway still led downwards.
We could trace it through the drifted snow.

In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and
joined him.  He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow
in a rock, with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders.
He took me by the hand and drew me in.

""See!"" he said, ""here you will be in shelter.  And if the wolves
do come I can meet them one by one.""

He brought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me,
and got out some provisions and forced them upon me.
But I could not eat, to even try to do so was repulsive to me,
and much as I would have liked to please him, I could not bring
myself to the attempt.  He looked very sad, but did not reproach me.
Taking his field glasses from the case, he stood on the top
of the rock, and began to search the horizon.

Suddenly he called out, ""Look!  Madam Mina, look!  Look!""

I sprang up and stood beside him on the rock.  He handed me
his glasses and pointed.  The snow was now falling more heavily,
and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning
to blow.  However, there were times when there were pauses
between the snow flurries and I could see a long way round.
From the height where we were it was possible to see a great distance.
And far off, beyond the white waste of snow, I could see the river
lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way.
Straight in front of us and not far off, in fact so near that I wondered
we had not noticed before, came a group of mounted men hurrying along.
In the midst of them was a cart, a long leiter wagon which swept
from side to side, like a dog's tail wagging, with each stern
inequality of the road.  Outlined against the snow as they were,
I could see from the men's clothes that they were peasants or gypsies
of some kind.

On the cart was a great square chest.  My heart leaped as I saw it, for I
felt that the end was coming.  The evening was now drawing close, and well
I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned there,
would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude pursuit.  In fear
I turned to the Professor.  To my consternation, however, he was not there.
An instant later, I saw him below me.  Round the rock he had drawn a circle,
such as we had found shelter in last night.

When he had completed it he stood beside me again saying, ""At least
you shall be safe here from him!""  He took the glasses from me,
and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.
""See,"" he said, ""they come quickly.  They are flogging the horses,
and galloping as hard as they can.""

He paused and went on in a hollow voice, ""They are racing for the sunset.
We may be too late.  God's will be done!""  Down came another blinding
rush of driving snow, and the whole landscape was blotted out.
It soon passed, however, and once more his glasses were fixed on the plain.

Then came a sudden cry, ""Look!  Look!  Look!  See, two horsemen
follow fast, coming up from the south.  It must be Quincey and John.
Take the glass.  Look before the snow blots it all out!""
I took it and looked.  The two men might be Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris.
I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.  At the same time
I knew that Jonathan was not far off.  Looking around I saw on the north
side of the coming party two other men, riding at breakneck speed.
One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took, of course,
to be Lord Godalming.  They too, were pursuing the party with the cart.
When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,
and after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible,
he laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder
at the opening of our shelter.

""They are all converging,"" he said.""When the time comes we shall
have gypsies on all sides.""  I got out my revolver ready to hand,
for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came louder
and closer.  When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.
It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes
close to us, and beyond, the sun shining more and more
brightly as it sank down towards the far mountain tops.
Sweeping the glass all around us I could see here and there
dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger numbers.
The wolves were gathering for their prey.

Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited.
The wind came now in fierce bursts, and the snow was
driven with fury as it swept upon us in circling eddies.
At times we could not see an arm's length before us.
But at others, as the hollow sounding wind swept by us, it seemed
to clear the air space around us so that we could see afar off.
We had of late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise
and sunset, that we knew with fair accuracy when it would be.
And we knew that before long the sun would set.
It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less
than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before
the various bodies began to converge close upon us.
The wind came now with fiercer and more bitter sweeps, and more
steadily from the north.  It seemingly had driven the snow
clouds from us, for with only occasional bursts, the snow fell.
We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party,
the pursued and the pursuers.  Strangely enough those pursued did
not seem to realize, or at least to care, that they were pursued.
They seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun
dropped lower and lower on the mountain tops.

Closer and closer they drew.  The Professor and I crouched
down behind our rock, and held our weapons ready.
I could see that he was determined that they should not pass.
One and all were quite unaware of our presence.

All at once two voices shouted out to, ""Halt!""
One was my Jonathan's, raised in a high key of passion.
The other Mr. Morris' strong resolute tone of quiet command.
The gypsies may not have known the language, but there was no
mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were spoken.
Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming
and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris
on the other.  The leader of the gypsies, a splendid looking
fellow who sat his horse like a centaur, waved them back,
and in a fierce voice gave to his companions some word to proceed.
They lashed the horses which sprang forward.  But the four men
raised their Winchester rifles, and in an unmistakable way
commanded them to stop.  At the same moment Dr. Van Helsing
and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.
Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins
and drew up.  The leader turned to them and gave a word at
which every man of the gypsy party drew what weapon he carried,
knife or pistol, and held himself in readiness to attack.
Issue was joined in an instant.

The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out
in front, and pointed first to the sun, now close down on the hill tops,
and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.
For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their
horses and dashed towards the cart.  I should have felt terrible
fear at seeing Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardor
of battle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them.
I felt no fear, but only a wild, surging desire to do something.
Seeing the quick movement of our parties, the leader of the gypsies
gave a command.  His men instantly formed round the cart in a sort
of undisciplined endeavor, each one shouldering and pushing the other
in his eagerness to carry out the order.

In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring
of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart.
It was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before
the sun should set.  Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them.
Neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies
in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even
attract their attention.  Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest
singleness of his purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him.
Instinctively they cowered aside and let him pass.
In an instant he had jumped upon the cart, and with a strength
which seemed incredible, raised the great box, and flung it
over the wheel to the ground.  In the meantime, Mr. Morris had
had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of Szgany.
All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,
with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward,
and had seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them,
and they cut at him.  He had parried with his great bowie knife,
and at first I thought that he too had come through in safety.
But as he sprang beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart,
I could see that with his left hand he was clutching at his side,
and that the blood was spurting through his fingers.  He did not
delay notwithstanding this, for as Jonathan, with desperate energy,
attacked one end of the chest, attempting to prize off the lid with his
great Kukri knife, he attacked the other frantically with his bowie.
Under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield.
The nails drew with a screeching sound, and the top of the box
was thrown back.

By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,
and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given
in and made no further resistance.  The sun was almost down on
the mountain tops, and the shadows of the whole group fell upon
the snow.  I saw the Count lying within the box upon the earth,
some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him.
He was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes
glared with the horrible vindictive look which I knew so well.

As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them
turned to triumph.

But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife.
I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat.  Whilst at the same moment
Mr. Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart.

It was like a miracle, but before our very eyes, and almost in the drawing
of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from our sight.

I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment
of final dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace,
such as I never could have imagined might have rested there.

The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky,
and every stone of its broken battlements was articulated
against the light of the setting sun.

The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary
disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode
away as if for their lives.  Those who were unmounted jumped upon
the leiter wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them.
The wolves, which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in
their wake, leaving us alone.

Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow,
holding his hand pressed to his side.  The blood still
gushed through his fingers.  I flew to him, for the Holy
circle did not now keep me back, so did the two doctors.
Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his head
on his shoulder.  With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort,
my hand in that of his own which was unstained.

He must have seen the anguish of my heart in my face, for he smiled
at me and said, ""I am only too happy to have been of service!  Oh, God!""
he cried suddenly, struggling to a sitting posture and pointing to me.
""It was worth for this to die!  Look!  Look!""

The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red
gleams fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light.
With one impulse the men sank on their knees and a deep
and earnest ""Amen"" broke from all as their eyes followed
the pointing of his finger.

The dying man spoke, ""Now God be thanked that all has not been
in vain!  See!  The snow is not more stainless than her forehead!
The curse has passed away!""

And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died,
a gallant gentleman.",dracula,Bram Stoker
"CHAPTER I--ADAM SALTON ARRIVES



Adam Salton sauntered into the Empire Club, Sydney, and found
awaiting him a letter from his grand-uncle.  He had first heard from
the old gentleman less than a year before, when Richard Salton had
claimed kinship, stating that he had been unable to write earlier,
as he had found it very difficult to trace his grand-nephew's
address.  Adam was delighted and replied cordially; he had often
heard his father speak of the older branch of the family with whom
his people had long lost touch.  Some interesting correspondence had
ensued.  Adam eagerly opened the letter which had only just arrived,
and conveyed a cordial invitation to stop with his grand-uncle at
Lesser Hill, for as long a time as he could spare.

""Indeed,"" Richard Salton went on, ""I am in hopes that you will make
your permanent home here.  You see, my dear boy, you and I are all
that remain of our race, and it is but fitting that you should
succeed me when the time comes.  In this year of grace, 1860, I am
close on eighty years of age, and though we have been a long-lived
race, the span of life cannot be prolonged beyond reasonable bounds.
I am prepared to like you, and to make your home with me as happy as
you could wish.  So do come at once on receipt of this, and find the
welcome I am waiting to give you.  I send, in case such may make
matters easy for you, a banker's draft for 200 pounds.  Come soon,
so that we may both of us enjoy many happy days together.  If you
are able to give me the pleasure of seeing you, send me as soon as
you can a letter telling me when to expect you.  Then when you
arrive at Plymouth or Southampton or whatever port you are bound
for, wait on board, and I will meet you at the earliest hour
possible.""


Old Mr. Salton was delighted when Adam's reply arrived and sent a
groom hot-foot to his crony, Sir Nathaniel de Salis, to inform him
that his grand-nephew was due at Southampton on the twelfth of June.

Mr. Salton gave instructions to have ready a carriage early on the
important day, to start for Stafford, where he would catch the 11.40
a.m. train.  He would stay that night with his grand-nephew, either
on the ship, which would be a new experience for him, or, if his
guest should prefer it, at a hotel.  In either case they would start
in the early morning for home.  He had given instructions to his
bailiff to send the postillion carriage on to Southampton, to be
ready for their journey home, and to arrange for relays of his own
horses to be sent on at once.  He intended that his grand-nephew,
who had been all his life in Australia, should see something of
rural England on the drive.  He had plenty of young horses of his
own breeding and breaking, and could depend on a journey memorable
to the young man.  The luggage would be sent on by rail to Stafford,
where one of his carts would meet it.  Mr. Salton, during the
journey to Southampton, often wondered if his grand-nephew was as
much excited as he was at the idea of meeting so near a relation for
the first time; and it was with an effort that he controlled
himself.  The endless railway lines and switches round the
Southampton Docks fired his anxiety afresh.

As the train drew up on the dockside, he was getting his hand traps
together, when the carriage door was wrenched open and a young man
jumped in.

""How are you, uncle?  I recognised you from the photo you sent me!
I wanted to meet you as soon as I could, but everything is so
strange to me that I didn't quite know what to do.  However, here I
am.  I am glad to see you, sir.  I have been dreaming of this
happiness for thousands of miles; now I find that the reality beats
all the dreaming!""  As he spoke the old man and the young one were
heartily wringing each other's hands.

The meeting so auspiciously begun proceeded well.  Adam, seeing that
the old man was interested in the novelty of the ship, suggested
that he should stay the night on board, and that he would himself be
ready to start at any hour and go anywhere that the other suggested.
This affectionate willingness to fall in with his own plans quite
won the old man's heart.  He warmly accepted the invitation, and at
once they became not only on terms of affectionate relationship, but
almost like old friends.  The heart of the old man, which had been
empty for so long, found a new delight.  The young man found, on
landing in the old country, a welcome and a surrounding in full
harmony with all his dreams throughout his wanderings and solitude,
and the promise of a fresh and adventurous life.  It was not long
before the old man accepted him to full relationship by calling him
by his Christian name.  After a long talk on affairs of interest,
they retired to the cabin, which the elder was to share.  Richard
Salton put his hands affectionately on the boy's shoulders--though
Adam was in his twenty-seventh year, he was a boy, and always would
be, to his grand-uncle.

""I am so glad to find you as you are, my dear boy--just such a young
man as I had always hoped for as a son, in the days when I still had
such hopes.  However, that is all past.  But thank God there is a
new life to begin for both of us.  To you must be the larger part--
but there is still time for some of it to be shared in common.  I
have waited till we should have seen each other to enter upon the
subject; for I thought it better not to tie up your young life to my
old one till we should have sufficient personal knowledge to justify
such a venture.  Now I can, so far as I am concerned, enter into it
freely, since from the moment my eyes rested on you I saw my son--as
he shall be, God willing--if he chooses such a course himself.""

""Indeed I do, sir--with all my heart!""

""Thank you, Adam, for that.""  The old, man's eyes filled and his
voice trembled.  Then, after a long silence between them, he went
on:  ""When I heard you were coming I made my will.  It was well that
your interests should be protected from that moment on.  Here is the
deed--keep it, Adam.  All I have shall belong to you; and if love
and good wishes, or the memory of them, can make life sweeter, yours
shall be a happy one.  Now, my dear boy, let us turn in.  We start
early in the morning and have a long drive before us.  I hope you
don't mind driving?  I was going to have the old travelling carriage
in which my grandfather, your great-grand-uncle, went to Court when
William IV. was king.  It is all right--they built well in those
days--and it has been kept in perfect order.  But I think I have
done better:  I have sent the carriage in which I travel myself.
The horses are of my own breeding, and relays of them shall take us
all the way.  I hope you like horses?  They have long been one of my
greatest interests in life.""

""I love them, sir, and I am happy to say I have many of my own.  My
father gave me a horse farm for myself when I was eighteen.  I
devoted myself to it, and it has gone on.  Before I came away, my
steward gave me a memorandum that we have in my own place more than
a thousand, nearly all good.""

""I am glad, my boy.  Another link between us.""

""Just fancy what a delight it will be, sir, to see so much of
England--and with you!""

""Thank you again, my boy.  I will tell you all about your future
home and its surroundings as we go.  We shall travel in old-
fashioned state, I tell you.  My grandfather always drove four-in-
hand; and so shall we.""

""Oh, thanks, sir, thanks.  May I take the ribbons sometimes?""

""Whenever you choose, Adam.  The team is your own.  Every horse we
use to-day is to be your own.""

""You are too generous, uncle!""

""Not at all.  Only an old man's selfish pleasure.  It is not every
day that an heir to the old home comes back.  And--oh, by the way. .
. No, we had better turn in now--I shall tell you the rest in the
morning.""



CHAPTER II--THE CASWALLS OF CASTRA REGIS



Mr. Salton had all his life been an early riser, and necessarily an
early waker.  But early as he woke on the next morning--and although
there was an excuse for not prolonging sleep in the constant whirr
and rattle of the ""donkey"" engine winches of the great ship--he met
the eyes of Adam fixed on him from his berth.  His grand-nephew had
given him the sofa, occupying the lower berth himself.  The old man,
despite his great strength and normal activity, was somewhat tired
by his long journey of the day before, and the prolonged and
exciting interview which followed it.  So he was glad to lie still
and rest his body, whilst his mind was actively exercised in taking
in all he could of his strange surroundings.  Adam, too, after the
pastoral habit to which he had been bred, woke with the dawn, and
was ready to enter on the experiences of the new day whenever it
might suit his elder companion.  It was little wonder, then, that,
so soon as each realised the other's readiness, they simultaneously
jumped up and began to dress.  The steward had by previous
instructions early breakfast prepared, and it was not long before
they went down the gangway on shore in search of the carriage.

They found Mr. Salton's bailiff looking out for them on the dock,
and he brought them at once to where the carriage was waiting in the
street.  Richard Salton pointed out with pride to his young
companion the suitability of the vehicle for every need of travel.
To it were harnessed four useful horses, with a postillion to each
pair.

""See,"" said the old man proudly, ""how it has all the luxuries of
useful travel--silence and isolation as well as speed.  There is
nothing to obstruct the view of those travelling and no one to
overhear what they may say.  I have used that trap for a quarter of
a century, and I never saw one more suitable for travel.  You shall
test it shortly.  We are going to drive through the heart of
England; and as we go I'll tell you what I was speaking of last
night.  Our route is to be by Salisbury, Bath, Bristol, Cheltenham,
Worcester, Stafford; and so home.""

Adam remained silent a few minutes, during which he seemed all eyes,
for he perpetually ranged the whole circle of the horizon.

""Has our journey to-day, sir,"" he asked, ""any special relation to
what you said last night that you wanted to tell me?""

""Not directly; but indirectly, everything.""

""Won't you tell me now--I see we cannot be overheard--and if
anything strikes you as we go along, just run it in.  I shall
understand.""

So old Salton spoke:

""To begin at the beginning, Adam.  That lecture of yours on 'The
Romans in Britain,' a report of which you posted to me, set me
thinking--in addition to telling me your tastes.  I wrote to you at
once and asked you to come home, for it struck me that if you were
fond of historical research--as seemed a fact--this was exactly the
place for you, in addition to its being the home of your own
forbears.  If you could learn so much of the British Romans so far
away in New South Wales, where there cannot be even a tradition of
them, what might you not make of the same amount of study on the
very spot.  Where we are going is in the real heart of the old
kingdom of Mercia, where there are traces of all the various
nationalities which made up the conglomerate which became Britain.""

""I rather gathered that you had some more definite--more personal
reason for my hurrying.  After all, history can keep--except in the
making!""

""Quite right, my boy.  I had a reason such as you very wisely
guessed.  I was anxious for you to be here when a rather important
phase of our local history occurred.""

""What is that, if I may ask, sir?""

""Certainly.  The principal land-owner of our part of the county is
on his way home, and there will be a great home-coming, which you
may care to see.  The fact is, for more than a century the various
owners in the succession here, with the exception of a short time,
have lived abroad.""

""How is that, sir, if I may ask?""

""The great house and estate in our part of the world is Castra
Regis, the family seat of the Caswall family.  The last owner who
lived here was Edgar Caswall, grandfather of the man who is coming
here--and he was the only one who stayed even a short time.  This
man's grandfather, also named Edgar--they keep the tradition of the
family Christian name--quarrelled with his family and went to live
abroad, not keeping up any intercourse, good or bad, with his
relatives, although this particular Edgar, as I told you, did visit
his family estate, yet his son was born and lived and died abroad,
while his grandson, the latest inheritor, was also born and lived
abroad till he was over thirty--his present age.  This was the
second line of absentees.  The great estate of Castra Regis has had
no knowledge of its owner for five generations--covering more than a
hundred and twenty years.  It has been well administered, however,
and no tenant or other connected with it has had anything of which
to complain.  All the same, there has been much natural anxiety to
see the new owner, and we are all excited about the event of his
coming.  Even I am, though I own my own estate, which, though
adjacent, is quite apart from Castra Regis.--Here we are now in new
ground for you.  That is the spire of Salisbury Cathedral, and when
we leave that we shall be getting close to the old Roman county, and
you will naturally want your eyes.  So we shall shortly have to keep
our minds on old Mercia.  However, you need not be disappointed.  My
old friend, Sir Nathaniel de Salis, who, like myself, is a free-
holder near Castra Regis--his estate, Doom Tower, is over the border
of Derbyshire, on the Peak--is coming to stay with me for the
festivities to welcome Edgar Caswall.  He is just the sort of man
you will like.  He is devoted to history, and is President of the
Mercian Archaeological Society.  He knows more of our own part of
the country, with its history and its people, than anyone else.  I
expect he will have arrived before us, and we three can have a long
chat after dinner.  He is also our local geologist and natural
historian.  So you and he will have many interests in common.
Amongst other things he has a special knowledge of the Peak and its
caverns, and knows all the old legends of prehistoric times.""

They spent the night at Cheltenham, and on the following morning
resumed their journey to Stafford.  Adam's eyes were in constant
employment, and it was not till Salton declared that they had now
entered on the last stage of their journey, that he referred to Sir
Nathaniel's coming.

As the dusk was closing down, they drove on to Lesser Hill, Mr.
Salton's house.  It was now too dark to see any details of their
surroundings.  Adam could just see that it was on the top of a hill,
not quite so high as that which was covered by the Castle, on whose
tower flew the flag, and which was all ablaze with moving lights,
manifestly used in the preparations for the festivities on the
morrow.  So Adam deferred his curiosity till daylight.  His grand-
uncle was met at the door by a fine old man, who greeted him warmly.

""I came over early as you wished.  I suppose this is your grand-
nephew--I am glad to meet you, Mr. Adam Salton.  I am Nathaniel de
Salis, and your uncle is one of my oldest friends.""

Adam, from the moment of their eyes meeting, felt as if they were
already friends.  The meeting was a new note of welcome to those
that had already sounded in his ears.

The cordiality with which Sir Nathaniel and Adam met, made the
imparting of information easy.  Sir Nathaniel was a clever man of
the world, who had travelled much, and within a certain area studied
deeply.  He was a brilliant conversationalist, as was to be expected
from a successful diplomatist, even under unstimulating conditions.
But he had been touched and to a certain extent fired by the younger
man's evident admiration and willingness to learn from him.
Accordingly the conversation, which began on the most friendly
basis, soon warmed to an interest above proof, as the old man spoke
of it next day to Richard Salton.  He knew already that his old
friend wanted his grand-nephew to learn all he could of the subject
in hand, and so had during his journey from the Peak put his
thoughts in sequence for narration and explanation.  Accordingly,
Adam had only to listen and he must learn much that he wanted to
know.  When dinner was over and the servants had withdrawn, leaving
the three men at their wine, Sir Nathaniel began.

""I gather from your uncle--by the way, I suppose we had better speak
of you as uncle and nephew, instead of going into exact
relationship?  In fact, your uncle is so old and dear a friend,
that, with your permission, I shall drop formality with you
altogether and speak of you and to you as Adam, as though you were
his son.""

""I should like,"" answered the young man, ""nothing better!""

The answer warmed the hearts of both the old men, but, with the
usual avoidance of Englishmen of emotional subjects personal to
themselves, they instinctively returned to the previous question.
Sir Nathaniel took the lead.

""I understand, Adam, that your uncle has posted you regarding the
relationships of the Caswall family?""

""Partly, sir; but I understood that I was to hear minuter details
from you--if you would be so good.""

""I shall be delighted to tell you anything so far as my knowledge
goes.  Well, the first Caswall in our immediate record is an Edgar,
head of the family and owner of the estate, who came into his
kingdom just about the time that George III. did.  He had one son of
about twenty-four.  There was a violent quarrel between the two.  No
one of this generation has any idea of the cause; but, considering
the family characteristics, we may take it for granted that though
it was deep and violent, it was on the surface trivial.

""The result of the quarrel was that the son left the house without a
reconciliation or without even telling his father where he was
going.  He never came back again.  A few years after, he died,
without having in the meantime exchanged a word or a letter with his
father.  He married abroad and left one son, who seems to have been
brought up in ignorance of all belonging to him.  The gulf between
them appears to have been unbridgable; for in time this son married
and in turn had a son, but neither joy nor sorrow brought the
sundered together.  Under such conditions no RAPPROCHEMENT was to be
looked for, and an utter indifference, founded at best on ignorance,
took the place of family affection--even on community of interests.
It was only due to the watchfulness of the lawyers that the birth of
this new heir was ever made known.  He actually spent a few months
in the ancestral home.

""After this the family interest merely rested on heirship of the
estate.  As no other children have been born to any of the newer
generations in the intervening years, all hopes of heritage are now
centred in the grandson of this man.

""Now, it will be well for you to bear in mind the prevailing
characteristics of this race.  These were well preserved and
unchanging; one and all they are the same:  cold, selfish, dominant,
reckless of consequences in pursuit of their own will.  It was not
that they did not keep faith, though that was a matter which gave
them little concern, but that they took care to think beforehand of
what they should do in order to gain their own ends.  If they should
make a mistake, someone else should bear the burthen of it.  This
was so perpetually recurrent that it seemed to be a part of a fixed
policy.  It was no wonder that, whatever changes took place, they
were always ensured in their own possessions.  They were absolutely
cold and hard by nature.  Not one of them--so far as we have any
knowledge--was ever known to be touched by the softer sentiments, to
swerve from his purpose, or hold his hand in obedience to the
dictates of his heart.  The pictures and effigies of them all show
their adherence to the early Roman type.  Their eyes were full;
their hair, of raven blackness, grew thick and close and curly.
Their figures were massive and typical of strength.

""The thick black hair, growing low down on the neck, told of vast
physical strength and endurance.  But the most remarkable
characteristic is the eyes.  Black, piercing, almost unendurable,
they seem to contain in themselves a remarkable will power which
there is no gainsaying.  It is a power that is partly racial and
partly individual:  a power impregnated with some mysterious
quality, partly hypnotic, partly mesmeric, which seems to take away
from eyes that meet them all power of resistance--nay, all power of
wishing to resist.  With eyes like those, set in that all-commanding
face, one would need to be strong indeed to think of resisting the
inflexible will that lay behind.

""You may think, Adam, that all this is imagination on my part,
especially as I have never seen any of them.  So it is, but
imagination based on deep study.  I have made use of all I know or
can surmise logically regarding this strange race.  With such
strange compelling qualities, is it any wonder that there is abroad
an idea that in the race there is some demoniac possession, which
tends to a more definite belief that certain individuals have in the
past sold themselves to the Devil?

""But I think we had better go to bed now.  We have a lot to get
through to-morrow, and I want you to have your brain clear, and all
your susceptibilities fresh.  Moreover, I want you to come with me
for an early walk, during which we may notice, whilst the matter is
fresh in our minds, the peculiar disposition of this place--not
merely your grand-uncle's estate, but the lie of the country around
it.  There are many things on which we may seek--and perhaps find--
enlightenment.  The more we know at the start, the more things which
may come into our view will develop themselves.""



CHAPTER III--DIANA'S GROVE



Curiosity took Adam Salton out of bed in the early morning, but when
he had dressed and gone downstairs; he found that, early as he was,
Sir Nathaniel was ahead of him.  The old gentleman was quite
prepared for a long walk, and they started at once.

Sir Nathaniel, without speaking, led the way to the east, down the
hill.  When they had descended and risen again, they found
themselves on the eastern brink of a steep hill.  It was of lesser
height than that on which the Castle was situated; but it was so
placed that it commanded the various hills that crowned the ridge.
All along the ridge the rock cropped out, bare and bleak, but broken
in rough natural castellation.  The form of the ridge was a segment
of a circle, with the higher points inland to the west.  In the
centre rose the Castle, on the highest point of all.  Between the
various rocky excrescences were groups of trees of various sizes and
heights, amongst some of which were what, in the early morning
light, looked like ruins.  These--whatever they were--were of
massive grey stone, probably limestone rudely cut--if indeed they
were not shaped naturally.  The fall of the ground was steep all
along the ridge, so steep that here and there both trees and rocks
and buildings seemed to overhang the plain far below, through which
ran many streams.

Sir Nathaniel stopped and looked around, as though to lose nothing
of the effect.  The sun had climbed the eastern sky and was making
all details clear.  He pointed with a sweeping gesture, as though
calling Adam's attention to the extent of the view.  Having done so,
he covered the ground more slowly, as though inviting attention to
detail.  Adam was a willing and attentive pupil, and followed his
motions exactly, missing--or trying to miss--nothing.

""I have brought you here, Adam, because it seems to me that this is
the spot on which to begin our investigations.  You have now in
front of you almost the whole of the ancient kingdom of Mercia.  In
fact, we see the whole of it except that furthest part, which is
covered by the Welsh Marches and those parts which are hidden from
where we stand by the high ground of the immediate west.  We can
see--theoretically--the whole of the eastern bound of the kingdom,
which ran south from the Humber to the Wash.  I want you to bear in
mind the trend of the ground, for some time, sooner or later, we
shall do well to have it in our mind's eye when we are considering
the ancient traditions and superstitions, and are trying to find the
RATIONALE of them.  Each legend, each superstition which we receive,
will help in the understanding and possible elucidation of the
others.  And as all such have a local basis, we can come closer to
the truth--or the probability--by knowing the local conditions as we
go along.  It will help us to bring to our aid such geological truth
as we may have between us.  For instance, the building materials
used in various ages can afford their own lessons to understanding
eyes.  The very heights and shapes and materials of these hills--
nay, even of the wide plain that lies between us and the sea--have
in themselves the materials of enlightening books.""

""For instance, sir?"" said Adam, venturing a question.

""Well, look at those hills which surround the main one where the
site for the Castle was wisely chosen--on the highest ground.  Take
the others.  There is something ostensible in each of them, and in
all probability something unseen and unproved, but to be imagined,
also.""

""For instance?"" continued Adam.

""Let us take them SERIATIM.  That to the east, where the trees are,
lower down--that was once the location of a Roman temple, possibly
founded on a pre-existing Druidical one.  Its name implies the
former, and the grove of ancient oaks suggests the latter.""

""Please explain.""

""The old name translated means 'Diana's Grove.'  Then the next one
higher than it, but just beyond it, is called 'MERCY'--in all
probability a corruption or familiarisation of the word MERCIA, with
a Roman pun included.  We learn from early manuscripts that the
place was called VILULA MISERICORDIAE.  It was originally a nunnery,
founded by Queen Bertha, but done away with by King Penda, the
reactionary to Paganism after St. Augustine.  Then comes your
uncle's place--Lesser Hill.  Though it is so close to the Castle, it
is not connected with it.  It is a freehold, and, so far as we know,
of equal age.  It has always belonged to your family.""

""Then there only remains the Castle!""

""That is all; but its history contains the histories of all the
others--in fact, the whole history of early England.""  Sir
Nathaniel, seeing the expectant look on Adam's face, went on:

""The history of the Castle has no beginning so far as we know.  The
furthest records or surmises or inferences simply accept it as
existing.  Some of these--guesses, let us call them--seem to show
that there was some sort of structure there when the Romans came,
therefore it must have been a place of importance in Druid times--if
indeed that was the beginning.  Naturally the Romans accepted it, as
they did everything of the kind that was, or might be, useful.  The
change is shown or inferred in the name Castra.  It was the highest
protected ground, and so naturally became the most important of
their camps.  A study of the map will show you that it must have
been a most important centre.  It both protected the advances
already made to the north, and helped to dominate the sea coast.  It
sheltered the western marches, beyond which lay savage Wales--and
danger.  It provided a means of getting to the Severn, round which
lay the great Roman roads then coming into existence, and made
possible the great waterway to the heart of England--through the
Severn and its tributaries.  It brought the east and the west
together by the swiftest and easiest ways known to those times.
And, finally, it provided means of descent on London and all the
expanse of country watered by the Thames.

""With such a centre, already known and organised, we can easily see
that each fresh wave of invasion--the Angles, the Saxons, the Danes,
and the Normans--found it a desirable possession and so ensured its
upholding.  In the earlier centuries it was merely a vantage ground.
But when the victorious Romans brought with them the heavy solid
fortifications impregnable to the weapons of the time, its
commanding position alone ensured its adequate building and
equipment.  Then it was that the fortified camp of the Caesars
developed into the castle of the king.  As we are as yet ignorant of
the names of the first kings of Mercia, no historian has been able
to guess which of them made it his ultimate defence; and I suppose
we shall never know now.  In process of time, as the arts of war
developed, it increased in size and strength, and although recorded
details are lacking, the history is written not merely in the stone
of its building, but is inferred in the changes of structure.  Then
the sweeping changes which followed the Norman Conquest wiped out
all lesser records than its own.  To-day we must accept it as one of
the earliest castles of the Conquest, probably not later than the
time of Henry I.  Roman and Norman were both wise in their retention
of places of approved strength or utility.  So it was that these
surrounding heights, already established and to a certain extent
proved, were retained.  Indeed, such characteristics as already
pertained to them were preserved, and to-day afford to us lessons
regarding things which have themselves long since passed away.

""So much for the fortified heights; but the hollows too have their
own story.  But how the time passes!  We must hurry home, or your
uncle will wonder what has become of us.""

He started with long steps towards Lesser Hill, and Adam was soon
furtively running in order to keep up with him.



CHAPTER IV--THE LADY ARABELLA MARCH



""Now, there is no hurry, but so soon as you are both ready we shall
start,"" Mr. Salton said when breakfast had begun.  ""I want to take
you first to see a remarkable relic of Mercia, and then we'll go to
Liverpool through what is called 'The Great Vale of Cheshire.'  You
may be disappointed, but take care not to prepare your mind""--this
to Adam--""for anything stupendous or heroic.  You would not think
the place a vale at all, unless you were told so beforehand, and had
confidence in the veracity of the teller.  We should get to the
Landing Stage in time to meet the WEST AFRICAN, and catch Mr.
Caswall as he comes ashore.  We want to do him honour--and, besides,
it will be more pleasant to have the introductions over before we go
to his FETE at the Castle.""

The carriage was ready, the same as had been used the previous day,
but there were different horses--magnificent animals, and keen for
work.  Breakfast was soon over, and they shortly took their places.
The postillions had their orders, and were quickly on their way at
an exhilarating pace.

Presently, in obedience to Mr. Salton's signal, the carriage drew up
opposite a great heap of stones by the wayside.

""Here, Adam,"" he said, ""is something that you of all men should not
pass by unnoticed.  That heap of stones brings us at once to the
dawn of the Anglian kingdom.  It was begun more than a thousand
years ago--in the latter part of the seventh century--in memory of a
murder.  Wulfere, King of Mercia, nephew of Penda, here murdered his
two sons for embracing Christianity.  As was the custom of the time,
each passer-by added a stone to the memorial heap.  Penda
represented heathen reaction after St. Augustine's mission.  Sir
Nathaniel can tell you as much as you want about this, and put you,
if you wish, on the track of such accurate knowledge as there is.""

Whilst they were looking at the heap of stones, they noticed that
another carriage had drawn up beside them, and the passenger--there
was only one--was regarding them curiously.  The carriage was an old
heavy travelling one, with arms blazoned on it gorgeously.  The men
took off their hats, as the occupant, a lady, addressed them.

""How do you do, Sir Nathaniel?  How do you do, Mr. Salton?  I hope
you have not met with any accident.  Look at me!""

As she spoke she pointed to where one of the heavy springs was
broken across, the broken metal showing bright.  Adam spoke up at
once:

""Oh, that can soon be put right.""

""Soon?  There is no one near who can mend a break like that.""

""I can.""

""You!""  She looked incredulously at the dapper young gentleman who
spoke.  ""You--why, it's a workman's job.""

""All right, I am a workman--though that is not the only sort of work
I do.  I am an Australian, and, as we have to move about fast, we
are all trained to farriery and such mechanics as come into travel--
I am quite at your service.""

""I hardly know how to thank you for your kindness, of which I gladly
avail myself.  I don't know what else I can do, as I wish to meet
Mr. Caswall of Castra Regis, who arrives home from Africa to-day.
It is a notable home-coming; all the countryside want to do him
honour.""  She looked at the old men and quickly made up her mind as
to the identity of the stranger.  ""You must be Mr. Adam Salton of
Lesser Hill.  I am Lady Arabella March of Diana's Grove.""  As she
spoke she turned slightly to Mr. Salton, who took the hint and made
a formal introduction.

So soon as this was done, Adam took some tools from his uncle's
carriage, and at once began work on the broken spring.  He was an
expert workman, and the breach was soon made good.  Adam was
gathering the tools which he had been using--which, after the manner
of all workmen, had been scattered about--when he noticed that
several black snakes had crawled out from the heap of stones and
were gathering round him.  This naturally occupied his mind, and he
was not thinking of anything else when he noticed Lady Arabella, who
had opened the door of the carriage, slip from it with a quick
gliding motion.  She was already among the snakes when he called out
to warn her.  But there seemed to be no need of warning.  The snakes
had turned and were wriggling back to the mound as quickly as they
could.  He laughed to himself behind his teeth as he whispered, ""No
need to fear there.  They seem much more afraid of her than she of
them.""  All the same he began to beat on the ground with a stick
which was lying close to him, with the instinct of one used to such
vermin.  In an instant he was alone beside the mound with Lady
Arabella, who appeared quite unconcerned at the incident.  Then he
took a long look at her, and her dress alone was sufficient to
attract attention.  She was clad in some kind of soft white stuff,
which clung close to her form, showing to the full every movement of
her sinuous figure.  She wore a close-fitting cap of some fine fur
of dazzling white.  Coiled round her white throat was a large
necklace of emeralds, whose profusion of colour dazzled when the sun
shone on them.  Her voice was peculiar, very low and sweet, and so
soft that the dominant note was of sibilation.  Her hands, too, were
peculiar--long, flexible, white, with a strange movement as of
waving gently to and fro.

She appeared quite at ease, and, after thanking Adam, said that if
any of his uncle's party were going to Liverpool she would be most
happy to join forces.

""Whilst you are staying here, Mr. Salton, you must look on the
grounds of Diana's Grove as your own, so that you may come and go
just as you do in Lesser Hill.  There are some fine views, and not a
few natural curiosities which are sure to interest you, if you are a
student of natural history--specially of an earlier kind, when the
world was younger.""

The heartiness with which she spoke, and the warmth of her words--
not of her manner, which was cold and distant--made him suspicious.
In the meantime both his uncle and Sir Nathaniel had thanked her for
the invitation--of which, however, they said they were unable to
avail themselves.  Adam had a suspicion that, though she answered
regretfully, she was in reality relieved.  When he had got into the
carriage with the two old men, and they had driven off, he was not
surprised when Sir Nathaniel spoke.

""I could not but feel that she was glad to be rid of us.  She can
play her game better alone!""

""What is her game?"" asked Adam unthinkingly.

""All the county knows it, my boy.  Caswall is a very rich man.  Her
husband was rich when she married him--or seemed to be.  When he
committed suicide, it was found that he had nothing left, and the
estate was mortgaged up to the hilt.  Her only hope is in a rich
marriage.  I suppose I need not draw any conclusion; you can do that
as well as I can.""

Adam remained silent nearly all the time they were travelling
through the alleged Vale of Cheshire.  He thought much during that
journey and came to several conclusions, though his lips were
unmoved.  One of these conclusions was that he would be very careful
about paying any attention to Lady Arabella.  He was himself a rich
man, how rich not even his uncle had the least idea, and would have
been surprised had he known.

The remainder of the journey was uneventful, and upon arrival at
Liverpool they went aboard the WEST AFRICAN, which had just come to
the landing-stage.  There his uncle introduced himself to Mr.
Caswall, and followed this up by introducing Sir Nathaniel and then
Adam.  The new-comer received them graciously, and said what a
pleasure it was to be coming home after so long an absence of his
family from their old seat.  Adam was pleased at the warmth of the
reception; but he could not avoid a feeling of repugnance at the
man's face.  He was trying hard to overcome this when a diversion
was caused by the arrival of Lady Arabella.  The diversion was
welcome to all; the two Saltons and Sir Nathaniel were shocked at
Caswall's face--so hard, so ruthless, so selfish, so dominant.  ""God
help any,"" was the common thought, ""who is under the domination of
such a man!""

Presently his African servant approached him, and at once their
thoughts changed to a larger toleration.  Caswall looked indeed a
savage--but a cultured savage.  In him were traces of the softening
civilisation of ages--of some of the higher instincts and education
of man, no matter how rudimentary these might be.  But the face of
Oolanga, as his master called him, was unreformed, unsoftened
savage, and inherent in it were all the hideous possibilities of a
lost, devil-ridden child of the forest and the swamp--the lowest of
all created things that could be regarded as in some form ostensibly
human.  Lady Arabella and Oolanga arrived almost simultaneously, and
Adam was surprised to notice what effect their appearance had on
each other.  The woman seemed as if she would not--could not--
condescend to exhibit any concern or interest in such a creature.
On the other hand, the negro's bearing was such as in itself to
justify her pride.  He treated her not merely as a slave treats his
master, but as a worshipper would treat a deity.  He knelt before
her with his hands out-stretched and his forehead in the dust.  So
long as she remained he did not move; it was only when she went over
to Caswall that he relaxed his attitude of devotion and stood by
respectfully.

Adam spoke to his own man, Davenport, who was standing by, having
arrived with the bailiff of Lesser Hill, who had followed Mr. Salton
in a pony trap.  As he spoke, he pointed to an attentive ship's
steward, and presently the two men were conversing.

""I think we ought to be moving,"" Mr. Salton said to Adam.  ""I have
some things to do in Liverpool, and I am sure that both Mr. Caswall
and Lady Arabella would like to get under weigh for Castra Regis.""

""I too, sir, would like to do something,"" replied Adam.  ""I want to
find out where Ross, the animal merchant, lives--I want to take a
small animal home with me, if you don't mind.  He is only a little
thing, and will be no trouble.""

""Of course not, my boy.  What kind of animal is it that you want?""

""A mongoose.""

""A mongoose!  What on earth do you want it for?""

""To kill snakes.""

""Good!""  The old man remembered the mound of stones.  No explanation
was needed.

When Ross heard what was wanted, he asked:

""Do you want something special, or will an ordinary mongoose do?""

""Well, of course I want a good one.  But I see no need for anything
special.  It is for ordinary use.""

""I can let you have a choice of ordinary ones.  I only asked,
because I have in stock a very special one which I got lately from
Nepaul.  He has a record of his own.  He killed a king cobra that
had been seen in the Rajah's garden.  But I don't suppose we have
any snakes of the kind in this cold climate--I daresay an ordinary
one will do.""

When Adam got back to the carriage, carefully carrying the box with
the mongoose, Sir Nathaniel said:  ""Hullo! what have you got there?""

""A mongoose.""

""What for?""

""To kill snakes!""

Sir Nathaniel laughed.

""I heard Lady Arabella's invitation to you to come to Diana's
Grove.""

""Well, what on earth has that got to do with it?""

""Nothing directly that I know of.  But we shall see.""  Adam waited,
and the old man went on:  ""Have you by any chance heard the other
name which was given long ago to that place.""

""No, sir.""

""It was called-- Look here, this subject wants a lot of talking
over.  Suppose we wait till we are alone and have lots of time
before us.""

""All right, sir.""  Adam was filled with curiosity, but he thought it
better not to hurry matters.  All would come in good time.  Then the
three men returned home, leaving Mr. Caswall to spend the night in
Liverpool.

The following day the Lesser Hill party set out for Castra Regis,
and for the time Adam thought no more of Diana's Grove or of what
mysteries it had contained--or might still contain.

The guests were crowding in, and special places were marked for
important people.  Adam, seeing so many persons of varied degree,
looked round for Lady Arabella, but could not locate her.  It was
only when he saw the old-fashioned travelling carriage approach and
heard the sound of cheering which went with it, that he realised
that Edgar Caswall had arrived.  Then, on looking more closely, he
saw that Lady Arabella, dressed as he had seen her last, was seated
beside him.  When the carriage drew up at the great flight of steps,
the host jumped down and gave her his hand.

It was evident to all that she was the chief guest at the
festivities.  It was not long before the seats on the dais were
filled, while the tenants and guests of lesser importance had
occupied all the coigns of vantage not reserved.  The order of the
day had been carefully arranged by a committee.  There were some
speeches, happily neither many nor long; and then festivities were
suspended till the time for feasting arrived.  In the interval
Caswall walked among his guests, speaking to all in a friendly
manner and expressing a general welcome.  The other guests came down
from the dais and followed his example, so there was unceremonious
meeting and greeting between gentle and simple.

Adam Salton naturally followed with his eyes all that went on within
their scope, taking note of all who seemed to afford any interest.
He was young and a man and a stranger from a far distance; so on all
these accounts he naturally took stock rather of the women than of
the men, and of these, those who were young and attractive.  There
were lots of pretty girls among the crowd, and Adam, who was a
handsome young man and well set up, got his full share of admiring
glances.  These did not concern him much, and he remained unmoved
until there came along a group of three, by their dress and bearing,
of the farmer class.  One was a sturdy old man; the other two were
good-looking girls, one of a little over twenty, the other not quite
so old.  So soon as Adam's eyes met those of the younger girl, who
stood nearest to him, some sort of electricity flashed--that divine
spark which begins by recognition, and ends in obedience.  Men call
it ""Love.""

Both his companions noticed how much Adam was taken by the pretty
girl, and spoke of her to him in a way which made his heart warm to
them.

""Did you notice that party that passed?  The old man is Michael
Watford, one of the tenants of Mr. Caswall.  He occupies Mercy Farm,
which Sir Nathaniel pointed out to you to-day.  The girls are his
grand-daughters, the elder, Lilla, being the only child of his elder
son, who died when she was less than a year old.  His wife died on
the same day.  She is a good girl--as good as she is pretty.  The
other is her first cousin, the daughter of Watford's second son.  He
went for a soldier when he was just over twenty, and was drafted
abroad.  He was not a good correspondent, though he was a good
enough son.  A few letters came, and then his father heard from the
colonel of his regiment that he had been killed by dacoits in
Burmah.  He heard from the same source that his boy had been married
to a Burmese, and that there was a daughter only a year old.
Watford had the child brought home, and she grew up beside Lilla.
The only thing that they heard of her birth was that her name was
Mimi.  The two children adored each other, and do to this day.
Strange how different they are!  Lilla all fair, like the old Saxon
stock from which she is sprung; Mimi showing a trace of her mother's
race.  Lilla is as gentle as a dove, but Mimi's black eyes can glow
whenever she is upset.  The only thing that upsets her is when
anything happens to injure or threaten or annoy Lilla.  Then her
eyes glow as do the eyes of a bird when her young are menaced.""



CHAPTER V--THE WHITE WORM



Mr. Salton introduced Adam to Mr. Watford and his grand-daughters,
and they all moved on together.  Of course neighbours in the
position of the Watfords knew all about Adam Salton, his
relationship, circumstances, and prospects.  So it would have been
strange indeed if both girls did not dream of possibilities of the
future.  In agricultural England, eligible men of any class are
rare.  This particular man was specially eligible, for he did not
belong to a class in which barriers of caste were strong.  So when
it began to be noticed that he walked beside Mimi Watford and seemed
to desire her society, all their friends endeavoured to give the
promising affair a helping hand.  When the gongs sounded for the
banquet, he went with her into the tent where her grandfather had
seats.  Mr. Salton and Sir Nathaniel noticed that the young man did
not come to claim his appointed place at the dais table; but they
understood and made no remark, or indeed did not seem to notice his
absence.

Lady Arabella sat as before at Edgar Caswall's right hand.  She was
certainly a striking and unusual woman, and to all it seemed fitting
from her rank and personal qualities that she should be the chosen
partner of the heir on his first appearance.  Of course nothing was
said openly by those of her own class who were present; but words
were not necessary when so much could be expressed by nods and
smiles.  It seemed to be an accepted thing that at last there was to
be a mistress of Castra Regis, and that she was present amongst
them.  There were not lacking some who, whilst admitting all her
charm and beauty, placed her in the second rank, Lilla Watford being
marked as first.  There was sufficient divergence of type, as well
as of individual beauty, to allow of fair comment; Lady Arabella
represented the aristocratic type, and Lilla that of the commonalty.

When the dusk began to thicken, Mr. Salton and Sir Nathaniel walked
home--the trap had been sent away early in the day--leaving Adam to
follow in his own time.  He came in earlier than was expected, and
seemed upset about something.  Neither of the elders made any
comment.  They all lit cigarettes, and, as dinner-time was close at
hand, went to their rooms to get ready.

Adam had evidently been thinking in the interval.  He joined the
others in the drawing-room, looking ruffled and impatient--a
condition of things seen for the first time.  The others, with the
patience--or the experience--of age, trusted to time to unfold and
explain things.  They had not long to wait.  After sitting down and
standing up several times, Adam suddenly burst out.

""That fellow seems to think he owns the earth.  Can't he let people
alone!  He seems to think that he has only to throw his handkerchief
to any woman, and be her master.""

This outburst was in itself enlightening.  Only thwarted affection
in some guise could produce this feeling in an amiable young man.
Sir Nathaniel, as an old diplomatist, had a way of understanding, as
if by foreknowledge, the true inwardness of things, and asked
suddenly, but in a matter-of-fact, indifferent voice:

""Was he after Lilla?""

""Yes, and the fellow didn't lose any time either.  Almost as soon as
they met, he began to butter her up, and tell her how beautiful she
was.  Why, before he left her side, he had asked himself to tea to-
morrow at Mercy Farm.  Stupid ass!  He might see that the girl isn't
his sort!  I never saw anything like it.  It was just like a hawk
and a pigeon.""

As he spoke, Sir Nathaniel turned and looked at Mr. Salton--a keen
look which implied a full understanding.

""Tell us all about it, Adam.  There are still a few minutes before
dinner, and we shall all have better appetites when we have come to
some conclusion on this matter.""

""There is nothing to tell, sir; that is the worst of it.  I am bound
to say that there was not a word said that a human being could
object to.  He was very civil, and all that was proper--just what a
landlord might be to a tenant's daughter. . . Yet--yet--well, I
don't know how it was, but it made my blood boil.""

""How did the hawk and the pigeon come in?""  Sir Nathaniel's voice
was soft and soothing, nothing of contradiction or overdone
curiosity in it--a tone eminently suited to win confidence.

""I can hardly explain.  I can only say that he looked like a hawk
and she like a dove--and, now that I think of it, that is what they
each did look like; and do look like in their normal condition.""

""That is so!"" came the soft voice of Sir Nathaniel.

Adam went on:

""Perhaps that early Roman look of his set me off.  But I wanted to
protect her; she seemed in danger.""

""She seems in danger, in a way, from all you young men.  I couldn't
help noticing the way that even you looked--as if you wished to
absorb her!""

""I hope both you young men will keep your heads cool,"" put in Mr.
Salton.  ""You know, Adam, it won't do to have any quarrel between
you, especially so soon after his home-coming and your arrival here.
We must think of the feelings and happiness of our neighbours;
mustn't we?""

""I hope so, sir.  I assure you that, whatever may happen, or even
threaten, I shall obey your wishes in this as in all things.""

""Hush!"" whispered Sir Nathaniel, who heard the servants in the
passage bringing dinner.

After dinner, over the walnuts and the wine, Sir Nathaniel returned
to the subject of the local legends.

""It will perhaps be a less dangerous topic for us to discuss than
more recent ones.""

""All right, sir,"" said Adam heartily.  ""I think you may depend on me
now with regard to any topic.  I can even discuss Mr. Caswall.
Indeed, I may meet him to-morrow.  He is going, as I said, to call
at Mercy Farm at three o'clock--but I have an appointment at two.""

""I notice,"" said Mr. Salton, ""that you do not lose any time.""

The two old men once more looked at each other steadily.  Then, lest
the mood of his listener should change with delay, Sir Nathaniel
began at once:

""I don't propose to tell you all the legends of Mercia, or even to
make a selection of them.  It will be better, I think, for our
purpose if we consider a few facts--recorded or unrecorded--about
this neighbourhood.  I think we might begin with Diana's Grove.  It
has roots in the different epochs of our history, and each has its
special crop of legend.  The Druid and the Roman are too far off for
matters of detail; but it seems to me the Saxon and the Angles are
near enough to yield material for legendary lore.  We find that this
particular place had another name besides Diana's Grove.  This was
manifestly of Roman origin, or of Grecian accepted as Roman.  The
other is more pregnant of adventure and romance than the Roman name.
In Mercian tongue it was 'The Lair of the White Worm.'  This needs a
word of explanation at the beginning.

""In the dawn of the language, the word 'worm' had a somewhat
different meaning from that in use to-day.  It was an adaptation of
the Anglo-Saxon 'wyrm,' meaning a dragon or snake; or from the
Gothic 'waurms,' a serpent; or the Icelandic 'ormur,' or the German
'wurm.'  We gather that it conveyed originally an idea of size and
power, not as now in the diminutive of both these meanings.  Here
legendary history helps us.  We have the well-known legend of the
'Worm Well' of Lambton Castle, and that of the 'Laidly Worm of
Spindleston Heugh' near Bamborough.  In both these legends the
'worm' was a monster of vast size and power--a veritable dragon or
serpent, such as legend attributes to vast fens or quags where there
was illimitable room for expansion.  A glance at a geological map
will show that whatever truth there may have been of the actuality
of such monsters in the early geologic periods, at least there was
plenty of possibility.  In England there were originally vast plains
where the plentiful supply of water could gather.  The streams were
deep and slow, and there were holes of abysmal depth, where any kind
and size of antediluvian monster could find a habitat.  In places,
which now we can see from our windows, were mud-holes a hundred or
more feet deep.  Who can tell us when the age of the monsters which
flourished in slime came to an end?  There must have been places and
conditions which made for greater longevity, greater size, greater
strength than was usual.  Such over-lappings may have come down even
to our earlier centuries.  Nay, are there not now creatures of a
vastness of bulk regarded by the generality of men as impossible?
Even in our own day there are seen the traces of animals, if not the
animals themselves, of stupendous size--veritable survivals from
earlier ages, preserved by some special qualities in their habitats.
I remember meeting a distinguished man in India, who had the
reputation of being a great shikaree, who told me that the greatest
temptation he had ever had in his life was to shoot a giant snake
which he had come across in the Terai of Upper India.  He was on a
tiger-shooting expedition, and as his elephant was crossing a
nullah, it squealed.  He looked down from his howdah and saw that
the elephant had stepped across the body of a snake which was
dragging itself through the jungle.  'So far as I could see,' he
said, 'it must have been eighty or one hundred feet in length.
Fully forty or fifty feet was on each side of the track, and though
the weight which it dragged had thinned it, it was as thick round as
a man's body.  I suppose you know that when you are after tiger, it
is a point of honour not to shoot at anything else, as life may
depend on it.  I could easily have spined this monster, but I felt
that I must not--so, with regret, I had to let it go.'

""Just imagine such a monster anywhere in this country, and at once
we could get a sort of idea of the 'worms,' which possibly did
frequent the great morasses which spread round the mouths of many of
the great European rivers.""

""I haven't the least doubt, sir, that there may have been such
monsters as you have spoken of still existing at a much later period
than is generally accepted,"" replied Adam.  ""Also, if there were
such things, that this was the very place for them.  I have tried to
think over the matter since you pointed out the configuration of the
ground.  But it seems to me that there is a hiatus somewhere.  Are
there not mechanical difficulties?""

""In what way?""

""Well, our antique monster must have been mighty heavy, and the
distances he had to travel were long and the ways difficult.  From
where we are now sitting down to the level of the mud-holes is a
distance of several hundred feet--I am leaving out of consideration
altogether any lateral distance.  Is it possible that there was a
way by which a monster could travel up and down, and yet no chance
recorder have ever seen him?  Of course we have the legends; but is
not some more exact evidence necessary in a scientific
investigation?""

""My dear Adam, all you say is perfectly right, and, were we starting
on such an investigation, we could not do better than follow your
reasoning.  But, my dear boy, you must remember that all this took
place thousands of years ago.  You must remember, too, that all
records of the kind that would help us are lacking.  Also, that the
places to be considered were desert, so far as human habitation or
population are considered.  In the vast desolation of such a place
as complied with the necessary conditions, there must have been such
profusion of natural growth as would bar the progress of men formed
as we are.  The lair of such a monster would not have been disturbed
for hundreds--or thousands--of years.  Moreover, these creatures
must have occupied places quite inaccessible to man.  A snake who
could make himself comfortable in a quagmire, a hundred feet deep,
would be protected on the outskirts by such stupendous morasses as
now no longer exist, or which, if they exist anywhere at all, can be
on very few places on the earth's surface.  Far be it from me to say
that in more elemental times such things could not have been.  The
condition belongs to the geologic age--the great birth and growth of
the world, when natural forces ran riot, when the struggle for
existence was so savage that no vitality which was not founded in a
gigantic form could have even a possibility of survival.  That such
a time existed, we have evidences in geology, but there only; we can
never expect proofs such as this age demands.  We can only imagine
or surmise such things--or such conditions and such forces as
overcame them.""



CHAPTER VI--HAWK AND PIGEON



At breakfast-time next morning Sir Nathaniel and Mr. Salton were
seated when Adam came hurriedly into the room.

""Any news?"" asked his uncle mechanically.

""Four.""

""Four what?"" asked Sir Nathaniel.

""Snakes,"" said Adam, helping himself to a grilled kidney.

""Four snakes.  I don't understand.""

""Mongoose,"" said Adam, and then added explanatorily:  ""I was out
with the mongoose just after three.""

""Four snakes in one morning!  Why, I didn't know there were so many
on the Brow""--the local name for the western cliff.  ""I hope that
wasn't the consequence of our talk of last night?""

""It was, sir.  But not directly.""

""But, God bless my soul, you didn't expect to get a snake like the
Lambton worm, did you?  Why, a mongoose, to tackle a monster like
that--if there were one--would have to be bigger than a haystack.""

""These were ordinary snakes, about as big as a walking-stick.""

""Well, it's pleasant to be rid of them, big or little.  That is a
good mongoose, I am sure; he'll clear out all such vermin round
here,"" said Mr. Salton.

Adam went quietly on with his breakfast.  Killing a few snakes in a
morning was no new experience to him.  He left the room the moment
breakfast was finished and went to the study that his uncle had
arranged for him.  Both Sir Nathaniel and Mr. Salton took it that he
wanted to be by himself, so as to avoid any questioning or talk of
the visit that he was to make that afternoon.  They saw nothing
further of him till about half-an-hour before dinner-time.  Then he
came quietly into the smoking-room, where Mr. Salton and Sir
Nathaniel were sitting together, ready dressed.

""I suppose there is no use waiting.  We had better get it over at
once,"" remarked Adam.

His uncle, thinking to make things easier for him, said:  ""Get what
over?""

There was a sign of shyness about him at this.  He stammered a
little at first, but his voice became more even as he went on.

""My visit to Mercy Farm.""

Mr. Salton waited eagerly.  The old diplomatist simply smiled.

""I suppose you both know that I was much interested yesterday in the
Watfords?""  There was no denial or fending off the question.  Both
the old men smiled acquiescence.  Adam went on:  ""I meant you to see
it--both of you.  You, uncle, because you are my uncle and the
nearest of my own kin, and, moreover, you couldn't have been more
kind to me or made me more welcome if you had been my own father.""
Mr. Salton said nothing.  He simply held out his hand, and the other
took it and held it for a few seconds.  ""And you, sir, because you
have shown me something of the same affection which in my wildest
dreams of home I had no right to expect.""  He stopped for an
instant, much moved.

Sir Nathaniel answered softly, laying his hand on the youth's
shoulder.

""You are right, my boy; quite right.  That is the proper way to look
at it.  And I may tell you that we old men, who have no children of
our own, feel our hearts growing warm when we hear words like
those.""

Then Adam hurried on, speaking with a rush, as if he wanted to come
to the crucial point.

""Mr. Watford had not come in, but Lilla and Mimi were at home, and
they made me feel very welcome.  They have all a great regard for my
uncle.  I am glad of that any way, for I like them all--much.  We
were having tea, when Mr. Caswall came to the door, attended by the
negro.  Lilla opened the door herself.  The window of the living-
room at the farm is a large one, and from within you cannot help
seeing anyone coming.  Mr. Caswall said he had ventured to call, as
he wished to make the acquaintance of all his tenants, in a less
formal way, and more individually, than had been possible to him on
the previous day.  The girls made him welcome--they are very sweet
girls those, sir; someone will be very happy some day there--with
either of them.""

""And that man may be you, Adam,"" said Mr. Salton heartily.

A sad look came over the young man's eyes, and the fire his uncle
had seen there died out.  Likewise the timbre left his voice, making
it sound lonely.

""Such might crown my life.  But that happiness, I fear, is not for
me--or not without pain and loss and woe.""

""Well, it's early days yet!"" cried Sir Nathaniel heartily.

The young man turned on him his eyes, which had now grown
excessively sad.

""Yesterday--a few hours ago--that remark would have given me new
hope--new courage; but since then I have learned too much.""

The old man, skilled in the human heart, did not attempt to argue in
such a matter.

""Too early to give in, my boy.""

""I am not of a giving-in kind,"" replied the young man earnestly.
""But, after all, it is wise to realise a truth.  And when a man,
though he is young, feels as I do--as I have felt ever since
yesterday, when I first saw Mimi's eyes--his heart jumps.  He does
not need to learn things.  He knows.""

There was silence in the room, during which the twilight stole on
imperceptibly.  It was Adam who again broke the silence.

""Do you know, uncle, if we have any second sight in our family?""

""No, not that I ever heard about.  Why?""

""Because,"" he answered slowly, ""I have a conviction which seems to
answer all the conditions of second sight.""

""And then?"" asked the old man, much perturbed.

""And then the usual inevitable.  What in the Hebrides and other
places, where the Sight is a cult--a belief--is called 'the doom'--
the court from which there is no appeal.  I have often heard of
second sight--we have many western Scots in Australia; but I have
realised more of its true inwardness in an instant of this afternoon
than I did in the whole of my life previously--a granite wall
stretching up to the very heavens, so high and so dark that the eye
of God Himself cannot see beyond.  Well, if the Doom must come, it
must.  That is all.""

The voice of Sir Nathaniel broke in, smooth and sweet and grave.

""Can there not be a fight for it?  There can for most things.""

""For most things, yes, but for the Doom, no.  What a man can do I
shall do.  There will be--must be--a fight.  When and where and how
I know not, but a fight there will be.  But, after all, what is a
man in such a case?""

""Adam, there are three of us.""  Salton looked at his old friend as
he spoke, and that old friend's eyes blazed.

""Ay, three of us,"" he said, and his voice rang.

There was again a pause, and Sir Nathaniel endeavoured to get back
to less emotional and more neutral ground.

""Tell us of the rest of the meeting.  Remember we are all pledged to
this.  It is a fight E L'OUTRANCE, and we can afford to throw away
or forgo no chance.""

""We shall throw away or lose nothing that we can help.  We fight to
win, and the stake is a life--perhaps more than one--we shall see.""
Then he went on in a conversational tone, such as he had used when
he spoke of the coming to the farm of Edgar Caswall:  ""When Mr.
Caswall came in, the negro went a short distance away and there
remained.  It gave me the idea that he expected to be called, and
intended to remain in sight, or within hail.  Then Mimi got another
cup and made fresh tea, and we all went on together.""

""Was there anything uncommon--were you all quite friendly?"" asked
Sir Nathaniel quietly.

""Quite friendly.  There was nothing that I could notice out of the
common--except,"" he went on, with a slight hardening of the voice,
""except that he kept his eyes fixed on Lilla, in a way which was
quite intolerable to any man who might hold her dear.""

""Now, in what way did he look?"" asked Sir Nathaniel.

""There was nothing in itself offensive; but no one could help
noticing it.""

""You did.  Miss Watford herself, who was the victim, and Mr.
Caswall, who was the offender, are out of range as witnesses.  Was
there anyone else who noticed?""

""Mimi did.  Her face flamed with anger as she saw the look.""

""What kind of look was it?  Over-ardent or too admiring, or what?
Was it the look of a lover, or one who fain would be?  You
understand?""

""Yes, sir, I quite understand.  Anything of that sort I should of
course notice.  It would be part of my preparation for keeping my
self-control--to which I am pledged.""

""If it were not amatory, was it threatening?  Where was the
offence?""

Adam smiled kindly at the old man.

""It was not amatory.  Even if it was, such was to be expected.  I
should be the last man in the world to object, since I am myself an
offender in that respect.  Moreover, not only have I been taught to
fight fair, but by nature I believe I am just.  I would be as
tolerant of and as liberal to a rival as I should expect him to be
to me.  No, the look I mean was nothing of that kind.  And so long
as it did not lack proper respect, I should not of my own part
condescend to notice it.  Did you ever study the eyes of a hound?""

""At rest?""

""No, when he is following his instincts!  Or, better still,"" Adam
went on, ""the eyes of a bird of prey when he is following his
instincts.  Not when he is swooping, but merely when he is watching
his quarry?""

""No,"" said Sir Nathaniel, ""I don't know that I ever did.  Why, may I
ask?""

""That was the look.  Certainly not amatory or anything of that kind-
-yet it was, it struck me, more dangeroouss, if not so deadly as an
actual threatening.""

Again there was a silence, which Sir Nathaniel broke as he stood up:

""I think it would be well if we all thought over this by ourselves.
Then we can renew the subject.""



CHAPTER VII--OOLANGA



Mr. Salton had an appointment for six o'clock at Liverpool.  When he
had driven off, Sir Nathaniel took Adam by the arm.

""May I come with you for a while to your study?  I want to speak to
you privately without your uncle knowing about it, or even what the
subject is.  You don't mind, do you?  It is not idle curiosity.  No,
no.  It is on the subject to which we are all committed.""

""Is it necessary to keep my uncle in the dark about it?  He might be
offended.""

""It is not necessary; but it is advisable.  It is for his sake that
I asked.  My friend is an old man, and it might concern him unduly--
even alarm him.  I promise you there shall be nothing that could
cause him anxiety in our silence, or at which he could take
umbrage.""

""Go on, sir!"" said Adam simply.

""You see, your uncle is now an old man.  I know it, for we were boys
together.  He has led an uneventful and somewhat self-contained
life, so that any such condition of things as has now arisen is apt
to perplex him from its very strangeness.  In fact, any new matter
is trying to old people.  It has its own disturbances and its own
anxieties, and neither of these things are good for lives that
should be restful.  Your uncle is a strong man, with a very happy
and placid nature.  Given health and ordinary conditions of life,
there is no reason why he should not live to be a hundred.  You and
I, therefore, who both love him, though in different ways, should
make it our business to protect him from all disturbing influences.
I am sure you will agree with me that any labour to this end would
be well spent.  All right, my boy!  I see your answer in your eyes;
so we need say no more of that.  And now,"" here his voice changed,
""tell me all that took place at that interview.  There are strange
things in front of us--how strange we cannot at present even guess.
Doubtless some of the difficult things to understand which lie
behind the veil will in time be shown to us to see and to
understand.  In the meantime, all we can do is to work patiently,
fearlessly, and unselfishly, to an end that we think is right.  You
had got so far as where Lilla opened the door to Mr. Caswall and the
negro.  You also observed that Mimi was disturbed in her mind at the
way Mr. Caswall looked at her cousin.""

""Certainly--though 'disturbed' is a poor way of expressing her
objection.""

""Can you remember well enough to describe Caswall's eyes, and how
Lilla looked, and what Mimi said and did?  Also Oolanga, Caswall's
West African servant.""

""I'll do what I can, sir.  All the time Mr. Caswall was staring, he
kept his eyes fixed and motionless--but not as if he was in a
trance.  His forehead was wrinkled up, as it is when one is trying
to see through or into something.  At the best of times his face has
not a gentle expression; but when it was screwed up like that it was
almost diabolical.  It frightened poor Lilla so that she trembled,
and after a bit got so pale that I thought she had fainted.
However, she held up and tried to stare back, but in a feeble kind
of way.  Then Mimi came close and held her hand.  That braced her
up, and--still, never ceasing her return stare--she got colour again
and seemed more like herself.""

""Did he stare too?""

""More than ever.  The weaker Lilla seemed, the stronger he became,
just as if he were feeding on her strength.  All at once she turned
round, threw up her hands, and fell down in a faint.  I could not
see what else happened just then, for Mimi had thrown herself on her
knees beside her and hid her from me.  Then there was something like
a black shadow between us, and there was the nigger, looking more
like a malignant devil than ever.  I am not usually a patient man,
and the sight of that ugly devil is enough to make one's blood boil.
When he saw my face, he seemed to realise danger--immediate danger--
and slunk out of the room as noiselessly as if he had been blown
out.  I learned one thing, however--he is an enemy, if ever a man
had one.""

""That still leaves us three to two!"" put in Sir Nathaniel.

""Then Caswall slunk out, much as the nigger had done.  When he had
gone, Lilla recovered at once.""

""Now,"" said Sir Nathaniel, anxious to restore peace, ""have you found
out anything yet regarding the negro?  I am anxious to be posted
regarding him.  I fear there will be, or may be, grave trouble with
him.""

""Yes, sir, I've heard a good deal about him--of course it is not
official; but hearsay must guide us at first.  You know my man
Davenport--private secretary, confidential man of business, and
general factotum.  He is devoted to me, and has my full confidence.
I asked him to stay on board the WEST AFRICAN and have a good look
round, and find out what he could about Mr. Caswall.  Naturally, he
was struck with the aboriginal savage.  He found one of the ship's
stewards, who had been on the regular voyages to South Africa.  He
knew Oolanga and had made a study of him.  He is a man who gets on
well with niggers, and they open their hearts to him.  It seems that
this Oolanga is quite a great person in the nigger world of the
African West Coast.  He has the two things which men of his own
colour respect:  he can make them afraid, and he is lavish with
money.  I don't know whose money--but that does not matter.  They
are always ready to trumpet his greatness.  Evil greatness it is--
but neither does that matter.  Briefly, this is his history.  He was
originally a witch-finder--about as low an occupation as exists
amongst aboriginal savages.  Then he got up in the world and became
an Obi-man, which gives an opportunity to wealth VIA blackmail.
Finally, he reached the highest honour in hellish service.  He
became a user of Voodoo, which seems to be a service of the utmost
baseness and cruelty.  I was told some of his deeds of cruelty,
which are simply sickening.  They made me long for an opportunity of
helping to drive him back to hell.  You might think to look at him
that you could measure in some way the extent of his vileness; but
it would be a vain hope.  Monsters such as he is belong to an
earlier and more rudimentary stage of barbarism.  He is in his way a
clever fellow--for a nigger; but is none the less dangerous or the
less hateful for that.  The men in the ship told me that he was a
collector:  some of them had seen his collections.  Such
collections!  All that was potent for evil in bird or beast, or even
in fish.  Beaks that could break and rend and tear--all the birds
represented were of a predatory kind.  Even the fishes are those
which are born to destroy, to wound, to torture.  The collection, I
assure you, was an object lesson in human malignity.  This being has
enough evil in his face to frighten even a strong man.  It is little
wonder that the sight of it put that poor girl into a dead faint!""

Nothing more could be done at the moment, so they separated.

Adam was up in the early morning and took a smart walk round the
Brow.  As he was passing Diana's Grove, he looked in on the short
avenue of trees, and noticed the snakes killed on the previous
morning by the mongoose.  They all lay in a row, straight and rigid,
as if they had been placed by hands.  Their skins seemed damp and
sticky, and they were covered all over with ants and other insects.
They looked loathsome, so after a glance, he passed on.

A little later, when his steps took him, naturally enough, past the
entrance to Mercy Farm, he was passed by the negro, moving quickly
under the trees wherever there was shadow.  Laid across one extended
arm, looking like dirty towels across a rail, he had the horrid-
looking snakes.  He did not seem to see Adam.  No one was to be seen
at Mercy except a few workmen in the farmyard, so, after waiting on
the chance of seeing Mimi, Adam began to go slowly home.

Once more he was passed on the way.  This time it was by Lady
Arabella, walking hurriedly and so furiously angry that she did not
recognise him, even to the extent of acknowledging his bow.

When Adam got back to Lesser Hill, he went to the coach-house where
the box with the mongoose was kept, and took it with him, intending
to finish at the Mound of Stone what he had begun the previous
morning with regard to the extermination.  He found that the snakes
were even more easily attacked than on the previous day; no less
than six were killed in the first half-hour.  As no more appeared,
he took it for granted that the morning's work was over, and went
towards home.  The mongoose had by this time become accustomed to
him, and was willing to let himself be handled freely.  Adam lifted
him up and put him on his shoulder and walked on.  Presently he saw
a lady advancing towards him, and recognised Lady Arabella.

Hitherto the mongoose had been quiet, like a playful affectionate
kitten; but when the two got close, Adam was horrified to see the
mongoose, in a state of the wildest fury, with every hair standing
on end, jump from his shoulder and run towards Lady Arabella.  It
looked so furious and so intent on attack that he called a warning.

""Look out--look out!  The animal is furious and means to attack.""

Lady Arabella looked more than ever disdainful and was passing on;
the mongoose jumped at her in a furious attack.  Adam rushed forward
with his stick, the only weapon he had.  But just as he got within
striking distance, the lady drew out a revolver and shot the animal,
breaking his backbone.  Not satisfied with this, she poured shot
after shot into him till the magazine was exhausted.  There was no
coolness or hauteur about her now; she seemed more furious even than
the animal, her face transformed with hate, and as determined to
kill as he had appeared to be.  Adam, not knowing exactly what to
do, lifted his hat in apology and hurried on to Lesser Hill.



CHAPTER VIII--SURVIVALS



At breakfast Sir Nathaniel noticed that Adam was put out about
something, but he said nothing.  The lesson of silence is better
remembered in age than in youth.  When they were both in the study,
where Sir Nathaniel followed him, Adam at once began to tell his
companion of what had happened.  Sir Nathaniel looked graver and
graver as the narration proceeded, and when Adam had stopped he
remained silent for several minutes, before speaking.

""This is very grave.  I have not formed any opinion yet; but it
seems to me at first impression that this is worse than anything I
had expected.""

""Why, sir?"" said Adam.  ""Is the killing of a mongoose--no matter by
whom--so serious a thing as all that?""

His companion smoked on quietly for quite another few minutes before
he spoke.

""When I have properly thought it over I may moderate my opinion, but
in the meantime it seems to me that there is something dreadful
behind all this--something that may affect all our lives--that may
mean the issue of life or death to any of us.""

Adam sat up quickly.

""Do tell me, sir, what is in your mind--if, of course, you have no
objection, or do not think it better to withhold it.""

""I have no objection, Adam--in fact, if I had, I should have to
overcome it.  I fear there can be no more reserved thoughts between
us.""

""Indeed, sir, that sounds serious, worse than serious!""

""Adam, I greatly fear that the time has come for us--for you and me,
at all events--to speak out plainly to one another.  Does not there
seem something very mysterious about this?""

""I have thought so, sir, all along.  The only difficulty one has is
what one is to think and where to begin.""

""Let us begin with what you have told me.  First take the conduct of
the mongoose.  He was quiet, even friendly and affectionate with
you.  He only attacked the snakes, which is, after all, his business
in life.""

""That is so!""

""Then we must try to find some reason why he attacked Lady
Arabella.""

""May it not be that a mongoose may have merely the instinct to
attack, that nature does not allow or provide him with the fine
reasoning powers to discriminate who he is to attack?""

""Of course that may be so.  But, on the other hand, should we not
satisfy ourselves why he does wish to attack anything?  If for
centuries, this particular animal is known to attack only one kind
of other animal, are we not justified in assuming that when one of
them attacks a hitherto unclassed animal, he recognises in that
animal some quality which it has in common with the hereditary
enemy?""

""That is a good argument, sir,"" Adam went on, ""but a dangerous one.
If we followed it out, it would lead us to believe that Lady
Arabella is a snake.""

""We must be sure, before going to such an end, that there is no
point as yet unconsidered which would account for the unknown thing
which puzzles us.""

""In what way?""

""Well, suppose the instinct works on some physical basis--for
instance, smell.  If there were anything in recent juxtaposition to
the attacked which would carry the scent, surely that would supply
the missing cause.""

""Of course!"" Adam spoke with conviction.

""Now, from what you tell me, the negro had just come from the
direction of Diana's Grove, carrying the dead snakes which the
mongoose had killed the previous morning.  Might not the scent have
been carried that way?""

""Of course it might, and probably was.  I never thought of that.  Is
there any possible way of guessing approximately how long a scent
will remain?  You see, this is a natural scent, and may derive from
a place where it has been effective for thousands of years.  Then,
does a scent of any kind carry with it any form or quality of
another kind, either good or evil?  I ask you because one ancient
name of the house lived in by the lady who was attacked by the
mongoose was 'The Lair of the White Worm.'  If any of these things
be so, our difficulties have multiplied indefinitely.  They may even
change in kind.  We may get into moral entanglements; before we know
it, we may be in the midst of a struggle between good and evil.""

Sir Nathaniel smiled gravely.

""With regard to the first question--so far as I know, there are no
fixed periods for which a scent may be active--I think we may take
it that that period does not run into thousands of years.  As to
whether any moral change accompanies a physical one, I can only say
that I have met no proof of the fact.  At the same time, we must
remember that 'good' and 'evil' are terms so wide as to take in the
whole scheme of creation, and all that is implied by them and by
their mutual action and reaction.  Generally, I would say that in
the scheme of a First Cause anything is possible.  So long as the
inherent forces or tendencies of any one thing are veiled from us we
must expect mystery.""

""There is one other question on which I should like to ask your
opinion.  Suppose that there are any permanent forces appertaining
to the past, what we may call 'survivals,' do these belong to good
as well as to evil?  For instance, if the scent of the primaeval
monster can so remain in proportion to the original strength, can
the same be true of things of good import?""

Sir Nathaniel thought for a while before he answered.

""We must be careful not to confuse the physical and the moral.  I
can see that already you have switched on the moral entirely, so
perhaps we had better follow it up first.  On the side of the moral,
we have certain justification for belief in the utterances of
revealed religion.  For instance, 'the effectual fervent prayer of a
righteous man availeth much' is altogether for good.  We have
nothing of a similar kind on the side of evil.  But if we accept
this dictum we need have no more fear of 'mysteries':  these become
thenceforth merely obstacles.""

Adam suddenly changed to another phase of the subject.

""And now, sir, may I turn for a few minutes to purely practical
things, or rather to matters of historical fact?""

Sir Nathaniel bowed acquiescence.

""We have already spoken of the history, so far as it is known, of
some of the places round us--'Castra Regis,' 'Diana's Grove,' and
'The Lair of the White Worm.'  I would like to ask if there is
anything not necessarily of evil import about any of the places?""

""Which?"" asked Sir Nathaniel shrewdly.

""Well, for instance, this house and Mercy Farm?""

""Here we turn,"" said Sir Nathaniel, ""to the other side, the light
side of things.  Let us take Mercy Farm first.  When Augustine was
sent by Pope Gregory to Christianise England, in the time of the
Romans, he was received and protected by Ethelbert, King of Kent,
whose wife, daughter of Charibert, King of Paris, was a Christian,
and did much for Augustine.  She founded a nunnery in memory of
Columba, which was named SEDES MISERICORDIOE, the House of Mercy,
and, as the region was Mercian, the two names became involved.  As
Columba is the Latin for dove, the dove became a sort of
signification of the nunnery.  She seized on the idea and made the
newly-founded nunnery a house of doves.  Someone sent her a freshly-
discovered dove, a sort of carrier, but which had in the white
feathers of its head and neck the form of a religious cowl.  The
nunnery flourished for more than a century, when, in the time of
Penda, who was the reactionary of heathendom, it fell into decay.
In the meantime the doves, protected by religious feeling, had
increased mightily, and were known in all Catholic communities.
When King Offa ruled in Mercia, about a hundred and fifty years
later, he restored Christianity, and under its protection the
nunnery of St. Columba was restored and its doves flourished again.
In process of time this religious house again fell into desuetude;
but before it disappeared it had achieved a great name for good
works, and in especial for the piety of its members.  If deeds and
prayers and hopes and earnest thinking leave anywhere any moral
effect, Mercy Farm and all around it have almost the right to be
considered holy ground.""

""Thank you, sir,"" said Adam earnestly, and was silent.  Sir
Nathaniel understood.

After lunch that day, Adam casually asked Sir Nathaniel to come for
a walk with him.  The keen-witted old diplomatist guessed that there
must be some motive behind the suggestion, and he at once agreed.

As soon as they were free from observation, Adam began.

""I am afraid, sir, that there is more going on in this neighbourhood
than most people imagine.  I was out this morning, and on the edge
of the small wood, I came upon the body of a child by the roadside.
At first, I thought she was dead, and while examining her, I noticed
on her neck some marks that looked like those of teeth.""

""Some wild dog, perhaps?"" put in Sir Nathaniel.

""Possibly, sir, though I think not--but listen to the rest of my
news.  I glanced around, and to my surprise, I noticed something
white moving among the trees.  I placed the child down carefully,
and followed, but I could not find any further traces.  So I
returned to the child and resumed my examination, and, to my
delight, I discovered that she was still alive.  I chafed her hands
and gradually she revived, but to my disappointment she remembered
nothing--except that something had crept up quietly from behind, and
had gripped her round the throat.  Then, apparently, she fainted.""

""Gripped her round the throat!  Then it cannot have been a dog.""

""No, sir, that is my difficulty, and explains why I brought you out
here, where we cannot possibly be overheard.  You have noticed, of
course, the peculiar sinuous way in which Lady Arabella moves--well,
I feel certain that the white thing that I saw in the wood was the
mistress of Diana's Grove!""

""Good God, boy, be careful what you say.""

""Yes, sir, I fully realise the gravity of my accusation, but I feel
convinced that the marks on the child's throat were human--and made
by a woman.""

Adam's companion remained silent for some time, deep in thought.

""Adam, my boy,"" he said at last, ""this matter appears to me to be
far more serious even than you think.  It forces me to break
confidence with my old friend, your uncle--but, in order to spare
him, I must do so.  For some time now, things have been happening in
this district that have been worrying him dreadfully--several people
have disappeared, without leaving the slightest trace; a dead child
was found by the roadside, with no visible or ascertainable cause of
death--sheep and other animals have been found in the fields,
bleeding from open wounds.  There have been other matters--many of
them apparently trivial in themselves.  Some sinister influence has
been at work, and I admit that I have suspected Lady Arabella--that
is why I questioned you so closely about the mongoose and its
strange attack upon Lady Arabella.  You will think it strange that I
should suspect the mistress of Diana's Grove, a beautiful woman of
aristocratic birth.  Let me explain--the family seat is near my own
place, Doom Tower, and at one time I knew the family well.  When
still a young girl, Lady Arabella wandered into a small wood near
her home, and did not return.  She was found unconscious and in a
high fever--the doctor said that she had received a poisonous bite,
and the girl being at a delicate and critical age, the result was
serious--so much so that she was not expected to recover.  A great
London physician came down but could do nothing--indeed, he said
that the girl would not survive the night.  All hope had been
abandoned, when, to everyone's surprise, Lady Arabella made a sudden
and startling recovery.  Within a couple of days she was going about
as usual!  But to the horror of her people, she developed a terrible
craving for cruelty, maiming and injuring birds and small animals--
even killing them.  This was put down to a nervous disturbance due
to her age, and it was hoped that her marriage to Captain March
would put this right.  However, it was not a happy marriage, and
eventually her husband was found shot through the head.  I have
always suspected suicide, though no pistol was found near the body.
He may have discovered something--God knows what!--so possibly Lady
Arabella may herself have killed him.  Putting together many small
matters that have come to my knowledge, I have come to the
conclusion that the foul White Worm obtained control of her body,
just as her soul was leaving its earthly tenement--that would
explain the sudden revival of energy, the strange and inexplicable
craving for maiming and killing, as well as many other matters with
which I need not trouble you now, Adam.  As I said just now, God
alone knows what poor Captain March discovered--it must have been
something too ghastly for human endurance, if my theory is correct
that the once beautiful human body of Lady Arabella is under the
control of this ghastly White Worm.""

Adam nodded.

""But what can we do, sir--it seems a most difficult problem.""

""We can do nothing, my boy--that is the important part of it.  It
would be impossible to take action--all we can do is to keep careful
watch, especially as regards Lady Arabella, and be ready to act,
promptly and decisively, if the opportunity occurs.""

Adam agreed, and the two men returned to Lesser Hill.



CHAPTER IX--SMELLING DEATH



Adam Salton, though he talked little, did not let the grass grow
under his feet in any matter which he had undertaken, or in which he
was interested.  He had agreed with Sir Nathaniel that they should
not do anything with regard to the mystery of Lady Arabella's fear
of the mongoose, but he steadily pursued his course in being
PREPARED to act whenever the opportunity might come.  He was in his
own mind perpetually casting about for information or clues which
might lead to possible lines of action.  Baffled by the killing of
the mongoose, he looked around for another line to follow.  He was
fascinated by the idea of there being a mysterious link between the
woman and the animal, but he was already preparing a second string
to his bow.  His new idea was to use the faculties of Oolanga, so
far as he could, in the service of discovery.  His first move was to
send Davenport to Liverpool to try to find the steward of the WEST
AFRICAN, who had told him about Oolanga, and if possible secure any
further information, and then try to induce (by bribery or other
means) the nigger to come to the Brow.  So soon as he himself could
have speech of the Voodoo-man he would be able to learn from him
something useful.  Davenport was successful in his missions, for he
had to get another mongoose, and he was able to tell Adam that he
had seen the steward, who told him much that he wanted to know, and
had also arranged for Oolanga to come to Lesser Hill the following
day.  At this point Adam saw his way sufficiently clear to admit
Davenport to some extent into his confidence.  He had come to the
conclusion that it would be better--certainly at first--not himself
to appear in the matter, with which Davenport was fully competent to
deal.  It would be time for himself to take a personal part when
matters had advanced a little further.

If what the nigger said was in any wise true, the man had a rare
gift which might be useful in the quest they were after.  He could,
as it were, ""smell death.""  If any one was dead, if any one had
died, or if a place had been used in connection with death, he
seemed to know the broad fact by intuition.  Adam made up his mind
that to test this faculty with regard to several places would be his
first task.  Naturally he was anxious, and the time passed slowly.
The only comfort was the arrival the next morning of a strong
packing case, locked, from Ross, the key being in the custody of
Davenport.  In the case were two smaller boxes, both locked.  One of
them contained a mongoose to replace that killed by Lady Arabella;
the other was the special mongoose which had already killed the
king-cobra in Nepaul.  When both the animals had been safely put
under lock and key, he felt that he might breathe more freely.  No
one was allowed to know the secret of their existence in the house,
except himself and Davenport.  He arranged that Davenport should
take Oolanga round the neighbourhood for a walk, stopping at each of
the places which he designated.  Having gone all along the Brow, he
was to return the same way and induce him to touch on the same
subjects in talking with Adam, who was to meet them as if by chance
at the farthest part--that beyond Mercy Farm.

The incidents of the day proved much as Adam expected.  At Mercy
Farm, at Diana's Grove, at Castra Regis, and a few other spots, the
negro stopped and, opening his wide nostrils as if to sniff boldly,
said that he smelled death.  It was not always in the same form.  At
Mercy Farm he said there were many small deaths.  At Diana's Grove
his bearing was different.  There was a distinct sense of enjoyment
about him, especially when he spoke of many great deaths.  Here,
too, he sniffed in a strange way, like a bloodhound at check, and
looked puzzled.  He said no word in either praise or disparagement,
but in the centre of the Grove, where, hidden amongst ancient oak
stumps, was a block of granite slightly hollowed on the top, he bent
low and placed his forehead on the ground.  This was the only place
where he showed distinct reverence.  At the Castle, though he spoke
of much death, he showed no sign of respect.

There was evidently something about Diana's Grove which both
interested and baffled him.  Before leaving, he moved all over the
place unsatisfied, and in one spot, close to the edge of the Brow,
where there was a deep hollow, he appeared to be afraid.  After
returning several times to this place, he suddenly turned and ran in
a panic of fear to the higher ground, crossing as he did so the
outcropping rock.  Then he seemed to breathe more freely, and
recovered some of his jaunty impudence.

All this seemed to satisfy Adam's expectations.  He went back to
Lesser Hill with a serene and settled calm upon him.  Sir Nathaniel
followed him into his study.

""By the way, I forgot to ask you details about one thing.  When that
extraordinary staring episode of Mr. Caswall went on, how did Lilla
take it--how did she bear herself?""

""She looked frightened, and trembled just as I have seen a pigeon
with a hawk, or a bird with a serpent.""

""Thanks.  It is just as I expected.  There have been circumstances
in the Caswall family which lead one to believe that they have had
from the earliest times some extraordinary mesmeric or hypnotic
faculty.  Indeed, a skilled eye could read so much in their
physiognomy.  That shot of yours, whether by instinct or intention,
of the hawk and the pigeon was peculiarly apposite.  I think we may
settle on that as a fixed trait to be accepted throughout our
investigation.""

When dusk had fallen, Adam took the new mongoose--not the one from
Nepaul--and, carrying the box slung over his shoulder, strolled
towards Diana's Grove.  Close to the gateway he met Lady Arabella,
clad as usual in tightly fitting white, which showed off her slim
figure.

To his intense astonishment the mongoose allowed her to pet him,
take him up in her arms and fondle him.  As she was going in his
direction, they walked on together.

Round the roadway between the entrances of Diana's Grove and Lesser
Hill were many trees, with not much foliage except at the top.  In
the dusk this place was shadowy, and the view was hampered by the
clustering trunks.  In the uncertain, tremulous light which fell
through the tree-tops, it was hard to distinguish anything clearly,
and at last, somehow, he lost sight of her altogether, and turned
back on his track to find her.  Presently he came across her close
to her own gate.  She was leaning over the paling of split oak
branches which formed the paling of the avenue.  He could not see
the mongoose, so he asked her where it had gone.

""He slipt out of my arms while I was petting him,"" she answered,
""and disappeared under the hedges.""

They found him at a place where the avenue widened so as to let
carriages pass each other.  The little creature seemed quite
changed.  He had been ebulliently active; now he was dull and
spiritless--seemed to be dazed.  He allowed himself to be lifted by
either of the pair; but when he was alone with Lady Arabella he kept
looking round him in a strange way, as though trying to escape.
When they had come out on the roadway Adam held the mongoose tight
to him, and, lifting his hat to his companion, moved quickly towards
Lesser Hill; he and Lady Arabella lost sight of each other in the
thickening gloom.

When Adam got home, he put the mongoose in his box, and locked the
door of the room.  The other mongoose--the one from Nepaul--was
safely locked in his own box, but he lay quiet and did not stir.
When he got to his study Sir Nathaniel came in, shutting the door
behind him.

""I have come,"" he said, ""while we have an opportunity of being
alone, to tell you something of the Caswall family which I think
will interest you.  There is, or used to be, a belief in this part
of the world that the Caswall family had some strange power of
making the wills of other persons subservient to their own.  There
are many allusions to the subject in memoirs and other unimportant
works, but I only know of one where the subject is spoken of
definitely.  It is MERCIA AND ITS WORTHIES, written by Ezra Toms
more than a hundred years ago.  The author goes into the question of
the close association of the then Edgar Caswall with Mesmer in
Paris.  He speaks of Caswall being a pupil and the fellow worker of
Mesmer, and states that though, when the latter left France, he took
away with him a vast quantity of philosophical and electric
instruments, he was never known to use them again.  He once made it
known to a friend that he had given them to his old pupil.  The term
he used was odd, for it was 'bequeathed,' but no such bequest of
Mesmer was ever made known.  At any rate the instruments were
missing, and never turned up.""

A servant came into the room to tell Adam that there was some
strange noise coming from the locked room into which he had gone
when he came in.  He hurried off to the place at once, Sir Nathaniel
going with him.  Having locked the door behind them, Adam opened the
packing-case where the boxes of the two mongooses were locked up.
There was no sound from one of them, but from the other a queer
restless struggling.  Having opened both boxes, he found that the
noise was from the Nepaul animal, which, however, became quiet at
once.  In the other box the new mongoose lay dead, with every
appearance of having been strangled!



CHAPTER X--THE KITE



On the following day, a little after four o'clock, Adam set out for
Mercy.

He was home just as the clocks were striking six.  He was pale and
upset, but otherwise looked strong and alert.  The old man summed up
his appearance and manner thus:  ""Braced up for battle.""

""Now!"" said Sir Nathaniel, and settled down to listen, looking at
Adam steadily and listening attentively that he might miss nothing--
even the inflection of a word.

""I found Lilla and Mimi at home.  Watford had been detained by
business on the farm.  Miss Watford received me as kindly as before;
Mimi, too, seemed glad to see me.  Mr. Caswall came so soon after I
arrived, that he, or someone on his behalf, must have been watching
for me.  He was followed closely by the negro, who was puffing hard
as if he had been running--so it was probably he who watched.  Mr.
Caswall was very cool and collected, but there was a more than
usually iron look about his face that I did not like.  However, we
got on very well.  He talked pleasantly on all sorts of questions.
The nigger waited a while and then disappeared as on the other
occasion.  Mr. Caswall's eyes were as usual fixed on Lilla.  True,
they seemed to be very deep and earnest, but there was no offence in
them.  Had it not been for the drawing down of the brows and the
stern set of the jaws, I should not at first have noticed anything.
But the stare, when presently it began, increased in intensity.  I
could see that Lilla began to suffer from nervousness, as on the
first occasion; but she carried herself bravely.  However, the more
nervous she grew, the harder Mr. Caswall stared.  It was evident to
me that he had come prepared for some sort of mesmeric or hypnotic
battle.  After a while he began to throw glances round him and then
raised his hand, without letting either Lilla or Mimi see the
action.  It was evidently intended to give some sign to the negro,
for he came, in his usual stealthy way, quietly in by the hall door,
which was open.  Then Mr. Caswall's efforts at staring became
intensified, and poor Lilla's nervousness grew greater.  Mimi,
seeing that her cousin was distressed, came close to her, as if to
comfort or strengthen her with the consciousness of her presence.
This evidently made a difficulty for Mr. Caswall, for his efforts,
without appearing to get feebler, seemed less effective.  This
continued for a little while, to the gain of both Lilla and Mimi.
Then there was a diversion.  Without word or apology the door
opened, and Lady Arabella March entered the room.  I had seen her
coming through the great window.  Without a word she crossed the
room and stood beside Mr. Caswall.  It really was very like a fight
of a peculiar kind; and the longer it was sustained the more
earnest--the fiercer--it grew.  That combination of forces--the
over-lord, the white woman, and the black man--would have cost some-
-probably all of them--their lives in tthee Southern States of
America.  To us it was simply horrible.  But all that you can
understand.  This time, to go on in sporting phrase, it was
understood by all to be a 'fight to a finish,' and the mixed group
did not slacken a moment or relax their efforts.  On Lilla the
strain began to tell disastrously.  She grew pale--a patchy pallor,
which meant that her nerves were out of order.  She trembled like an
aspen, and though she struggled bravely, I noticed that her legs
would hardly support her.  A dozen times she seemed about to
collapse in a faint, but each time, on catching sight of Mimi's
eyes, she made a fresh struggle and pulled through.

""By now Mr. Caswall's face had lost its appearance of passivity.
His eyes glowed with a fiery light.  He was still the old Roman in
inflexibility of purpose; but grafted on to the Roman was a new
Berserker fury.  His companions in the baleful work seemed to have
taken on something of his feeling.  Lady Arabella looked like a
soulless, pitiless being, not human, unless it revived old legends
of transformed human beings who had lost their humanity in some
transformation or in the sweep of natural savagery.  As for the
negro--well, I can only say that it was solely due to the self-
restraint which you impressed on me that I did not wipe him out as
he stood--without warning, without fair play--without a single one
of the graces of life and death.  Lilla was silent in the helpless
concentration of deadly fear; Mimi was all resolve and self-
forgetfulness, so intent on the soul-struggle in which she was
engaged that there was no possibility of any other thought.  As for
myself, the bonds of will which held me inactive seemed like bands
of steel which numbed all my faculties, except sight and hearing.
We seemed fixed in an IMPASSE.  Something must happen, though the
power of guessing was inactive.  As in a dream, I saw Mimi's hand
move restlessly, as if groping for something.  Mechanically it
touched that of Lilla, and in that instant she was transformed.  It
was as if youth and strength entered afresh into something already
dead to sensibility and intention.  As if by inspiration, she
grasped the other's band with a force which blenched the knuckles.
Her face suddenly flamed, as if some divine light shone through it.
Her form expanded till it stood out majestically.  Lifting her right
hand, she stepped forward towards Caswall, and with a bold sweep of
her arm seemed to drive some strange force towards him.  Again and
again was the gesture repeated, the man falling back from her at
each movement.  Towards the door he retreated, she following.  There
was a sound as of the cooing sob of doves, which seemed to multiply
and intensify with each second.  The sound from the unseen source
rose and rose as he retreated, till finally it swelled out in a
triumphant peal, as she with a fierce sweep of her arm, seemed to
hurl something at her foe, and he, moving his hands blindly before
his face, appeared to be swept through the doorway and out into the
open sunlight.

""All at once my own faculties were fully restored; I could see and
hear everything, and be fully conscious of what was going on.  Even
the figures of the baleful group were there, though dimly seen as
through a veil--a shadowy veil.  I saw Lilla sink down in a swoon,
and Mimi throw up her arms in a gesture of triumph.  As I saw her
through the great window, the sunshine flooded the landscape, which,
however, was momentarily becoming eclipsed by an onrush of a myriad
birds.""

By the next morning, daylight showed the actual danger which
threatened.  From every part of the eastern counties reports were
received concerning the enormous immigration of birds.  Experts were
sending--on their own account, on behalf of learned societies, and
through local and imperial governing bodies--reports dealing with
the matter, and suggesting remedies.

The reports closer to home were even more disturbing.  All day long
it would seem that the birds were coming thicker from all quarters.
Doubtless many were going as well as coming, but the mass seemed
never to get less.  Each bird seemed to sound some note of fear or
anger or seeking, and the whirring of wings never ceased nor
lessened.  The air was full of a muttered throb.  No window or
barrier could shut out the sound, till the ears of any listener
became dulled by the ceaseless murmur.  So monotonous it was, so
cheerless, so disheartening, so melancholy, that all longed, but in
vain, for any variety, no matter how terrible it might be.

The second morning the reports from all the districts round were
more alarming than ever.  Farmers began to dread the coming of
winter as they saw the dwindling of the timely fruitfulness of the
earth.  And as yet it was only a warning of evil, not the evil
accomplished; the ground began to look bare whenever some passing
sound temporarily frightened the birds.

Edgar Caswall tortured his brain for a long time unavailingly, to
think of some means of getting rid of what he, as well as his
neighbours, had come to regard as a plague of birds.  At last he
recalled a circumstance which promised a solution of the difficulty.
The experience was of some years ago in China, far up-country,
towards the head-waters of the Yang-tze-kiang, where the smaller
tributaries spread out in a sort of natural irrigation scheme to
supply the wilderness of paddy-fields.  It was at the time of the
ripening rice, and the myriads of birds which came to feed on the
coming crop was a serious menace, not only to the district, but to
the country at large.  The farmers, who were more or less afflicted
with the same trouble every season, knew how to deal with it.  They
made a vast kite, which they caused to be flown over the centre spot
of the incursion.  The kite was shaped like a great hawk; and the
moment it rose into the air the birds began to cower and seek
protection--and then to disappear.  So long as that kite was flying
overhead the birds lay low and the crop was saved.  Accordingly
Caswall ordered his men to construct an immense kite, adhering as
well as they could to the lines of a hawk.  Then he and his men,
with a sufficiency of cord, began to fly it high overhead.  The
experience of China was repeated.  The moment the kite rose, the
birds hid or sought shelter.  The following morning, the kite was
still flying high, no bird was to be seen as far as the eye could
reach from Castra Regis.  But there followed in turn what proved
even a worse evil.  All the birds were cowed; their sounds stopped.
Neither song nor chirp was heard--silence seemed to have taken the
place of the normal voices of bird life.  But that was not all.  The
silence spread to all animals.

The fear and restraint which brooded amongst the denizens of the air
began to affect all life.  Not only did the birds cease song or
chirp, but the lowing of the cattle ceased in the fields and the
varied sounds of life died away.  In place of these things was only
a soundless gloom, more dreadful, more disheartening, more soul-
killing than any concourse of sounds, no matter how full of fear and
dread.  Pious individuals put up constant prayers for relief from
the intolerable solitude.  After a little there were signs of
universal depression which those who ran might read.  One and all,
the faces of men and women seemed bereft of vitality, of interest,
of thought, and, most of all, of hope.  Men seemed to have lost the
power of expression of their thoughts.  The soundless air seemed to
have the same effect as the universal darkness when men gnawed their
tongues with pain.

From this infliction of silence there was no relief.  Everything was
affected; gloom was the predominant note.  Joy appeared to have
passed away as a factor of life, and this creative impulse had
nothing to take its place.  That giant spot in high air was a plague
of evil influence.  It seemed like a new misanthropic belief which
had fallen on human beings, carrying with it the negation of all
hope.

After a few days, men began to grow desperate; their very words as
well as their senses seemed to be in chains.  Edgar Caswall again
tortured his brain to find any antidote or palliative of this
greater evil than before.  He would gladly have destroyed the kite,
or caused its flying to cease; but the instant it was pulled down,
the birds rose up in even greater numbers; all those who depended in
any way on agriculture sent pitiful protests to Castra Regis.

It was strange indeed what influence that weird kite seemed to
exercise.  Even human beings were affected by it, as if both it and
they were realities.  As for the people at Mercy Farm, it was like a
taste of actual death.  Lilla felt it most.  If she had been indeed
a real dove, with a real kite hanging over her in the air, she could
not have been more frightened or more affected by the terror this
created.

Of course, some of those already drawn into the vortex noticed the
effect on individuals.  Those who were interested took care to
compare their information.  Strangely enough, as it seemed to the
others, the person who took the ghastly silence least to heart was
the negro.  By nature he was not sensitive to, or afflicted by,
nerves.  This alone would not have produced the seeming
indifference, so they set their minds to discover the real cause.
Adam came quickly to the conclusion that there was for him some
compensation that the others did not share; and he soon believed
that that compensation was in one form or another the enjoyment of
the sufferings of others.  Thus the black had a never-failing source
of amusement.

Lady Arabella's cold nature rendered her immune to anything in the
way of pain or trouble concerning others.  Edgar Caswall was far too
haughty a person, and too stern of nature, to concern himself about
poor or helpless people, much less the lower order of mere animals.
Mr. Watford, Mr. Salton, and Sir Nathaniel were all concerned in the
issue, partly from kindness of heart--for none of them could see
suffering, even of wild birds, unmoved--and partly on account of
their property, which had to be protected, or ruin would stare them
in the face before long.

Lilla suffered acutely.  As time went on, her face became pinched,
and her eyes dull with watching and crying.  Mimi suffered too on
account of her cousin's suffering.  But as she could do nothing, she
resolutely made up her mind to self-restraint and patience.  Adam's
frequent visits comforted her.



CHAPTER XI--MESMER'S CHEST



After a couple of weeks had passed, the kite seemed to give Edgar
Caswall a new zest for life.  He was never tired of looking at its
movements.  He had a comfortable armchair put out on the tower,
wherein he sat sometimes all day long, watching as though the kite
was a new toy and he a child lately come into possession of it.  He
did not seem to have lost interest in Lilla, for he still paid an
occasional visit at Mercy Farm.

Indeed, his feeling towards her, whatever it had been at first, had
now so far changed that it had become a distinct affection of a
purely animal kind.  Indeed, it seemed as though the man's nature
had become corrupted, and that all the baser and more selfish and
more reckless qualities had become more conspicuous.  There was not
so much sternness apparent in his nature, because there was less
self-restraint.  Determination had become indifference.

The visible change in Edgar was that he grew morbid, sad, silent;
the neighbours thought he was going mad.  He became absorbed in the
kite, and watched it not only by day, but often all night long.  It
became an obsession to him.

Caswall took a personal interest in the keeping of the great kite
flying.  He had a vast coil of cord efficient for the purpose, which
worked on a roller fixed on the parapet of the tower.  There was a
winch for the pulling in of the slack; the outgoing line being
controlled by a racket.  There was invariably one man at least, day
and night, on the tower to attend to it.  At such an elevation there
was always a strong wind, and at times the kite rose to an enormous
height, as well as travelling for great distances laterally.  In
fact, the kite became, in a short time, one of the curiosities of
Castra Regis and all around it.  Edgar began to attribute to it, in
his own mind, almost human qualities.  It became to him a separate
entity, with a mind and a soul of its own.  Being idle-handed all
day, he began to apply to what he considered the service of the kite
some of his spare time, and found a new pleasure--a new object in
life--in the old schoolboy game of sending up ""runners"" to the kite.
The way this is done is to get round pieces of paper so cut that
there is a hole in the centre, through which the string of the kite
passes.  The natural action of the wind-pressure takes the paper
along the string, and so up to the kite itself, no matter how high
or how far it may have gone.

In the early days of this amusement Edgar Caswall spent hours.
Hundreds of such messengers flew along the string, until soon he
bethought him of writing messages on these papers so that he could
make known his ideas to the kite.  It may be that his brain gave way
under the opportunities given by his illusion of the entity of the
toy and its power of separate thought.  From sending messages he
came to making direct speech to the kite--without, however, ceasing
to send the runners.  Doubtless, the height of the tower, seated as
it was on the hill-top, the rushing of the ceaseless wind, the
hypnotic effect of the lofty altitude of the speck in the sky at
which he gazed, and the rushing of the paper messengers up the
string till sight of them was lost in distance, all helped to
further affect his brain, undoubtedly giving way under the strain of
beliefs and circumstances which were at once stimulating to the
imagination, occupative of his mind, and absorbing.

The next step of intellectual decline was to bring to bear on the
main idea of the conscious identity of the kite all sorts of
subjects which had imaginative force or tendency of their own.  He
had, in Castra Regis, a large collection of curious and interesting
things formed in the past by his forebears, of similar tastes to his
own.  There were all sorts of strange anthropological specimens,
both old and new, which had been collected through various travels
in strange places:  ancient Egyptian relics from tombs and mummies;
curios from Australia, New Zealand, and the South Seas; idols and
images--from Tartar ikons to ancient Egyptian, Persian, and Indian
objects of worship; objects of death and torture of American
Indians; and, above all, a vast collection of lethal weapons of
every kind and from every place--Chinese ""high pinders,"" double
knives, Afghan double-edged scimitars made to cut a body in two,
heavy knives from all the Eastern countries, ghost daggers from
Thibet, the terrible kukri of the Ghourka and other hill tribes of
India, assassins' weapons from Italy and Spain, even the knife which
was formerly carried by the slave-drivers of the Mississippi region.
Death and pain of every kind were fully represented in that gruesome
collection.

That it had a fascination for Oolanga goes without saying.  He was
never tired of visiting the museum in the tower, and spent endless
hours in inspecting the exhibits, till he was thoroughly familiar
with every detail of all of them.  He asked permission to clean and
polish and sharpen them--a favour which was readily granted.  In
addition to the above objects, there were many things of a kind to
awaken human fear.  Stuffed serpents of the most objectionable and
horrid kind; giant insects from the tropics, fearsome in every
detail; fishes and crustaceans covered with weird spikes; dried
octopuses of great size.  Other things, too, there were, not less
deadly though seemingly innocuous--dried fungi, traps intended for
birds, beasts, fishes, reptiles, and insects; machines which could
produce pain of any kind and degree, and the only mercy of which was
the power of producing speedy death.

Caswall, who had never before seen any of these things, except those
which he had collected himself, found a constant amusement and
interest in them.  He studied them, their uses, their mechanism--
where there was such--and their places of origin, until he had an
ample and real knowledge of all concerning them.  Many were secret
and intricate, but he never rested till he found out all the
secrets.  When once he had become interested in strange objects, and
the way to use them, he began to explore various likely places for
similar finds.  He began to inquire of his household where strange
lumber was kept.  Several of the men spoke of old Simon Chester as
one who knew everything in and about the house.  Accordingly, he
sent for the old man, who came at once.  He was very old, nearly
ninety years of age, and very infirm.  He had been born in the
Castle, and had served its succession of masters--present or absent-
-ever since.  When Edgar began to questtioon him on the subject
regarding which he had sent for him, old Simon exhibited much
perturbation.  In fact, he became so frightened that his master,
fully believing that he was concealing something, ordered him to
tell at once what remained unseen, and where it was hidden away.
Face to face with discovery of his secret, the old man, in a
pitiable state of concern, spoke out even more fully than Mr.
Caswall had expected.

""Indeed, indeed, sir, everything is here in the tower that has ever
been put away in my time except--except--"" here he began to shake
and tremble it--""except the chest which Mr. Edgar--he who was Mr.
Edgar when I first took service--brought back from France, after he
had been with Dr. Mesmer.  The trunk has been kept in my room for
safety; but I shall send it down here now.""

""What is in it?"" asked Edgar sharply.

""That I do not know.  Moreover, it is a peculiar trunk, without any
visible means of opening.""

""Is there no lock?""

""I suppose so, sir; but I do not know.  There is no keyhole.""

""Send it here; and then come to me yourself.""

The trunk, a heavy one with steel bands round it, but no lock or
keyhole, was carried in by two men.  Shortly afterwards old Simon
attended his master.  When he came into the room, Mr. Caswall
himself went and closed the door; then he asked:

""How do you open it?""

""I do not know, sir.""

""Do you mean to say that you never opened it?""

""Most certainly I say so, your honour.  How could I?  It was
entrusted to me with the other things by my master.  To open it
would have been a breach of trust.""

Caswall sneered.

""Quite remarkable!  Leave it with me.  Close the door behind you.
Stay--did no one ever tell you about it--say anything regarding it--
make any remark?""

Old Simon turned pale, and put his trembling hands together.

""Oh, sir, I entreat you not to touch it.  That trunk probably
contains secrets which Dr. Mesmer told my master.  Told them to his
ruin!""

""How do you mean?  What ruin?""

""Sir, he it was who, men said, sold his soul to the Evil One; I had
thought that that time and the evil of it had all passed away.""

""That will do.  Go away; but remain in your own room, or within
call.  I may want you.""

The old man bowed deeply and went out trembling, but without
speaking a word.



CHAPTER XII--THE CHEST OPENED



Left alone in the turret-room, Edgar Caswall carefully locked the
door and hung a handkerchief over the keyhole.  Next, he inspected
the windows, and saw that they were not overlooked from any angle of
the main building.  Then he carefully examined the trunk, going over
it with a magnifying glass.  He found it intact:  the steel bands
were flawless; the whole trunk was compact.  After sitting opposite
to it for some time, and the shades of evening beginning to melt
into darkness, he gave up the task and went to his bedroom, after
locking the door of the turret-room behind him and taking away the
key.

He woke in the morning at daylight, and resumed his patient but
unavailing study of the metal trunk.  This he continued during the
whole day with the same result--humiliating disappointment, which
overwrought his nerves and made his head ache.  The result of the
long strain was seen later in the afternoon, when he sat locked
within the turret-room before the still baffling trunk, distrait,
listless and yet agitated, sunk in a settled gloom.  As the dusk was
falling he told the steward to send him two men, strong ones.  These
he ordered to take the trunk to his bedroom.  In that room he then
sat on into the night, without pausing even to take any food.  His
mind was in a whirl, a fever of excitement.  The result was that
when, late in the night, he locked himself in his room his brain was
full of odd fancies; he was on the high road to mental disturbance.
He lay down on his bed in the dark, still brooding over the mystery
of the closed trunk.

Gradually he yielded to the influences of silence and darkness.
After lying there quietly for some time, his mind became active
again.  But this time there were round him no disturbing influences;
his brain was active and able to work freely and to deal with
memory.  A thousand forgotten--or only half-known--incidents,
fragments of conversations or theories long ago guessed at and long
forgotten, crowded on his mind.  He seemed to hear again around him
the legions of whirring wings to which he had been so lately
accustomed.  Even to himself he knew that that was an effort of
imagination founded on imperfect memory.  But he was content that
imagination should work, for out of it might come some solution of
the mystery which surrounded him.  And in this frame of mind, sleep
made another and more successful essay.  This time he enjoyed
peaceful slumber, restful alike to his wearied body and his
overwrought brain.

In his sleep he arose, and, as if in obedience to some influence
beyond and greater than himself, lifted the great trunk and set it
on a strong table at one side of the room, from which he had
previously removed a quantity of books.  To do this, he had to use
an amount of strength which was, he knew, far beyond him in his
normal state.  As it was, it seemed easy enough; everything yielded
before his touch.  Then he became conscious that somehow--how, he
never could remember--the chest was open.  He unlocked his door,
and, taking the chest on his shoulder, carried it up to the turret-
room, the door of which also he unlocked.  Even at the time he was
amazed at his own strength, and wondered whence it had come.  His
mind, lost in conjecture, was too far off to realise more immediate
things.  He knew that the chest was enormously heavy.  He seemed, in
a sort of vision which lit up the absolute blackness around, to see
the two sturdy servant men staggering under its great weight.  He
locked himself again in the turret-room, and laid the opened chest
on a table, and in the darkness began to unpack it, laying out the
contents, which were mainly of metal and glass--great pieces in
strange forms--on another table.  He was conscious of being still
asleep, and of acting rather in obedience to some unseen and unknown
command than in accordance with any reasonable plan, to be followed
by results which he understood.  This phase completed, he proceeded
to arrange in order the component parts of some large instruments,
formed mostly of glass.  His fingers seemed to have acquired a new
and exquisite subtlety and even a volition of their own.  Then
weariness of brain came upon him; his head sank down on his breast,
and little by little everything became wrapped in gloom.

He awoke in the early morning in his bedroom, and looked around him,
now clear-headed, in amazement.  In its usual place on the strong
table stood the great steel-hooped chest without lock or key.  But
it was now locked.  He arose quietly and stole to the turret-room.
There everything was as it had been on the previous evening.  He
looked out of the window where high in air flew, as usual, the giant
kite.  He unlocked the wicket gate of the turret stair and went out
on the roof.  Close to him was the great coil of cord on its reel.
It was humming in the morning breeze, and when he touched the string
it sent a quick thrill through hand and arm.  There was no sign
anywhere that there had been any disturbance or displacement of
anything during the night.

Utterly bewildered, he sat down in his room to think.  Now for the
first time he FELT that he was asleep and dreaming.  Presently he
fell asleep again, and slept for a long time.  He awoke hungry and
made a hearty meal.  Then towards evening, having locked himself in,
he fell asleep again.  When he woke he was in darkness, and was
quite at sea as to his whereabouts.  He began feeling about the dark
room, and was recalled to the consequences of his position by the
breaking of a large piece of glass.  Having obtained a light, he
discovered this to be a glass wheel, part of an elaborate piece of
mechanism which he must in his sleep have taken from the chest,
which was now opened.  He had once again opened it whilst asleep,
but he had no recollection of the circumstances.

Caswall came to the conclusion that there had been some sort of dual
action of his mind, which might lead to some catastrophe or some
discovery of his secret plans; so he resolved to forgo for a while
the pleasure of making discoveries regarding the chest.  To this
end, he applied himself to quite another matter--an investigation of
the other treasures and rare objects in his collections.  He went
amongst them in simple, idle curiosity, his main object being to
discover some strange item which he might use for experiment with
the kite.  He had already resolved to try some runners other than
those made of paper.  He had a vague idea that with such a force as
the great kite straining at its leash, this might be used to lift to
the altitude of the kite itself heavier articles.  His first
experiment with articles of little but increasing weight was
eminently successful.  So he added by degrees more and more weight,
until he found out that the lifting power of the kite was
considerable.  He then determined to take a step further, and send
to the kite some of the articles which lay in the steel-hooped
chest.  The last time he had opened it in sleep, it had not been
shut again, and he had inserted a wedge so that he could open it at
will.  He made examination of the contents, but came to the
conclusion that the glass objects were unsuitable.  They were too
light for testing weight, and they were so frail as to be dangerous
to send to such a height.

So he looked around for something more solid with which to
experiment.  His eye caught sight of an object which at once
attracted him.  This was a small copy of one of the ancient Egyptian
gods--that of Bes, who represented the destructive power of nature.
It was so bizarre and mysterious as to commend itself to his mad
humour.  In lifting it from the cabinet, he was struck by its great
weight in proportion to its size.  He made accurate examination of
it by the aid of some instruments, and came to the conclusion that
it was carved from a lump of lodestone.  He remembered that he had
read somewhere of an ancient Egyptian god cut from a similar
substance, and, thinking it over, he came to the conclusion that he
must have read it in Sir Thomas Brown's POPULAR ERRORS, a book of
the seventeenth century.  He got the book from the library, and
looked out the passage:

""A great example we have from the observation of our learned friend
Mr. Graves, in an AEgyptian idol cut out of Loadstone and found
among the Mummies; which still retains its attraction, though
probably taken out of the mine about two thousand years ago.""

The strangeness of the figure, and its being so close akin to his
own nature, attracted him.  He made from thin wood a large circular
runner, and in front of it placed the weighty god, sending it up to
the flying kite along the throbbing cord.



CHAPTER XIII--OOLANGA'S HALLUCINATIONS



During the last few days Lady Arabella had been getting exceedingly
impatient.  Her debts, always pressing, were growing to an
embarrassing amount.  The only hope she had of comfort in life was a
good marriage; but the good marriage on which she had fixed her eye
did not seem to move quickly enough--indeed, it did not seem to move
at all--in the right direction.  Edgar Caswall was not an ardent
wooer.  From the very first he seemed DIFFICILE, but he had been
keeping to his own room ever since his struggle with Mimi Watford.
On that occasion Lady Arabella had shown him in an unmistakable way
what her feelings were; indeed, she had made it known to him, in a
more overt way than pride should allow, that she wished to help and
support him.  The moment when she had gone across the room to stand
beside him in his mesmeric struggle, had been the very limit of her
voluntary action.  It was quite bitter enough, she felt, that he did
not come to her, but now that she had made that advance, she felt
that any withdrawal on his part would, to a woman of her class, be
nothing less than a flaming insult.  Had she not classed herself
with his nigger servant, an unreformed savage?  Had she not shown
her preference for him at the festival of his home-coming?  Had she
not. . . Lady Arabella was cold-blooded, and she was prepared to go
through all that might be necessary of indifference, and even
insult, to become chatelaine of Castra Regis.  In the meantime, she
would show no hurry--she must wait.  She might, in an unostentatious
way, come to him again.  She knew him now, and could make a keen
guess at his desires with regard to Lilla Watford.  With that secret
in her possession, she could bring pressure to bear on Caswall which
would make it no easy matter for him to evade her.  The great
difficulty was how to get near him.  He was shut up within his
Castle, and guarded by a defence of convention which she could not
pass without danger of ill repute to herself.  Over this question
she thought and thought for days and nights.  At last she decided
that the only way would be to go to him openly at Castra Regis.  Her
rank and position would make such a thing possible, if carefully
done.  She could explain matters afterwards if necessary.  Then when
they were alone, she would use her arts and her experience to make
him commit himself.  After all, he was only a man, with a man's
dislike of difficult or awkward situations.  She felt quite
sufficient confidence in her own womanhood to carry her through any
difficulty which might arise.

From Diana's Grove she heard each day the luncheon-gong from Castra
Regis sound, and knew the hour when the servants would be in the
back of the house.  She would enter the house at that hour, and,
pretending that she could not make anyone hear her, would seek him
in his own rooms.  The tower was, she knew, away from all the usual
sounds of the house, and moreover she knew that the servants had
strict orders not to interrupt him when he was in the turret
chamber.  She had found out, partly by the aid of an opera-glass and
partly by judicious questioning, that several times lately a heavy
chest had been carried to and from his room, and that it rested in
the room each night.  She was, therefore, confident that he had some
important work on hand which would keep him busy for long spells.

Meanwhile, another member of the household at Castra Regis had
schemes which he thought were working to fruition.  A man in the
position of a servant has plenty of opportunity of watching his
betters and forming opinions regarding them.  Oolanga was in his way
a clever, unscrupulous rogue, and he felt that with things moving
round him in this great household there should be opportunities of
self-advancement.  Being unscrupulous and stealthy--and a savage--he
looked to dishonest means.  He saw plainly enough that Lady Arabella
was making a dead set at his master, and he was watchful of the
slightest sign of anything which might enhance this knowledge.  Like
the other men in the house, he knew of the carrying to and fro of
the great chest, and had got it into his head that the care
exercised in its porterage indicated that it was full of treasure.
He was for ever lurking around the turret-rooms on the chance of
making some useful discovery.  But he was as cautious as he was
stealthy, and took care that no one else watched him.

It was thus that the negro became aware of Lady Arabella's venture
into the house, as she thought, unseen.  He took more care than
ever, since he was watching another, that the positions were not
reversed.  More than ever he kept his eyes and ears open and his
mouth shut.  Seeing Lady Arabella gliding up the stairs towards his
master's room, he took it for granted that she was there for no
good, and doubled his watching intentness and caution.

Oolanga was disappointed, but he dared not exhibit any feeling lest
it should betray that he was hiding.  Therefore he slunk downstairs
again noiselessly, and waited for a more favourable opportunity of
furthering his plans.  It must be borne in mind that he thought that
the heavy trunk was full of valuables, and that he believed that
Lady Arabella had come to try to steal it.  His purpose of using for
his own advantage the combination of these two ideas was seen later
in the day.  Oolanga secretly followed her home.  He was an expert
at this game, and succeeded admirably on this occasion.  He watched
her enter the private gate of Diana's Grove, and then, taking a
roundabout course and keeping out of her sight, he at last overtook
her in a thick part of the Grove where no one could see the meeting.

Lady Arabella was much surprised.  She had not seen the negro for
several days, and had almost forgotten his existence.  Oolanga would
have been startled had he known and been capable of understanding
the real value placed on him, his beauty, his worthiness, by other
persons, and compared it with the value in these matters in which he
held himself.  Doubtless Oolanga had his dreams like other men.  In
such cases he saw himself as a young sun-god, as beautiful as the
eye of dusky or even white womanhood had ever dwelt upon.  He would
have been filled with all noble and captivating qualities--or those
regarded as such in West Africa.  Women would have loved him, and
would have told him so in the overt and fervid manner usual in
affairs of the heart in the shadowy depths of the forest of the Gold
Coast.

Oolanga came close behind Lady Arabella, and in a hushed voice,
suitable to the importance of his task, and in deference to the
respect he had for her and the place, began to unfold the story of
his love.  Lady Arabella was not usually a humorous person, but no
man or woman of the white race could have checked the laughter which
rose spontaneously to her lips.  The circumstances were too
grotesque, the contrast too violent, for subdued mirth.  The man a
debased specimen of one of the most primitive races of the earth,
and of an ugliness which was simply devilish; the woman of high
degree, beautiful, accomplished.  She thought that her first
moment's consideration of the outrage--it was nothing less in her
eyes--had given her the full material for thought.  But every
instant after threw new and varied lights on the affront.  Her
indignation was too great for passion; only irony or satire would
meet the situation.  Her cold, cruel nature helped, and she did not
shrink to subject this ignorant savage to the merciless fire-lash of
her scorn.

Oolanga was dimly conscious that he was being flouted; but his anger
was no less keen because of the measure of his ignorance.  So he
gave way to it, as does a tortured beast.  He ground his great teeth
together, raved, stamped, and swore in barbarous tongues and with
barbarous imagery.  Even Lady Arabella felt that it was well she was
within reach of help, or he might have offered her brutal violence--
even have killed her.

""Am I to understand,"" she said with cold disdain, so much more
effective to wound than hot passion, ""that you are offering me your
love?  Your--love?""

For reply he nodded his head.  The scorn of her voice, in a sort of
baleful hiss, sounded--and felt--like the lash of a whip.

""And you dared! you--a savage--a slave--the basest thing in the
world of vermin!  Take care!  I don't value your worthless life more
than I do that of a rat or a spider.  Don't let me ever see your
hideous face here again, or I shall rid the earth of you.""

As she was speaking, she had taken out her revolver and was pointing
it at him.  In the immediate presence of death his impudence forsook
him, and he made a weak effort to justify himself.  His speech was
short, consisting of single words.  To Lady Arabella it sounded mere
gibberish, but it was in his own dialect, and meant love, marriage,
wife.  From the intonation of the words, she guessed, with her
woman's quick intuition, at their meaning; but she quite failed to
follow, when, becoming more pressing, he continued to urge his suit
in a mixture of the grossest animal passion and ridiculous threats.
He warned her that he knew she had tried to steal his master's
treasure, and that he had caught her in the act.  But if she would
be his, he would share the treasure with her, and they could live in
luxury in the African forests.  But if she refused, he would tell
his master, who would flog and torture her and then give her to the
police, who would kill her.



CHAPTER XIV--BATTLE RENEWED



The consequences of that meeting in the dusk of Diana's Grove were
acute and far-reaching, and not only to the two engaged in it.  From
Oolanga, this might have been expected by anyone who knew the
character of the tropical African savage.  To such, there are two
passions that are inexhaustible and insatiable--vanity and that
which they are pleased to call love.  Oolanga left the Grove with an
absorbing hatred in his heart.  His lust and greed were afire, while
his vanity had been wounded to the core.  Lady Arabella's icy nature
was not so deeply stirred, though she was in a seething passion.
More than ever she was set upon bringing Edgar Caswall to her feet.
The obstacles she had encountered, the insults she had endured, were
only as fuel to the purpose of revenge which consumed her.

As she sought her own rooms in Diana's Grove, she went over the
whole subject again and again, always finding in the face of Lilla
Watford a key to a problem which puzzled her--the problem of a way
to turn Caswall's powers--his very existence--to aid her purpose.

When in her boudoir, she wrote a note, taking so much trouble over
it that she destroyed, and rewrote, till her dainty waste-basket was
half-full of torn sheets of notepaper.  When quite satisfied, she
copied out the last sheet afresh, and then carefully burned all the
spoiled fragments.  She put the copied note in an emblazoned
envelope, and directed it to Edgar Caswall at Castra Regis.  This
she sent off by one of her grooms.  The letter ran:


""DEAR MR. CASWALL,

""I want to have a chat with you on a subject in which I believe you
are interested.  Will you kindly call for me one day after lunch--
say at three or four o'clock, and we can walk a little way together.
Only as far as Mercy Farm, where I want to see Lilla and Mimi
Watford.  We can take a cup of tea at the Farm.  Do not bring your
African servant with you, as I am afraid his face frightens the
girls.  After all, he is not pretty, is he?  I have an idea you will
be pleased with your visit this time.

""Yours sincerely,
""ARABELLA MARCH.""


At half-past three next day, Edgar Caswall called at Diana's Grove.
Lady Arabella met him on the roadway outside the gate.  She wished
to take the servants into her confidence as little as possible.  She
turned when she saw him coming, and walked beside him towards Mercy
Farm, keeping step with him as they walked.  When they got near
Mercy, she turned and looked around her, expecting to see Oolanga or
some sign of him.  He was, however, not visible.  He had received
from his master peremptory orders to keep out of sight--an order for
which the African scored a new offence up against her.  They found
Lilla and Mimi at home and seemingly glad to see them, though both
the girls were surprised at the visit coming so soon after the
other.

The proceedings were a repetition of the battle of souls of the
former visit.  On this occasion, however, Edgar Caswall had only the
presence of Lady Arabella to support him--Oolanga being absent; but
Mimi lacked the support of Adam Salton, which had been of such
effective service before.  This time the struggle for supremacy of
will was longer and more determined.  Caswall felt that if he could
not achieve supremacy he had better give up the idea, so all his
pride was enlisted against Mimi.  When they had been waiting for the
door to be opened, Lady Arabella, believing in a sudden attack, had
said to him in a low voice, which somehow carried conviction:

""This time you should win.  Mimi is, after all, only a woman.  Show
her no mercy.  That is weakness.  Fight her, beat her, trample on
her--kill her if need be.  She stands in your way, and I hate her.
Never take your eyes off her.  Never mind Lilla--she is afraid of
you.  You are already her master.  Mimi will try to make you look at
her cousin.  There lies defeat.  Let nothing take your attention
from Mimi, and you will win.  If she is overcoming you, take my hand
and hold it hard whilst you are looking into her eyes.  If she is
too strong for you, I shall interfere.  I'll make a diversion, and
under cover of it you must retire unbeaten, even if not victorious.
Hush! they are coming.""

The two girls came to the door together.  Strange sounds were coming
up over the Brow from the west.  It was the rustling and crackling
of the dry reeds and rushes from the low lands.  The season had been
an unusually dry one.  Also the strong east wind was helping forward
enormous flocks of birds, most of them pigeons with white cowls.
Not only were their wings whirring, but their cooing was plainly
audible.  From such a multitude of birds the mass of sound,
individually small, assumed the volume of a storm.  Surprised at the
influx of birds, to which they had been strangers so long, they all
looked towards Castra Regis, from whose high tower the great kite
had been flying as usual.  But even as they looked, the cord broke,
and the great kite fell headlong in a series of sweeping dives.  Its
own weight, and the aerial force opposed to it, which caused it to
rise, combined with the strong easterly breeze, had been too much
for the great length of cord holding it.

Somehow, the mishap to the kite gave new hope to Mimi.  It was as
though the side issues had been shorn away, so that the main
struggle was thenceforth on simpler lines.  She had a feeling in her
heart, as though some religious chord had been newly touched.  It
may, of course, have been that with the renewal of the bird voices a
fresh courage, a fresh belief in the good issue of the struggle came
too.  In the misery of silence, from which they had all suffered for
so long, any new train of thought was almost bound to be a boon.  As
the inrush of birds continued, their wings beating against the
crackling rushes, Lady Arabella grew pale, and almost fainted.

""What is that?"" she asked suddenly.

To Mimi, born and bred in Siam, the sound was strangely like an
exaggeration of the sound produced by a snake-charmer.

Edgar Caswall was the first to recover from the interruption of the
falling kite.  After a few minutes he seemed to have quite recovered
his SANG FROID, and was able to use his brains to the end which he
had in view.  Mimi too quickly recovered herself, but from a
different cause.  With her it was a deep religious conviction that
the struggle round her was of the powers of Good and Evil, and that
Good was triumphing.  The very appearance of the snowy birds, with
the cowls of Saint Columba, heightened the impression.  With this
conviction strong upon her, she continued the strange battle with
fresh vigour.  She seemed to tower over Caswall, and he to give back
before her oncoming.  Once again her vigorous passes drove him to
the door.  He was just going out backward when Lady Arabella, who
had been gazing at him with fixed eyes, caught his hand and tried to
stop his movement.  She was, however, unable to do any good, and so,
holding hands, they passed out together.  As they did so, the
strange music which had so alarmed Lady Arabella suddenly stopped.
Instinctively they all looked towards the tower of Castra Regis, and
saw that the workmen had refixed the kite, which had risen again and
was beginning to float out to its former station.

As they were looking, the door opened and Michael Watford came into
the room.  By that time all had recovered their self-possession, and
there was nothing out of the common to attract his attention.  As he
came in, seeing inquiring looks all around him, he said:

""The new influx of birds is only the annual migration of pigeons
from Africa.  I am told that it will soon be over.""

The second victory of Mimi Watford made Edgar Caswall more moody
than ever.  He felt thrown back on himself, and this, added to his
absorbing interest in the hope of a victory of his mesmeric powers,
became a deep and settled purpose of revenge.  The chief object of
his animosity was, of course, Mimi, whose will had overcome his, but
it was obscured in greater or lesser degree by all who had opposed
him.  Lilla was next to Mimi in his hate--Lilla, the harmless,
tender-hearted, sweet-natured girl, whose heart was so full of love
for all things that in it was no room for the passions of ordinary
life--whose nature resembled those doves of St. Columba, whose
colour she wore, whose appearance she reflected.  Adam Salton came
next--after a gap; for against him Caswall had no direct animosity.
He regarded him as an interference, a difficulty to be got rid of or
destroyed.  The young Australian had been so discreet that the most
he had against him was his knowledge of what had been.  Caswall did
not understand him, and to such a nature as his, ignorance was a
cause of alarm, of dread.

Caswall resumed his habit of watching the great kite straining at
its cord, varying his vigils in this way by a further examination of
the mysterious treasures of his house, especially Mesmer's chest.
He sat much on the roof of the tower, brooding over his thwarted
passion.  The vast extent of his possessions, visible to him at that
altitude, might, one would have thought, have restored some of his
complacency.  But the very extent of his ownership, thus perpetually
brought before him, created a fresh sense of grievance.  How was it,
he thought, that with so much at command that others wished for, he
could not achieve the dearest wishes of his heart?

In this state of intellectual and moral depravity, he found a solace
in the renewal of his experiments with the mechanical powers of the
kite.  For a couple of weeks he did not see Lady Arabella, who was
always on the watch for a chance of meeting him; neither did he see
the Watford girls, who studiously kept out of his way.  Adam Salton
simply marked time, keeping ready to deal with anything that might
affect his friends.  He called at the farm and heard from Mimi of
the last battle of wills, but it had only one consequence.  He got
from Ross several more mongooses, including a second king-cobra-
killer, which he generally carried with him in its box whenever he
walked out.

Mr. Caswall's experiments with the kite went on successfully.  Each
day he tried the lifting of greater weight, and it seemed almost as
if the machine had a sentience of its own, which was increasing with
the obstacles placed before it.  All this time the kite hung in the
sky at an enormous height.  The wind was steadily from the north, so
the trend of the kite was to the south.  All day long, runners of
increasing magnitude were sent up.  These were only of paper or thin
cardboard, or leather, or other flexible materials.  The great
height at which the kite hung made a great concave curve in the
string, so that as the runners went up they made a flapping sound.
If one laid a finger on the string, the sound answered to the
flapping of the runner in a sort of hollow intermittent murmur.
Edgar Caswall, who was now wholly obsessed by the kite and all
belonging to it, found a distinct resemblance between that
intermittent rumble and the snake-charming music produced by the
pigeons flying through the dry reeds.

One day he made a discovery in Mesmer's chest which he thought he
would utilise with regard to the runners.  This was a great length
of wire, ""fine as human hair,"" coiled round a finely made wheel,
which ran to a wondrous distance freely, and as lightly.  He tried
this on runners, and found it work admirably.  Whether the runner
was alone, or carried something much more weighty than itself, it
worked equally well.  Also it was strong enough and light enough to
draw back the runner without undue strain.  He tried this a good
many times successfully, but it was now growing dusk and he found
some difficulty in keeping the runner in sight.  So he looked for
something heavy enough to keep it still.  He placed the Egyptian
image of Bes on the fine wire, which crossed the wooden ledge which
protected it.  Then, the darkness growing, he went indoors and
forgot all about it.

He had a strange feeling of uneasiness that night--not
sleeplessness, for he seemed conscious of being asleep.  At daylight
he rose, and as usual looked out for the kite.  He did not see it in
its usual position in the sky, so looked round the points of the
compass.  He was more than astonished when presently he saw the
missing kite struggling as usual against the controlling cord.  But
it had gone to the further side of the tower, and now hung and
strained AGAINST THE WIND to the north.  He thought it so strange
that he determined to investigate the phenomenon, and to say nothing
about it in the meantime.

In his many travels, Edgar Caswall had been accustomed to use the
sextant, and was now an expert in the matter.  By the aid of this
and other instruments, he was able to fix the position of the kite
and the point over which it hung.  He was startled to find that
exactly under it--so far as he could ascertain--was Diana's Grove.
He had an inclination to take Lady Arabella into his confidence in
the matter, but he thought better of it and wisely refrained.  For
some reason which he did not try to explain to himself, he was glad
of his silence, when, on the following morning, he found, on looking
out, that the point over which the kite then hovered was Mercy Farm.
When he had verified this with his instruments, he sat before the
window of the tower, looking out and thinking.  The new locality was
more to his liking than the other; but the why of it puzzled him,
all the same.  He spent the rest of the day in the turret-room,
which he did not leave all day.  It seemed to him that he was now
drawn by forces which he could not control--of which, indeed, he had
no knowledge--in directions which he did not understand, and which
were without his own volition.  In sheer helpless inability to think
the problem out satisfactorily, he called up a servant and told him
to tell Oolanga that he wanted to see him at once in the turret-
room.  The answer came back that the African had not been seen since
the previous evening.

Caswall was now so irritable that even this small thing upset him.
As he was distrait and wanted to talk to somebody, he sent for Simon
Chester, who came at once, breathless with hurrying and upset by the
unexpected summons.  Caswall bade him sit down, and when the old man
was in a less uneasy frame of mind, he again asked him if he had
ever seen what was in Mesmer's chest or heard it spoken about.

Chester admitted that he had once, in the time of ""the then Mr.
Edgar,"" seen the chest open, which, knowing something of its history
and guessing more, so upset him that he had fainted.  When he
recovered, the chest was closed.  From that time the then Mr. Edgar
had never spoken about it again.

When Caswall asked him to describe what he had seen when the chest
was open, he got very agitated, and, despite all his efforts to
remain calm, he suddenly went off into a faint.  Caswall summoned
servants, who applied the usual remedies.  Still the old man did not
recover.  After the lapse of a considerable time, the doctor who had
been summoned made his appearance.  A glance was sufficient for him
to make up his mind.  Still, he knelt down by the old man, and made
a careful examination.  Then he rose to his feet, and in a hushed
voice said:

""I grieve to say, sir, that he has passed away.""



CHAPTER XV--ON THE TRACK



Those who had seen Edgar Caswall familiarly since his arrival, and
had already estimated his cold-blooded nature at something of its
true value, were surprised that he took so to heart the death of old
Chester.  The fact was that not one of them had guessed correctly at
his character.  They thought, naturally enough, that the concern
which he felt was that of a master for a faithful old servant of his
family.  They little thought that it was merely the selfish
expression of his disappointment, that he had thus lost the only
remaining clue to an interesting piece of family history--one which
was now and would be for ever wrapped in mystery.  Caswall knew
enough about the life of his ancestor in Paris to wish to know more
fully and more thoroughly all that had been.  The period covered by
that ancestor's life in Paris was one inviting every form of
curiosity.

Lady Arabella, who had her own game to play, saw in the METIER of
sympathetic friend, a series of meetings with the man she wanted to
secure.  She made the first use of the opportunity the day after old
Chester's death; indeed, as soon as the news had filtered in through
the back door of Diana's Grove.  At that meeting, she played her
part so well that even Caswall's cold nature was impressed.

Oolanga was the only one who did not credit her with at least some
sense of fine feeling in the matter.  In emotional, as in other
matters, Oolanga was distinctly a utilitarian, and as he could not
understand anyone feeling grief except for his own suffering, pain,
or for the loss of money, he could not understand anyone simulating
such an emotion except for show intended to deceive.  He thought
that she had come to Castra Regis again for the opportunity of
stealing something, and was determined that on this occasion the
chance of pressing his advantage over her should not pass.  He felt,
therefore, that the occasion was one for extra carefulness in the
watching of all that went on.  Ever since he had come to the
conclusion that Lady Arabella was trying to steal the treasure-
chest, he suspected nearly everyone of the same design, and made it
a point to watch all suspicious persons and places.  As Adam was
engaged on his own researches regarding Lady Arabella, it was only
natural that there should be some crossing of each other's tracks.
This is what did actually happen.

Adam had gone for an early morning survey of the place in which he
was interested, taking with him the mongoose in its box.  He arrived
at the gate of Diana's Grove just as Lady Arabella was preparing to
set out for Castra Regis on what she considered her mission of
comfort.  Seeing Adam from her window going through the shadows of
the trees round the gate, she thought that he must be engaged on
some purpose similar to her own.  So, quickly making her toilet, she
quietly left the house, and, taking advantage of every shadow and
substance which could hide her, followed him on his walk.

Oolanga, the experienced tracker, followed her, but succeeded in
hiding his movements better than she did.  He saw that Adam had on
his shoulder a mysterious box, which he took to contain something
valuable.  Seeing that Lady Arabella was secretly following Adam, he
was confirmed in this idea.  His mind--such as it was--was fixed on
her trying to steal, and he credited her at once with making use of
this new opportunity.

In his walk, Adam went into the grounds of Castra Regis, and Oolanga
saw her follow him with great secrecy.  He feared to go closer, as
now on both sides of him were enemies who might make discovery.
When he realised that Lady Arabella was bound for the Castle, he
devoted himself to following her with singleness of purpose.  He
therefore missed seeing that Adam branched off the track and
returned to the high road.

That night Edgar Caswall had slept badly.  The tragic occurrence of
the day was on his mind, and he kept waking and thinking of it.
After an early breakfast, he sat at the open window watching the
kite and thinking of many things.  From his room he could see all
round the neighbourhood, but the two places that interested him most
were Mercy Farm and Diana's Grove.  At first the movements about
those spots were of a humble kind--those that belong to domestic
service or agricultural needs--the opening of doors and windows, the
sweeping and brushing, and generally the restoration of habitual
order.

From his high window--whose height made it a screen from the
observation of others--he saw the chain of watchers move into his
own grounds, and then presently break up--Adam Salton going one way,
and Lady Arabella, followed by the nigger, another.  Then Oolanga
disappeared amongst the trees; but Caswall could see that he was
still watching.  Lady Arabella, after looking around her, slipped in
by the open door, and he could, of course, see her no longer.

Presently, however, he heard a light tap at his door, then the door
opened slowly, and he could see the flash of Lady Arabella's white
dress through the opening.



CHAPTER XVI--A VISIT OF SYMPATHY



Caswall was genuinely surprised when he saw Lady Arabella, though he
need not have been, after what had already occurred in the same way.
The look of surprise on his face was so much greater than Lady
Arabella had expected--though she thought she was prepared to meet
anything that might occur--that she stood still, in sheer amazement.
Cold-blooded as she was and ready for all social emergencies, she
was nonplussed how to go on.  She was plucky, however, and began to
speak at once, although she had not the slightest idea what she was
going to say.

""I came to offer you my very warm sympathy with the grief you have
so lately experienced.""

""My grief?  I'm afraid I must be very dull; but I really do not
understand.""

Already she felt at a disadvantage, and hesitated.

""I mean about the old man who died so suddenly--your old. . .
retainer.""

Caswall's face relaxed something of its puzzled concentration.

""Oh, he was only a servant; and he had over-stayed his three-score
and ten years by something like twenty years.  He must have been
ninety!""

""Still, as an old servant. . . ""

Caswall's words were not so cold as their inflection.

""I never interfere with servants.  He was kept on here merely
because he had been so long on the premises.  I suppose the steward
thought it might make him unpopular if the old fellow had been
dismissed.""

How on earth was she to proceed on such a task as hers if this was
the utmost geniality she could expect?  So she at once tried another
tack--this time a personal one.

""I am sorry I disturbed you.  I am really not unconventional--though
certainly no slave to convention.  Still there are limits. . . it is
bad enough to intrude in this way, and I do not know what you can
say or think of the time selected, for the intrusion.""

After all, Edgar Caswall was a gentleman by custom and habit, so he
rose to the occasion.

""I can only say, Lady Arabella, that you are always welcome at any
time you may deign to honour my house with your presence.""

She smiled at him sweetly.

""Thank you SO much.  You DO put one at ease.  My breach of
convention makes me glad rather than sorry.  I feel that I can open
my heart to you about anything.""

Forthwith she proceeded to tell him about Oolanga and his strange
suspicions of her honesty.  Caswall laughed and made her explain all
the details.  His final comment was enlightening.

""Let me give you a word of advice:  If you have the slightest fault
to find with that infernal nigger, shoot him at sight.  A swelled-
headed nigger, with a bee in his bonnet, is one of the worst
difficulties in the world to deal with.  So better make a clean job
of it, and wipe him out at once!""

""But what about the law, Mr. Caswall?""

""Oh, the law doesn't concern itself much about dead niggers.  A few
more or less do not matter.  To my mind it's rather a relief!""

""I'm afraid of you,"" was her only comment, made with a sweet smile
and in a soft voice.

""All right,"" he said, ""let us leave it at that.  Anyhow, we shall be
rid of one of them!""

""I don't love niggers any more than you do,"" she replied, ""and I
suppose one mustn't be too particular where that sort of cleaning up
is concerned.""  Then she changed in voice and manner, and asked
genially:  ""And now tell me, am I forgiven?""

""You are, dear lady--if there is anything to forgive.""

As he spoke, seeing that she had moved to go, he came to the door
with her, and in the most natural way accompanied her downstairs.
He passed through the hall with her and down the avenue.  As he went
back to the house, she smiled to herself.

""Well, that is all right.  I don't think the morning has been
altogether thrown away.""

And she walked slowly back to Diana's Grove.

Adam Salton followed the line of the Brow, and refreshed his memory
as to the various localities.  He got home to Lesser Hill just as
Sir Nathaniel was beginning lunch.  Mr. Salton had gone to Walsall
to keep an early appointment; so he was all alone.  When the meal
was over--seeing in Adam's face that he had something to speak
about--he followed into the study and shut the door.

When the two men had lighted their pipes, Sir Nathaniel began.

""I have remembered an interesting fact about Diana's Grove--there
is, I have long understood, some strange mystery about that house.
It may be of some interest, or it may be trivial, in such a tangled
skein as we are trying to unravel.""

""Please tell me all you know' or suspect.  To begin, then, of what
sort is the mystery--physical, mental, moral, historical,
scientific, occult?  Any kind of hint will help me.""

""Quite right.  I shall try to tell you what I think; but I have not
put my thoughts on the subject in sequence, so you must forgive me
if due order is not observed in my narration.  I suppose you have
seen the house at Diana's Grove?""

""The outside of it; but I have that in my mind's eye, and I can fit
into my memory whatever you may mention.""

""The house is very old--probably the first house of some sort that
stood there was in the time of the Romans.  This was probably
renewed--perhaps several times at later periods.  The house stands,
or, rather, used to stand here when Mercia was a kingdom--I do not
suppose that the basement can be later than the Norman Conquest.
Some years ago, when I was President of the Mercian Archaeological
Society, I went all over it very carefully.  This was when it was
purchased by Captain March.  The house had then been done up, so as
to be suitable for the bride.  The basement is very strong,--almost
as strong and as heavy as if it had been intended as a fortress.
There are a whole series of rooms deep underground.  One of them in
particular struck me.  The room itself is of considerable size, but
the masonry is more than massive.  In the middle of the room is a
sunk well, built up to floor level and evidently going deep
underground.  There is no windlass nor any trace of there ever
having been any--no rope--nothing.  Now, we know that the Romans had
wells of immense depth, from which the water was lifted by the 'old
rag rope'; that at Woodhull used to be nearly a thousand feet.
Here, then, we have simply an enormously deep well-hole.  The door
of the room was massive, and was fastened with a lock nearly a foot
square.  It was evidently intended for some kind of protection to
someone or something; but no one in those days had ever heard of
anyone having been allowed even to see the room.  All this is E
PROPOS of a suggestion on my part that the well-hole was a way by
which the White Worm (whatever it was) went and came.  At that time
I would have had a search made--even excavation if necessary--at my
own expense, but all suggestions were met with a prompt and explicit
negative.  So, of course, I took no further step in the matter.
Then it died out of recollection--even of mine.""

""Do you remember, sir,"" asked Adam, ""what was the appearance of the
room where the well-hole was?  Was there furniture--in fact, any
sort of thing in the room?""

""The only thing I remember was a sort of green light--very clouded,
very dim--which came up from the well.  Not a fixed light, but
intermittent and irregular--quite unlike anything I had ever seen.""

""Do you remember how you got into the well-room?  Was there a
separate door from outside, or was there any interior room or
passage which opened into it?""

""I think there must have been some room with a way into it.  I
remember going up some steep steps; they must have been worn smooth
by long use or something of the kind, for I could hardly keep my
feet as I went up.  Once I stumbled and nearly fell into the well-
hole.""

""Was there anything strange about the place--any queer smell, for
instance?""

""Queer smell--yes!  Like bilge or a rank swamp.  It was distinctly
nauseating; when I came out I felt as if I had just been going to be
sick.  I shall try back on my visit and see if I can recall any more
of what I saw or felt.""

""Then perhaps, sir, later in the day you will tell me anything you
may chance to recollect.""

""I shall be delighted, Adam.  If your uncle has not returned by
then, I'll join you in the study after dinner, and we can resume
this interesting chat.""



CHAPTER XVII--THE MYSTERY OF ""THE GROVE""



That afternoon Adam decided to do a little exploring.  As he passed
through the wood outside the gate of Diana's Grove, he thought he
saw the African's face for an instant.  So he went deeper into the
undergrowth, and followed along parallel to the avenue to the house.
He was glad that there was no workman or servant about, for he did
not care that any of Lady Arabella's people should find him
wandering about her grounds.  Taking advantage of the denseness of
the trees, he came close to the house and skirted round it.  He was
repaid for his trouble, for on the far side of the house, close to
where the rocky frontage of the cliff fell away, he saw Oolanga
crouched behind the irregular trunk of a great oak.  The man was so
intent on watching someone, or something, that he did not guard
against being himself watched.  This suited Adam, for he could thus
make scrutiny at will.

The thick wood, though the trees were mostly of small girth, threw a
heavy shadow, so that the steep declension, in front of which grew
the tree behind which the African lurked, was almost in darkness.
Adam drew as close as he could, and was amazed to see a patch of
light on the ground before him; when he realised what it was, he was
determined, more than ever to follow on his quest.  The nigger had a
dark lantern in his hand, and was throwing the light down the steep
incline.  The glare showed a series of stone steps, which ended in a
low-lying heavy iron door fixed against the side of the house.  All
the strange things he had heard from Sir Nathaniel, and all those,
little and big, which he had himself noticed, crowded into his mind
in a chaotic way.  Instinctively he took refuge behind a thick oak
stem, and set himself down, to watch what might occur.

After a short time it became apparent that the African was trying to
find out what was behind the heavy door.  There was no way of
looking in, for the door fitted tight into the massive stone slabs.
The only opportunity for the entrance of light was through a small
hole between the great stones above the door.  This hole was too
high up to look through from the ground level.  Oolanga, having
tried standing tiptoe on the highest point near, and holding the
lantern as high as he could, threw the light round the edges of the
door to see if he could find anywhere a hole or a flaw in the metal
through which he could obtain a glimpse.  Foiled in this, he brought
from the shrubbery a plank, which he leant against the top of the
door and then climbed up with great dexterity.  This did not bring
him near enough to the window-hole to look in, or even to throw the
light of the lantern through it, so he climbed down and carried the
plank back to the place from which he had got it.  Then he concealed
himself near the iron door and waited, manifestly with the intent of
remaining there till someone came near.  Presently Lady Arabella,
moving noiselessly through the shade, approached the door.  When he
saw her close enough to touch it, Oolanga stepped forward from his
concealment, and spoke in a whisper, which through the gloom sounded
like a hiss.

""I want to see you, missy--soon and secret.""

""What do you want?""

""You know well, missy; I told you already.""

She turned on him with blazing eyes, the green tint in them glowing
like emeralds.

""Come, none of that.  If there is anything sensible which you wish
to say to me, you can see me here, just where we are, at seven
o'clock.""

He made no reply in words, but, putting the backs of his hands
together, bent lower and lower till his forehead touched the earth.
Then he rose and went slowly away.

Adam Salton, from his hiding-place, saw and wondered.  In a few
minutes he moved from his place and went home to Lesser Hill, fully
determined that seven o'clock would find him in some hidden place
behind Diana's Grove.

At a little before seven Adam stole softly out of the house and took
the back-way to the rear of Diana's Grove.  The place seemed silent
and deserted, so he took the opportunity of concealing himself near
the spot whence he had seen Oolanga trying to investigate whatever
was concealed behind the iron door.  He waited, perfectly still, and
at last saw a gleam of white passing soundlessly through the
undergrowth.  He was not surprised when he recognised the colour of
Lady Arabella's dress.  She came close and waited, with her face to
the iron door.  From some place of concealment near at hand Oolanga
appeared, and came close to her.  Adam noticed, with surprised
amusement, that over his shoulder was the box with the mongoose.  Of
course the African did not know that he was seen by anyone, least of
all by the man whose property he had with him.

Silent-footed as he was, Lady Arabella heard him coming, and turned
to meet him.  It was somewhat hard to see in the gloom, for, as
usual, he was all in black, only his collar and cuffs showing white.
Lady Arabella opened the conversation which ensued between the two.

""What do you want?  To rob me, or murder me?""

""No, to lub you!""

This frightened her a little, and she tried to change the tone.

""Is that a coffin you have with you?  If so, you are wasting your
time.  It would not hold me.""

When a nigger suspects he is being laughed at, all the ferocity of
his nature comes to the front; and this man was of the lowest kind.

""Dis ain't no coffin for nobody.  Dis box is for you.  Somefin you
lub.  Me give him to you!""

Still anxious to keep off the subject of affection, on which she
believed him to have become crazed, she made another effort to keep
his mind elsewhere.

""Is this why you want to see me?""  He nodded.  ""Then come round to
the other door.  But be quiet.  I have no desire to be seen so close
to my own house in conversation with a--a--a nigger like you!""

She had chosen the word deliberately.  She wished to meet his
passion with another kind.  Such would, at all events, help to keep
him quiet.  In the deep gloom she could not see the anger which
suffused his face.  Rolling eyeballs and grinding teeth are,
however, sufficient signs of anger to be decipherable in the dark.
She moved round the corner of the house to her right.  Oolanga was
following her, when she stopped him by raising her hand.

""No, not that door,"" she said; ""that is not for niggers.  The other
door will do well enough for you!""

Lady Arabella took in her hand a small key which hung at the end of
her watch-chain, and moved to a small door, low down, round the
corner, and a little downhill from the edge of the Brow.  Oolanga,
in obedience to her gesture, went back to the iron door.  Adam
looked carefully at the mongoose box as the African went by, and was
glad to see that it was intact.  Unconsciously, as he looked, he
fingered the key that was in his waistcoat pocket.  When Oolanga was
out of sight, Adam hurried after Lady Arabella.



CHAPTER XVIII--EXIT OOLANGA



The woman turned sharply as Adam touched her shoulder.

""One moment whilst we are alone.  You had better not trust that
nigger!"" he whispered.

Her answer was crisp and concise:

""I don't.""

""Forewarned is forearmed.  Tell me if you will--it is for your own
protection.  Why do you mistrust him?""

""My friend, you have no idea of that man's impudence.  Would you
believe that he wants me to marry him?""

""No!"" said Adam incredulously, amused in spite of himself.

""Yes, and wanted to bribe me to do it by sharing a chest of
treasure--at least, he thought it was--stolen from Mr. Caswall.  Why
do you distrust him, Mr. Salton?""

""Did you notice that box he had slung on his shoulder?  That belongs
to me.  I left it in the gun-room when I went to lunch.  He must
have crept in and stolen it.  Doubtless he thinks that it, too, is
full of treasure.""

""He does!""

""How on earth do you know?"" asked Adam.

""A little while ago he offered to give it to me--another bribe to
accept him.  Faugh!  I am ashamed to tell you such a thing.  The
beast!""

Whilst they had been speaking, she had opened the door, a narrow
iron one, well hung, for it opened easily and closed tightly without
any creaking or sound of any kind.  Within all was dark; but she
entered as freely and with as little misgiving or restraint as if it
had been broad daylight.  For Adam, there was just sufficient green
light from somewhere for him to see that there was a broad flight of
heavy stone steps leading upward; but Lady Arabella, after shutting
the door behind her, when it closed tightly without a clang, tripped
up the steps lightly and swiftly.  For an instant all was dark, but
there came again the faint green light which enabled him to see the
outlines of things.  Another iron door, narrow like the first and
fairly high, led into another large room, the walls of which were of
massive stones, so closely joined together as to exhibit only one
smooth surface.  This presented the appearance of having at one time
been polished.  On the far side, also smooth like the walls, was the
reverse of a wide, but not high, iron door.  Here there was a little
more light, for the high-up aperture over the door opened to the
air.

Lady Arabella took from her girdle another small key, which she
inserted in a keyhole in the centre of a massive lock.  The great
bolt seemed wonderfully hung, for the moment the small key was
turned, the bolts of the great lock moved noiselessly and the iron
doors swung open.  On the stone steps outside stood Oolanga, with
the mongoose box slung over his shoulder.  Lady Arabella stood a
little on one side, and the African, accepting the movement as an
invitation, entered in an obsequious way.  The moment, however, that
he was inside, he gave a quick look around him.

""Much death here--big death.  Many deaths.  Good, good!""

He sniffed round as if he was enjoying the scent.  The matter and
manner of his speech were so revolting that instinctively Adam's
hand wandered to his revolver, and, with his finger on the trigger,
he rested satisfied that he was ready for any emergency.

There was certainly opportunity for the nigger's enjoyment, for the
open well-hole was almost under his nose, sending up such a stench
as almost made Adam sick, though Lady Arabella seemed not to mind it
at all.  It was like nothing that Adam had ever met with.  He
compared it with all the noxious experiences he had ever had--the
drainage of war hospitals, of slaughter-houses, the refuse of
dissecting rooms.  None of these was like it, though it had
something of them all, with, added, the sourness of chemical waste
and the poisonous effluvium of the bilge of a water-logged ship
whereon a multitude of rats had been drowned.

Then, quite unexpectedly, the negro noticed the presence of a third
person--Adam Salton!  He pulled out a pistol and shot at him,
happily missing.  Adam was himself usually a quick shot, but this
time his mind had been on something else and he was not ready.
However, he was quick to carry out an intention, and he was not a
coward.  In another moment both men were in grips.  Beside them was
the dark well-hole, with that horrid effluvium stealing up from its
mysterious depths.

Adam and Oolanga both had pistols; Lady Arabella, who had not one,
was probably the most ready of them all in the theory of shooting,
but that being impossible, she made her effort in another way.
Gliding forward, she tried to seize the African; but he eluded her
grasp, just missing, in doing so, falling into the mysterious hole.
As he swayed back to firm foothold, he turned his own gun on her and
shot.  Instinctively Adam leaped at his assailant; clutching at each
other, they tottered on the very brink.

Lady Arabella's anger, now fully awake, was all for Oolanga.  She
moved towards him with her hands extended, and had just seized him
when the catch of the locked box--due to some movement from within--
flew open, and the king-cobra-killer flew at her with a venomous
fury impossible to describe.  As it seized her throat, she caught
hold of it, and, with a fury superior to its own, tore it in two
just as if it had been a sheet of paper.  The strength used for such
an act must have been terrific.  In an instant, it seemed to spout
blood and entrails, and was hurled into the well-hole.  In another
instant she had seized Oolanga, and with a swift rush had drawn him,
her white arms encircling him, down with her into the gaping
aperture.

Adam saw a medley of green and red lights blaze in a whirling
circle, and as it sank down into the well, a pair of blazing green
eyes became fixed, sank lower and lower with frightful rapidity, and
disappeared, throwing upward the green light which grew more and
more vivid every moment.  As the light sank into the noisome depths,
there came a shriek which chilled Adam's blood--a prolonged agony of
pain and terror which seemed to have no end.

Adam Salton felt that he would never be able to free his mind from
the memory of those dreadful moments.  The gloom which surrounded
that horrible charnel pit, which seemed to go down to the very
bowels of the earth, conveyed from far down the sights and sounds of
the nethermost hell.  The ghastly fate of the African as he sank
down to his terrible doom, his black face growing grey with terror,
his white eyeballs, now like veined bloodstone, rolling in the
helpless extremity of fear.  The mysterious green light was in
itself a milieu of horror.  And through it all the awful cry came up
from that fathomless pit, whose entrance was flooded with spots of
fresh blood.  Even the death of the fearless little snake-killer--so
fierce, so frightful, as if stained with a ferocity which told of no
living force above earth, but only of the devils of the pit--was
only an incident.  Adam was in a state of intellectual tumult, which
had no parallel in his experience.  He tried to rush away from the
horrible place; even the baleful green light, thrown up through the
gloomy well-shaft, was dying away as its source sank deeper into the
primeval ooze.  The darkness was closing in on him in overwhelming
density--darkness in such a place and with such a memory of it!

He made a wild rush forward--slipt on the steps in some sticky,
acrid-smelling mass that felt and smelt like blood, and, falling
forward, felt his way into the inner room, where the well-shaft was
not.

Then he rubbed his eyes in sheer amazement.  Up the stone steps from
the narrow door by which he had entered, glided the white-clad
figure of Lady Arabella, the only colour to be seen on her being
blood-marks on her face and hands and throat.  Otherwise, she was
calm and unruffled, as when earlier she stood aside for him to pass
in through the narrow iron door.



CHAPTER XIX--AN ENEMY IN THE DARK



Adam Salton went for a walk before returning to Lesser Hill; he felt
that it might be well, not only to steady his nerves, shaken by the
horrible scene, but to get his thoughts into some sort of order, so
as to be ready to enter on the matter with Sir Nathaniel.  He was a
little embarrassed as to telling his uncle, for affairs had so
vastly progressed beyond his original view that he felt a little
doubtful as to what would be the old gentleman's attitude when he
should hear of the strange events for the first time.  Mr. Salton
would certainly not be satisfied at being treated as an outsider
with regard to such things, most of which had points of contact with
the inmates of his own house.  It was with an immense sense of
relief that Adam heard that his uncle had telegraphed to the
housekeeper that he was detained by business at Walsall, where he
would remain for the night; and that he would be back in the morning
in time for lunch.

When Adam got home after his walk, he found Sir Nathaniel just going
to bed.  He did not say anything to him then of what had happened,
but contented himself with arranging that they would walk together
in the early morning, as he had much to say that would require
serious attention.

Strangely enough he slept well, and awoke at dawn with his mind
clear and his nerves in their usual unshaken condition.  The maid
brought up, with his early morning cup of tea, a note which had been
found in the letter-box.  It was from Lady Arabella, and was
evidently intended to put him on his guard as to what he should say
about the previous evening.

He read it over carefully several times, before he was satisfied
that he had taken in its full import.


""DEAR MR. SALTON,

""I cannot go to bed until I have written to you, so you must forgive
me if I disturb you, and at an unseemly time.  Indeed, you must also
forgive me if, in trying to do what is right, I err in saying too
much or too little.  The fact is that I am quite upset and unnerved
by all that has happened in this terrible night.  I find it
difficult even to write; my hands shake so that they are not under
control, and I am trembling all over with memory of the horrors we
saw enacted before our eyes.  I am grieved beyond measure that I
should be, however remotely, a cause of this horror coming on you.
Forgive me if you can, and do not think too hardly of me.  This I
ask with confidence, for since we shared together the danger--the
very pangs--of death, I feel that we should be to one another
something more than mere friends, that I may lean on you and trust
you, assured that your sympathy and pity are for me.  You really
must let me thank you for the friendliness, the help, the
confidence, the real aid at a time of deadly danger and deadly fear
which you showed me.  That awful man--I shall see him for ever in my
dreams.  His black, malignant face will shut out all memory of
sunshine and happiness.  I shall eternally see his evil eyes as he
threw himself into that well-hole in a vain effort to escape from
the consequences of his own misdoing.  The more I think of it, the
more apparent it seems to me that he had premeditated the whole
thing--of course, except his own horrible death.

""Perhaps you have noticed a fur collar I occasionally wear.  It is
one of my most valued treasures--an ermine collar studded with
emeralds.  I had often seen the nigger's eyes gleam covetously when
he looked at it.  Unhappily, I wore it yesterday.  That may have
been the cause that lured the poor man to his doom.  On the very
brink of the abyss he tore the collar from my neck--that was the
last I saw of him.  When he sank into the hole, I was rushing to the
iron door, which I pulled behind me.  When I heard that soul-
sickening yell, which marked his disappearance in the chasm, I was
more glad than I can say that my eyes were spared the pain and
horror which my ears had to endure.

""When I tore myself out of the negro's grasp as he sank into the
well-hole; I realised what freedom meant.  Freedom!  Freedom!  Not
only from that noisome prison-house, which has now such a memory,
but from the more noisome embrace of that hideous monster.  Whilst I
live, I shall always thank you for my freedom.  A woman must
sometimes express her gratitude; otherwise it becomes too great to
bear.  I am not a sentimental girl, who merely likes to thank a man;
I am a woman who knows all, of bad as well as good, that life can
give.  I have known what it is to love and to lose.  But you must
not let me bring any unhappiness into your life.  I must live on--as
I have lived--alone, and, in addition, bear with other woes the
memory of this latest insult and horror.  In the meantime, I must
get away as quickly as possible from Diana's Grove.  In the morning
I shall go up to town, where I shall remain for a week--I cannot
stay longer, as business affairs demand my presence here.  I think,
however, that a week in the rush of busy London, surrounded with
multitudes of commonplace people, will help to soften--I cannot
expect total obliteration--the terrible images of the bygone night.
When I can sleep easily--which will be, I hope, after a day or two--
I shall be fit to return home and take up again the burden which
will, I suppose, always be with me.

""I shall be most happy to see you on my return--or earlier, if my
good fortune sends you on any errand to London.  I shall stay at the
Mayfair Hotel.  In that busy spot we may forget some of the dangers
and horrors we have shared together.  Adieu, and thank you, again
and again, for all your kindness and consideration to me.

""ARABELLA MARSH.""


Adam was surprised by this effusive epistle, but he determined to
say nothing of it to Sir Nathaniel until he should have thought it
well over.  When Adam met Sir Nathaniel at breakfast, he was glad
that he had taken time to turn things over in his mind.  The result
had been that not only was he familiar with the facts in all their
bearings, but he had already so far differentiated them that he was
able to arrange them in his own mind according to their values.
Breakfast had been a silent function, so it did not interfere in any
way with the process of thought.

So soon as the door was closed, Sir Nathaniel began:

""I see, Adam, that something has occurred, and that you have much to
tell me.""

""That is so, sir.  I suppose I had better begin by telling you all I
know--all that has happened since I left you yesterday?""

Accordingly Adam gave him details of all that had happened during
the previous evening.  He confined himself rigidly to the narration
of circumstances, taking care not to colour events by any comment of
his own, or any opinion of the meaning of things which he did not
fully understand.  At first, Sir Nathaniel seemed disposed to ask
questions, but shortly gave this up when he recognised that the
narration was concise and self-explanatory.  Thenceforth, he
contented himself with quick looks and glances, easily interpreted,
or by some acquiescent motions of his hands, when such could be
convenient, to emphasise his idea of the correctness of any
inference.  Until Adam ceased speaking, having evidently come to an
end of what he had to say with regard to this section of his story,
the elder man made no comment whatever.  Even when Adam took from
his pocket Lady Arabella's letter, with the manifest intention of
reading it, he did not make any comment.  Finally, when Adam folded
up the letter and put it, in its envelope, back in his pocket, as an
intimation that he had now quite finished, the old diplomatist
carefully made a few notes in his pocket-book.

""Your narrative, my dear Adam, is altogether admirable.  I think I
may now take it that we are both well versed in the actual facts,
and that our conference had better take the shape of a mutual
exchange of ideas.  Let us both ask questions as they may arise; and
I do not doubt that we shall arrive at some enlightening
conclusions.""

""Will you kindly begin, sir?  I do not doubt that, with your longer
experience, you will be able to dissipate some of the fog which
envelops certain of the things which we have to consider.""

""I hope so, my dear boy.  For a beginning, then, let me say that
Lady Arabella's letter makes clear some things which she intended--
and also some things which she did not intend.  But, before I begin
to draw deductions, let me ask you a few questions.  Adam, are you
heart-whole, quite heart-whole, in the matter of Lady Arabella?""

His companion answered at once, each looking the other straight in
the eyes during question and answer.

""Lady Arabella, sir, is a charming woman, and I should have deemed
it a privilege to meet her--to talk to her--even--since I am in the
confessional--to flirt a little with her.  But if you mean to ask if
my affections are in any way engaged, I can emphatically answer
'No!'--as indeed you will understand when presently I give you the
reason.  Apart from that, there are the unpleasant details we
discussed the other day.""

""Could you--would you mind giving me the reason now?  It will help
us to understand what is before us, in the way of difficulty.""

""Certainly, sir.  My reason, on which I can fully depend, is that I
love another woman!""

""That clinches it.  May I offer my good wishes, and, I hope, my
congratulations?""

""I am proud of your good wishes, sir, and I thank you for them.  But
it is too soon for congratulations--the lady does not even know my
hopes yet.  Indeed, I hardly knew them myself, as definite, till
this moment.""

""I take it then, Adam, that at the right time I may be allowed to
know who the lady is?""

Adam laughed a low, sweet laugh, such as ripples from a happy heart.

""There need not be an hour's, a minute's delay.  I shall be glad to
share my secret with you, sir.  The lady, sir, whom I am so happy as
to love, and in whom my dreams of life-long happiness are centred,
is Mimi Watford!""

""Then, my dear Adam, I need not wait to offer congratulations.  She
is indeed a very charming young lady.  I do not think I ever saw a
girl who united in such perfection the qualities of strength of
character and sweetness of disposition.  With all my heart, I
congratulate you.  Then I may take it that my question as to your
heart-wholeness is answered in the affirmative?""

""Yes; and now, sir, may I ask in turn why the question?""

""Certainly!  I asked because it seems to me that we are coming to a
point where my questions might be painful to you.""

""It is not merely that I love Mimi, but I have reason to look on
Lady Arabella as her enemy,"" Adam continued.

""Her enemy?""

""Yes.  A rank and unscrupulous enemy who is bent on her
destruction.""

Sir Nathaniel went to the door, looked outside it and returned,
locking it carefully behind him.



CHAPTER XX--METABOLISM



""Am I looking grave?"" asked Sir Nathaniel inconsequently when he re-
entered the room.

""You certainly are, sir.""

""We little thought when first we met that we should be drawn into
such a vortex.  Already we are mixed up in robbery, and probably
murder, but--a thousand times worse than all the crimes in the
calendar--in an affair of ghastly mystery which has no bottom and no
end--with forces of the most unnerving kind, which had their origin
in an age when the world was different from the world which we know.
We are going back to the origin of superstition--to an age when
dragons tore each other in their slime.  We must fear nothing--no
conclusion, however improbable, almost impossible it may be.  Life
and death is hanging on our judgment, not only for ourselves, but
for others whom we love.  Remember, I count on you as I hope you
count on me.""

""I do, with all confidence.""

""Then,"" said Sir Nathaniel, ""let us think justly and boldly and fear
nothing, however terrifying it may seem.  I suppose I am to take as
exact in every detail your account of all the strange things which
happened whilst you were in Diana's Grove?""

""So far as I know, yes.  Of course I may be mistaken in recollection
of some detail or another, but I am certain that in the main what I
have said is correct.""

""You feel sure that you saw Lady Arabella seize the negro round the
neck, and drag him down with her into the hole?""

""Absolutely certain, sir, otherwise I should have gone to her
assistance.""

""We have, then, an account of what happened from an eye-witness whom
we trust--that is yourself.  We have also another account, written
by Lady Arabella under her own hand.  These two accounts do not
agree.  Therefore we must take it that one of the two is lying.""

""Apparently, sir.""

""And that Lady Arabella is the liar!""

""Apparently--as I am not.""

""We must, therefore, try to find a reason for her lying.  She has
nothing to fear from Oolanga, who is dead.  Therefore the only
reason which could actuate her would be to convince someone else
that she was blameless.  This 'someone' could not be you, for you
had the evidence of your own eyes.  There was no one else present;
therefore it must have been an absent person.""

""That seems beyond dispute, sir.""

""There is only one other person whose good opinion she could wish to
keep--Edgar Caswall.  He is the only one who fills the bill.  Her
lies point to other things besides the death of the African.  She
evidently wanted it to be accepted that his falling into the well
was his own act.  I cannot suppose that she expected to convince
you, the eye-witness; but if she wished later on to spread the
story, it was wise of her to try to get your acceptance of it.""

""That is so!""

""Then there were other matters of untruth.  That, for instance, of
the ermine collar embroidered with emeralds.  If an understandable
reason be required for this, it would be to draw attention away from
the green lights which were seen in the room, and especially in the
well-hole.  Any unprejudiced person would accept the green lights to
be the eyes of a great snake, such as tradition pointed to living in
the well-hole.  In fine, therefore, Lady Arabella wanted the general
belief to be that there was no snake of the kind in Diana's Grove.
For my own part, I don't believe in a partial liar--this art does
not deal in veneer; a liar is a liar right through.  Self-interest
may prompt falsity of the tongue; but if one prove to be a liar,
nothing that he says can ever be believed.  This leads us to the
conclusion that because she said or inferred that there was no
snake, we should look for one--and expect to find it, too.

""Now let me digress.  I live, and have for many years lived, in
Derbyshire, a county more celebrated for its caves than any other
county in England.  I have been through them all, and am familiar
with every turn of them; as also with other great caves in Kentucky,
in France, in Germany, and a host of other places--in many of these
are tremendously deep caves of narrow aperture, which are valued by
intrepid explorers, who descend narrow gullets of abysmal depth--and
sometimes never return.  In many of the caverns in the Peak I am
convinced that some of the smaller passages were used in primeval
times as the lairs of some of the great serpents of legend and
tradition.  It may have been that such caverns were formed in the
usual geologic way--bubbles or flaws in the earth's crust--which
were later used by the monsters of the period of the young world.
It may have been, of course, that some of them were worn originally
by water; but in time they all found a use when suitable for living
monsters.

""This brings us to another point, more difficult to accept and
understand than any other requiring belief in a base not usually
accepted, or indeed entered on--whether such abnormal growths could
have ever changed in their nature.  Some day the study of metabolism
may progress so far as to enable us to accept structural changes
proceeding from an intellectual or moral base.  We may lean towards
a belief that great animal strength may be a sound base for changes
of all sorts.  If this be so, what could be a more fitting subject
than primeval monsters whose strength was such as to allow a
survival of thousands of years?  We do not know yet if brain can
increase and develop independently of other parts of the living
structure.

""After all, the mediaeval belief in the Philosopher's Stone which
could transmute metals, has its counterpart in the accepted theory
of metabolism which changes living tissue.  In an age of
investigation like our own, when we are returning to science as the
base of wonders--almost of miracles--we should be slow to refuse to
accept facts, however impossible they may seem to be.

""Let us suppose a monster of the early days of the world--a dragon
of the prime--of vast age running into thousands of years, to whom
had been conveyed in some way--it matters not--a brain just
sufficient for the beginning of growth.  Suppose the monster to be
of incalculable size and of a strength quite abnormal--a veritable
incarnation of animal strength.  Suppose this animal is allowed to
remain in one place, thus being removed from accidents of
interrupted development; might not, would not this creature, in
process of time--ages, if necessary--have that rudimentary
intelligence developed?  There is no impossibility in this; it is
only the natural process of evolution.  In the beginning, the
instincts of animals are confined to alimentation, self-protection,
and the multiplication of their species.  As time goes on and the
needs of life become more complex, power follows need.  We have been
long accustomed to consider growth as applied almost exclusively to
size in its various aspects.  But Nature, who has no doctrinaire
ideas, may equally apply it to concentration.  A developing thing
may expand in any given way or form.  Now, it is a scientific law
that increase implies gain and loss of various kinds; what a thing
gains in one direction it may lose in another.  May it not be that
Mother Nature may deliberately encourage decrease as well as
increase--that it may be an axiom that what is gained in
concentration is lost in size?  Take, for instance, monsters that
tradition has accepted and localised, such as the Worm of Lambton or
that of Spindleston Heugh.  If such a creature were, by its own
process of metabolism, to change much of its bulk for intellectual
growth, we should at once arrive at a new class of creature--more
dangerous, perhaps, than the world has ever had any experience of--a
force which can think, which has no soul and no morals, and
therefore no acceptance of responsibility.  A snake would be a good
illustration of this, for it is cold-blooded, and therefore removed
from the temptations which often weaken or restrict warm-blooded
creatures.  If, for instance, the Worm of Lambton--if such ever
existed--were guided to its own ends by an organised intelligence
capable of expansion, what form of creature could we imagine which
would equal it in potentialities of evil?  Why, such a being would
devastate a whole country.  Now, all these things require much
thought, and we want to apply the knowledge usefully, and we should
therefore be exact.  Would it not be well to resume the subject
later in the day?""

""I quite agree, sir.  I am in a whirl already; and want to attend
carefully to what you say; so that I may try to digest it.""

Both men seemed fresher and better for the ""easy,"" and when they met
in the afternoon each of them had something to contribute to the
general stock of information.  Adam, who was by nature of a more
militant disposition than his elderly friend, was glad to see that
the conference at once assumed a practical trend.  Sir Nathaniel
recognised this, and, like an old diplomatist, turned it to present
use.

""Tell me now, Adam, what is the outcome, in your own mind, of our
conversation?""

""That the whole difficulty already assumes practical shape; but with
added dangers, that at first I did not imagine.""

""What is the practical shape, and what are the added dangers?  I am
not disputing, but only trying to clear my own ideas by the
consideration of yours--""

So Adam went on:

""In the past, in the early days of the world, there were monsters
who were so vast that they could exist for thousands of years.  Some
of them must have overlapped the Christian era.  They may have
progressed intellectually in process of time.  If they had in any
way so progressed, or even got the most rudimentary form of brain,
they would be the most dangerous things that ever were in the world.
Tradition says that one of these monsters lived in the Marsh of the
East, and came up to a cave in Diana's Grove, which was also called
the Lair of the White Worm.  Such creatures may have grown down as
well as up.  They MAY have grown into, or something like, human
beings.  Lady Arabella March is of snake nature.  She has committed
crimes to our knowledge.  She retains something of the vast strength
of her primal being--can see in the dark--has the eyes of a snake.
She used the nigger, and then dragged him through the snake's hole
down to the swamp; she is intent on evil, and hates some one we
love.  Result. . . ""

""Yes, the result?""

""First, that Mimi Watford should be taken away at once--then--""

""Yes?""

""The monster must be destroyed.""

""Bravo!  That is a true and fearless conclusion.  At whatever cost,
it must be carried out.""

""At once?""

""Soon, at all events.  That creature's very existence is a danger.
Her presence in this neighbourhood makes the danger immediate.""

As he spoke, Sir Nathaniel's mouth hardened and his eyebrows came
down till they met.  There was no doubting his concurrence in the
resolution, or his readiness to help in carrying it out.  But he was
an elderly man with much experience and knowledge of law and
diplomacy.  It seemed to him to be a stern duty to prevent anything
irrevocable taking place till it had been thought out and all was
ready.  There were all sorts of legal cruxes to be thought out, not
only regarding the taking of life, even of a monstrosity in human
form, but also of property.  Lady Arabella, be she woman or snake or
devil, owned the ground she moved in, according to British law, and
the law is jealous and swift to avenge wrongs done within its ken.
All such difficulties should be--must be--avoided for Mr. Salton's
sake, for Adam's own sake, and, most of all, for Mimi Watford's
sake.

Before he spoke again, Sir Nathaniel had made up his mind that he
must try to postpone decisive action until the circumstances on
which they depended--which, after all, were only problematical--
should have been tested satisfactorily, one way or another.  When he
did speak, Adam at first thought that his friend was wavering in his
intention, or ""funking"" the responsibility.  However, his respect
for Sir Nathaniel was so great that he would not act, or even come
to a conclusion on a vital point, without his sanction.

He came close and whispered in his ear:

""We will prepare our plans to combat and destroy this horrible
menace, after we have cleared up some of the more baffling points.
Meanwhile, we must wait for the night--I hear my uncle's footsteps
echoing down the hall.""

Sir Nathaniel nodded his approval.



CHAPTER XXI--GREEN LIGHT



When old Mr. Salton had retired for the night, Adam and Sir
Nathaniel returned to the study.  Things went with great regularity
at Lesser Hill, so they knew that there would be no interruption to
their talk.

When their cigars were lighted, Sir Nathaniel began.

""I hope, Adam, that you do not think me either slack or changeable
of purpose.  I mean to go through this business to the bitter end--
whatever it may be.  Be satisfied that my first care is, and shall
be, the protection of Mimi Watford.  To that I am pledged; my dear
boy, we who are interested are all in the same danger.  That semi-
human monster out of the pit hates and means to destroy us all--you
and me certainly, and probably your uncle.  I wanted especially to
talk with you to-night, for I cannot help thinking that the time is
fast coming--if it has not come already--when we must take your
uncle into our confidence.  It was one thing when fancied evils
threatened, but now he is probably marked for death, and it is only
right that he should know all.""

""I am with you, sir.  Things have changed since we agreed to keep
him out of the trouble.  Now we dare not; consideration for his
feelings might cost his life.  It is a duty--and no light or
pleasant one, either.  I have not a shadow of doubt that he will
want to be one with us in this.  But remember, we are his guests;
his name, his honour, have to be thought of as well as his safety.""

""All shall be as you wish, Adam.  And now as to what we are to do?
We cannot murder Lady Arabella off-hand.  Therefore we shall have to
put things in order for the killing, and in such a way that we
cannot be taxed with a crime.""

""It seems to me, sir, that we are in an exceedingly tight place.
Our first difficulty is to know where to begin.  I never thought
this fighting an antediluvian monster would be such a complicated
job.  This one is a woman, with all a woman's wit, combined with the
heartlessness of a COCOTTE.  She has the strength and impregnability
of a diplodocus.  We may be sure that in the fight that is before us
there will be no semblance of fair-play.  Also that our unscrupulous
opponent will not betray herself!""

""That is so--but being feminine, she will probably over-reach
herself.  Now, Adam, it strikes me that, as we have to protect
ourselves and others against feminine nature, our strong game will
be to play our masculine against her feminine.  Perhaps we had
better sleep on it.  She is a thing of the night; and the night may
give us some ideas.""

So they both turned in.

Adam knocked at Sir Nathaniel's door in the grey of the morning,
and, on being bidden, came into the room.  He had several letters in
his hand.  Sir Nathaniel sat up in bed.

""Well!""

""I should like to read you a few letters, but, of course, I shall
not send them unless you approve.  In fact""--with a smile and a
blush--""there are several things which I want to do; but I hold my
hand and my tongue till I have your approval.""

""Go on!"" said the other kindly.  ""Tell me all, and count at any rate
on my sympathy, and on my approval and help if I can see my way.""

Accordingly Adam proceeded:

""When I told you the conclusions at which I had arrived, I put in
the foreground that Mimi Watford should, for the sake of her own
safety, be removed--and that the monster which had wrought all the
harm should be destroyed.""

""Yes, that is so.""

""To carry this into practice, sir, one preliminary is required--
unless harm of another kind is to be faced.  Mimi should have some
protector whom all the world would recognise.  The only form
recognised by convention is marriage!""

Sir Nathaniel smiled in a fatherly way.

""To marry, a husband is required.  And that husband should be you.""

""Yes, yes.""

""And the marriage should be immediate and secret--or, at least, not
spoken of outside ourselves.  Would the young lady be agreeable to
that proceeding?""

""I do not know, sir!""

""Then how are we to proceed?""

""I suppose that we--or one of us--must ask her.""

""Is this a sudden idea, Adam, a sudden resolution?""

""A sudden resolution, sir, but not a sudden idea.  If she agrees,
all is well and good.  The sequence is obvious.""

""And it is to be kept a secret amongst ourselves?""

""I want no secret, sir, except for Mimi's good.  For myself, I
should like to shout it from the house-tops!  But we must be
discreet; untimely knowledge to our enemy might work incalculable
harm.""

""And how would you suggest, Adam, that we could combine the
momentous question with secrecy?""

Adam grew red and moved uneasily.

""Someone must ask her--as soon as possible!""

""And that someone?""

""I thought that you, sir, would be so good!""

""God bless my soul!  This is a new kind of duty to take on--at my
time of life.  Adam, I hope you know that you can count on me to
help in any way I can!""

""I have already counted on you, sir, when I ventured to make such a
suggestion.  I can only ask,"" he added, ""that you will be more than
ever kind to me--to us--and look on the painful duty as a voluntary
act of grace, prompted by kindness and affection.""

""Painful duty!""

""Yes,"" said Adam boldly.  ""Painful to you, though to me it would be
all joyful.""

""It is a strange job for an early morning!  Well, we all live and
learn.  I suppose the sooner I go the better.  You had better write
a line for me to take with me.  For, you see, this is to be a
somewhat unusual transaction, and it may be embarrassing to the
lady, even to myself.  So we ought to have some sort of warrant,
something to show that we have been mindful of her feelings.  It
will not do to take acquiescence for granted--although we act for
her good.""

""Sir Nathaniel, you are a true friend; I am sure that both Mimi and
I shall be grateful to you for all our lives--however long they may
be!""

So the two talked it over and agreed as to points to be borne in
mind by the ambassador.  It was striking ten when Sir Nathaniel left
the house, Adam seeing him quietly off.

As the young man followed him with wistful eyes--almost jealous of
the privilege which his kind deed was about to bring him--he felt
that his own heart was in his friend's breast.

The memory of that morning was like a dream to all those concerned
in it.  Sir Nathaniel had a confused recollection of detail and
sequence, though the main facts stood out in his memory boldly and
clearly.  Adam Salton's recollection was of an illimitable wait,
filled with anxiety, hope, and chagrin, all dominated by a sense of
the slow passage of time and accompanied by vague fears.  Mimi could
not for a long time think at all, or recollect anything, except that
Adam loved her and was saving her from a terrible danger.  When she
had time to think, later on, she wondered when she had any ignorance
of the fact that Adam loved her, and that she loved him with all her
heart.  Everything, every recollection however small, every feeling,
seemed to fit into those elemental facts as though they had all been
moulded together.  The main and crowning recollection was her saying
goodbye to Sir Nathaniel, and entrusting to him loving messages,
straight from her heart, to Adam Salton, and of his bearing when--
with an impulse which she could not check--she put her lips to his
and kissed him.  Later, when she was alone and had time to think, it
was a passing grief to her that she would have to be silent, for a
time, to Lilla on the happy events of that strange mission.

She had, of course, agreed to keep all secret until Adam should give
her leave to speak.

The advice and assistance of Sir Nathaniel was a great help to Adam
in carrying out his idea of marrying Mimi Watford without publicity.
He went with him to London, and, with his influence, the young man
obtained the license of the Archbishop of Canterbury for a private
marriage.  Sir Nathaniel then persuaded old Mr. Salton to allow his
nephew to spend a few weeks with him at Doom Tower, and it was here
that Mimi became Adam's wife.  But that was only the first step in
their plans; before going further, however, Adam took his bride off
to the Isle of Man.  He wished to place a stretch of sea between
Mimi and the White Worm, while things matured.  On their return, Sir
Nathaniel met them and drove them at once to Doom, taking care to
avoid any one that he knew on the journey.

Sir Nathaniel had taken care to have the doors and windows shut and
locked--all but the door used for their entry.  The shutters were up
and the blinds down.  Moreover, heavy curtains were drawn across the
windows.  When Adam commented on this, Sir Nathaniel said in a
whisper:

""Wait till we are alone, and I'll tell you why this is done; in the
meantime not a word or a sign.  You will approve when we have had a
talk together.""

They said no more on the subject till after dinner, when they were
ensconced in Sir Nathaniel's study, which was on the top storey.
Doom Tower was a lofty structure, situated on an eminence high up in
the Peak.  The top commanded a wide prospect, ranging from the hills
above the Ribble to the near side of the Brow, which marked the
northern bound of ancient Mercia.  It was of the early Norman
period, less than a century younger than Castra Regis.  The windows
of the study were barred and locked, and heavy dark curtains closed
them in.  When this was done not a gleam of light from the tower
could be seen from outside.

When they were alone, Sir Nathaniel explained that he had taken his
old friend, Mr. Salton, into full confidence, and that in future all
would work together.

""It is important for you to be extremely careful.  In spite of the
fact that our marriage was kept secret, as also your temporary
absence, both are known.""

""How?  To whom?""

""How, I know not; but I am beginning to have an idea.""

""To her?"" asked Adam, in momentary consternation.

Sir Nathaniel shivered perceptibly.

""The White Worm--yes!""

Adam noticed that from now on, his friend never spoke of Lady
Arabella otherwise, except when he wished to divert the suspicion of
others.

Sir Nathaniel switched off the electric light, and when the room was
pitch dark, he came to Adam, took him by the hand, and led him to a
seat set in the southern window.  Then he softly drew back a piece
of the curtain and motioned his companion to look out.

Adam did so, and immediately shrank back as though his eyes had
opened on pressing danger.  His companion set his mind at rest by
saying in a low voice:

""It is all right; you may speak, but speak low.  There is no danger
here--at present!""

Adam leaned forward, taking care, however, not to press his face
against the glass.  What he saw would not under ordinary
circumstances have caused concern to anybody.  With his special
knowledge, it was appalling--though the night was now so dark that
in reality there was little to be seen.

On the western side of the tower stood a grove of old trees, of
forest dimensions.  They were not grouped closely, but stood a
little apart from each other, producing the effect of a row widely
planted.  Over the tops of them was seen a green light, something
like the danger signal at a railway-crossing.  It seemed at first
quite still; but presently, when Adam's eye became accustomed to it,
he could see that it moved as if trembling.  This at once recalled
to Adam's mind the light quivering above the well-hole in the
darkness of that inner room at Diana's Grove, Oolanga's awful
shriek, and the hideous black face, now grown grey with terror,
disappearing into the impenetrable gloom of the mysterious orifice.
Instinctively he laid his hand on his revolver, and stood up ready
to protect his wife.  Then, seeing that nothing happened, and that
the light and all outside the tower remained the same, he softly
pulled the curtain over the window.

Sir Nathaniel switched on the light again, and in its comforting
glow they began to talk freely.



CHAPTER XXII--AT CLOSE QUARTERS



""She has diabolical cunning,"" said Sir Nathaniel.  ""Ever since you
left, she has ranged along the Brow and wherever you were accustomed
to frequent.  I have not heard whence the knowledge of your
movements came to her, nor have I been able to learn any data
whereon to found an opinion.  She seems to have heard both of your
marriage and your absence; but I gather, by inference, that she does
not actually know where you and Mimi are, or of your return.  So
soon as the dusk fails, she goes out on her rounds, and before dawn
covers the whole ground round the Brow, and away up into the heart
of the Peak.  The White Worm, in her own proper shape, certainly has
great facilities for the business on which she is now engaged.  She
can look into windows of any ordinary kind.  Happily, this house is
beyond her reach, if she wishes--as she manifestly does--to remain
unrecognised.  But, even at this height, it is wise to show no
lights, lest she might learn something of our presence or absence.""

""Would it not be well, sir, if one of us could see this monster in
her real shape at close quarters?  I am willing to run the risk--for
I take it there would be no slight risk in the doing.  I don't
suppose anyone of our time has seen her close and lived to tell the
tale.""

Sir Nathaniel held up an expostulatory hand.

""Good God, lad, what are you suggesting?  Think of your wife, and
all that is at stake.""

""It is of Mimi that I think--for her sake that I am willing to risk
whatever is to be risked.""

Adam's young bride was proud of her man, but she blanched at the
thought of the ghastly White Worm.  Adam saw this and at once
reassured her.

""So long as her ladyship does not know whereabout I am, I shall have
as much safety as remains to us; bear in mind, my darling, that we
cannot be too careful.""

Sir Nathaniel realised that Adam was right; the White Worm had no
supernatural powers and could not harm them until she discovered
their hiding place.  It was agreed, therefore, that the two men
should go together.

When the two men slipped out by the back door of the house, they
walked cautiously along the avenue which trended towards the west.
Everything was pitch dark--so dark that at times they had to feel
their way by the palings and tree-trunks.  They could still see,
seemingly far in front of them and high up, the baleful light which
at the height and distance seemed like a faint line.  As they were
now on the level of the ground, the light seemed infinitely higher
than it had from the top of the tower.  At the sight Adam's heart
fell; the danger of the desperate enterprise which he had undertaken
burst upon him.  But this feeling was shortly followed by another
which restored him to himself--a fierce loathing, and a desire to
kill, such as he had never experienced before.

They went on for some distance on a level road, fairly wide, from
which the green light was visible.  Here Sir Nathaniel spoke softly,
placing his lips to Adam's ear for safety.

""We know nothing whatever of this creature's power of hearing or
smelling, though I presume that both are of no great strength.  As
to seeing, we may presume the opposite, but in any case we must try
to keep in the shade behind the tree-trunks.  The slightest error
would be fatal to us.""

Adam only nodded, in case there should be any chance of the monster
seeing the movement.

After a time that seemed interminable, they emerged from the
circling wood.  It was like coming out into sunlight by comparison
with the misty blackness which had been around them.  There was
light enough to see by, though not sufficient to distinguish things
at a distance.  Adam's eyes sought the green light in the sky.  It
was still in about the same place, but its surroundings were more
visible.  It was now at the summit of what seemed to be a long white
pole, near the top of which were two pendant white masses, like
rudimentary arms or fins.  The green light, strangely enough, did
not seem lessened by the surrounding starlight, but had a clearer
effect and a deeper green.  Whilst they were carefully regarding
this--Adam with the aid of an opera-glass--their nostrils were
assailed by a horrid stench, something like that which rose from the
well-hole in Diana's Grove.

By degrees, as their eyes got the right focus, they saw an immense
towering mass that seemed snowy white.  It was tall and thin.  The
lower part was hidden by the trees which lay between, but they could
follow the tall white shaft and the duplicate green lights which
topped it.  As they looked there was a movement--the shaft seemed to
bend, and the line of green light descended amongst the trees.  They
could see the green light twinkle as it passed between the
obstructing branches.

Seeing where the head of the monster was, the two men ventured a
little further forward, and saw that the hidden mass at the base of
the shaft was composed of vast coils of the great serpent's body,
forming a base from which the upright mass rose.  As they looked,
this lower mass moved, the glistening folds catching the moonlight,
and they could see that the monster's progress was along the ground.
It was coming towards them at a swift pace, so they turned and ran,
taking care to make as little noise as possible, either by their
footfalls or by disturbing the undergrowth close to them.  They did
not stop or pause till they saw before them the high dark tower of
Doom.



CHAPTER XXIII--IN THE ENEMY'S HOUSE



Sir Nathaniel was in the library next morning, after breakfast, when
Adam came to him carrying a letter.

""Her ladyship doesn't lose any time.  She has begun work already!""

Sir Nathaniel, who was writing at a table near the window, looked
up.

""What is it?"" said he.

Adam held out the letter he was carrying.  It was in a blazoned
envelope.

""Ha!"" said Sir Nathaniel, ""from the White Worm!  I expected
something of the kind.""

""But,"" said Adam, ""how could she have known we were here?  She
didn't know last night.""

""I don't think we need trouble about that, Adam.  There is so much
we do not understand.  This is only another mystery.  Suffice it
that she does know--perhaps it is all the better and safer for us.""

""How is that?"" asked Adam with a puzzled look.

""General process of reasoning, my boy; and the experience of some
years in the diplomatic world.  This creature is a monster without
heart or consideration for anything or anyone.  She is not nearly so
dangerous in the open as when she has the dark to protect her.
Besides, we know, by our own experience of her movements, that for
some reason she shuns publicity.  In spite of her vast bulk and
abnormal strength, she is afraid to attack openly.  After all, she
is only a snake and with a snake's nature, which is to keep low and
squirm, and proceed by stealth and cunning.  She will never attack
when she can run away, although she knows well that running away
would probably be fatal to her.  What is the letter about?""

Sir Nathaniel's voice was calm and self-possessed.  When he was
engaged in any struggle of wits he was all diplomatist.

""She asks Mimi and me to tea this afternoon at Diana's Grove, and
hopes that you also will favour her.""

Sir Nathaniel smiled.

""Please ask Mrs. Salton to accept for us all.""

""She means some deadly mischief.  Surely--surely it would be wiser
not.""

""It is an old trick that we learn early in diplomacy, Adam--to fight
on ground of your own choice.  It is true that she suggested the
place on this occasion; but by accepting it we make it ours.
Moreover, she will not be able to understand our reason for doing
so, and her own bad conscience--if she has any, bad or good--and her
own fears and doubts will play our game for us.  No, my dear boy,
let us accept, by all means.""

Adam said nothing, but silently held out his hand, which his
companion shook:  no words were necessary.

When it was getting near tea-time, Mimi asked Sir Nathaniel how they
were going.

""We must make a point of going in state.  We want all possible
publicity.""  Mimi looked at him inquiringly.  ""Certainly, my dear,
in the present circumstances publicity is a part of safety.  Do not
be surprised if, whilst we are at Diana's Grove, occasional messages
come for you--for all or any of us.""

""I see!"" said Mrs. Salton.  ""You are taking no chances.""

""None, my dear.  All I have learned at foreign courts, and amongst
civilised and uncivilised people, is going to be utilised within the
next couple of hours.""

Sir Nathaniel's voice was full of seriousness, and it brought to
Mimi in a convincing way the awful gravity of the occasion

In due course, they set out in a carriage drawn by a fine pair of
horses, who soon devoured the few miles of their journey.  Before
they came to the gate, Sir Nathaniel turned to Mimi.

""I have arranged with Adam certain signals which may be necessary if
certain eventualities occur.  These need be nothing to do with you
directly.  But bear in mind that if I ask you or Adam to do
anything, do not lose a second in the doing of it.  We must try to
pass off such moments with an appearance of unconcern.  In all
probability, nothing requiring such care will occur.  The White Worm
will not try force, though she has so much of it to spare.  Whatever
she may attempt to-day, of harm to any of us, will be in the way of
secret plot.  Some other time she may try force, but--if I am able
to judge such a thing--not to-day.  The messengers who may ask for
any of us will not be witnesses only, they may help to stave off
danger.""  Seeing query in her face, he went on:  ""Of what kind the
danger may be, I know not, and cannot guess.  It will doubtless be
some ordinary circumstance; but none the less dangerous on that
account.  Here we are at the gate.  Now, be careful in all matters,
however small.  To keep your head is half the battle.""

There were a number of men in livery in the hall when they arrived.
The doors of the drawing-room were thrown open, and Lady Arabella
came forth and offered them cordial welcome.  This having been got
over, Lady Arabella led them into another room where tea was served.

Adam was acutely watchful and suspicious of everything, and saw on
the far side of this room a panelled iron door of the same colour
and configuration as the outer door of the room where was the well-
hole wherein Oolanga had disappeared.  Something in the sight
alarmed him, and he quietly stood near the door.  He made no
movement, even of his eyes, but he could see that Sir Nathaniel was
watching him intently, and, he fancied, with approval.

They all sat near the table spread for tea, Adam still near the
door.  Lady Arabella fanned herself, complaining of heat, and told
one of the footmen to throw all the outer doors open.

Tea was in progress when Mimi suddenly started up with a look of
fright on her face; at the same moment, the men became cognisant of
a thick smoke which began to spread through the room--a smoke which
made those who experienced it gasp and choke.  The footmen began to
edge uneasily towards the inner door.  Denser and denser grew the
smoke, and more acrid its smell.  Mimi, towards whom the draught
from the open door wafted the smoke, rose up choking, and ran to the
inner door, which she threw open to its fullest extent, disclosing
on the outside a curtain of thin silk, fixed to the doorposts.  The
draught from the open door swayed the thin silk towards her, and in
her fright, she tore down the curtain, which enveloped her from head
to foot.  Then she ran through the still open door, heedless of the
fact that she could not see where she was going.  Adam, followed by
Sir Nathaniel, rushed forward and joined her--Adam catching his wife
by the arm and holding her tight.  It was well that he did so, for
just before her lay the black orifice of the well-hole, which, of
course, she could not see with the silk curtain round her head.  The
floor was extremely slippery; something like thick oil had been
spilled where she had to pass; and close to the edge of the hole her
feet shot from under her, and she stumbled forward towards the well-
hole.

When Adam saw Mimi slip, he flung himself backward, still holding
her.  His weight told, and he dragged her up from the hole and they
fell together on the floor outside the zone of slipperiness.  In a
moment he had raised her up, and together they rushed out through
the open door into the sunlight, Sir Nathaniel close behind them.
They were all pale except the old diplomatist, who looked both calm
and cool.  It sustained and cheered Adam and his wife to see him
thus master of himself.  Both managed to follow his example, to the
wonderment of the footmen, who saw the three who had just escaped a
terrible danger walking together gaily, as, under the guiding
pressure of Sir Nathaniel's hand, they turned to re-enter the house.

Lady Arabella, whose face had blanched to a deadly white, now
resumed her ministrations at the tea-board as though nothing unusual
had happened.  The slop-basin was full of half-burned brown paper,
over which tea had been poured.

Sir Nathaniel had been narrowly observing his hostess, and took the
first opportunity afforded him of whispering to Adam:

""The real attack is to come--she is too quiet.  When I give my hand
to your wife to lead her out, come with us--and caution her to
hurry.  Don't lose a second, even if you have to make a scene.  Hs-
s-s-h!""

Then they resumed their places close to the table, and the servants,
in obedience to Lady Arabella's order, brought in fresh tea.

Thence on, that tea-party seemed to Adam, whose faculties were at
their utmost intensity, like a terrible dream.  As for poor Mimi,
she was so overwrought both with present and future fear, and with
horror at the danger she had escaped, that her faculties were numb.
However, she was braced up for a trial, and she felt assured that
whatever might come she would be able to go through with it.  Sir
Nathaniel seemed just as usual--suave, dignified, and thoughtful--
perfect master of himself.

To her husband, it was evident that Mimi was ill at ease.  The way
she kept turning her head to look around her, the quick coming and
going of the colour of her face, her hurried breathing, alternating
with periods of suspicious calm, were evidences of mental
perturbation.  To her, the attitude of Lady Arabella seemed
compounded of social sweetness and personal consideration.  It would
be hard to imagine more thoughtful and tender kindness towards an
honoured guest.

When tea was over and the servants had come to clear away the cups,
Lady Arabella, putting her arm round Mimi's waist, strolled with her
into an adjoining room, where she collected a number of photographs
which were scattered about, and, sitting down beside her guest,
began to show them to her.  While she was doing this, the servants
closed all the doors of the suite of rooms, as well as that which
opened from the room outside--that of the well-hole into the avenue.
Suddenly, without any seeming cause, the light in the room began to
grow dim.  Sir Nathaniel, who was sitting close to Mimi, rose to his
feet, and, crying, ""Quick!"" caught hold of her hand and began to
drag her from the room.  Adam caught her other hand, and between
them they drew her through the outer door which the servants were
beginning to close.  It was difficult at first to find the way, the
darkness was so great; but to their relief when Adam whistled
shrilly, the carriage and horses, which had been waiting in the
angle of the avenue, dashed up.  Her husband and Sir Nathaniel
lifted--almost threw--Mimi into the carriage.  The postillion plied
whip and spur, and the vehicle, rocking with its speed, swept
through the gate and tore up the road.  Behind them was a hubbub--
servants rushing about, orders being shouted out, doors shutting,
and somewhere, seemingly far back in the house, a strange noise.
Every nerve of the horses was strained as they dashed recklessly
along the road.  The two men held Mimi between them, the arms of
both of them round her as though protectingly.  As they went, there
was a sudden rise in the ground; but the horses, breathing heavily,
dashed up it at racing speed, not slackening their pace when the
hill fell away again, leaving them to hurry along the downgrade.

It would be foolish to say that neither Adam nor Mimi had any fear
in returning to Doom Tower.  Mimi felt it more keenly than her
husband, whose nerves were harder, and who was more inured to
danger.  Still she bore up bravely, and as usual the effort was
helpful to her.  When once she was in the study in the top of the
turret, she almost forgot the terrors which lay outside in the dark.
She did not attempt to peep out of the window; but Adam did--and saw
nothing.  The moonlight showed all the surrounding country, but
nowhere was to be observed that tremulous line of green light.

The peaceful night had a good effect on them all; danger, being
unseen, seemed far off.  At times it was hard to realise that it had
ever been.  With courage restored, Adam rose early and walked along
the Brow, seeing no change in the signs of life in Castra Regis.
What he did see, to his wonder and concern, on his returning
homeward, was Lady Arabella, in her tight-fitting white dress and
ermine collar, but without her emeralds; she was emerging from the
gate of Diana's Grove and walking towards the Castle.  Pondering on
this and trying to find some meaning in it, occupied his thoughts
till he joined Mimi and Sir Nathaniel at breakfast.  They began the
meal in silence.  What had been had been, and was known to them all.
Moreover, it was not a pleasant topic.

A fillip was given to the conversation when Adam told of his seeing
Lady Arabella, on her way to Castra Regis.  They each had something
to say of her, and of what her wishes or intentions were towards
Edgar Caswall.  Mimi spoke bitterly of her in every aspect.  She had
not forgotten--and never would--never could--the occasion when, to
harm Lilla, the woman had consorted even with the nigger.  As a
social matter, she was disgusted with her for following up the rich
landowner--""throwing herself at his head so shamelessly,"" was how
she expressed it.  She was interested to know that the great kite
still flew from Caswall's tower.  But beyond such matters she did
not try to go.  The only comment she made was of strongly expressed
surprise at her ladyship's ""cheek"" in ignoring her own criminal
acts, and her impudence in taking it for granted that others had
overlooked them also.



CHAPTER XXIV--A STARTLING PROPOSITION



The more Mimi thought over the late events, the more puzzled she
was.  What did it all mean--what could it mean, except that there
was an error of fact somewhere.  Could it be possible that some of
them--all of them had been mistaken, that there had been no White
Worm at all?  On either side of her was a belief impossible of
reception.  Not to believe in what seemed apparent was to destroy
the very foundations of belief. . . yet in old days there had been
monsters on the earth, and certainly some people had believed in
just such mysterious changes of identity.  It was all very strange.
Just fancy how any stranger--say a doctor--would regard her, if she
were to tell him that she had been to a tea-party with an
antediluvian monster, and that they had been waited on by up-to-date
men-servants.

Adam had returned, exhilarated by his walk, and more settled in his
mind than he had been for some time.  Like Mimi, he had gone through
the phase of doubt and inability to believe in the reality of
things, though it had not affected him to the same extent.  The
idea, however, that his wife was suffering ill-effects from her
terrible ordeal, braced him up.  He remained with her for a time,
then he sought Sir Nathaniel in order to talk over the matter with
him.  He knew that the calm common sense and self-reliance of the
old man, as well as his experience, would be helpful to them all.

Sir Nathaniel had come to the conclusion that, for some reason which
he did not understand, Lady Arabella had changed her plans, and, for
the present at all events, was pacific.  He was inclined to
attribute her changed demeanour to the fact that her influence over
Edgar Caswall was so far increased, as to justify a more fixed
belief in his submission to her charms.

As a matter of fact, she had seen Caswall that morning when she
visited Castra Regis, and they had had a long talk together, during
which the possibility of their union had been discussed.  Caswall,
without being enthusiastic on the subject, had been courteous and
attentive; as she had walked back to Diana's Grove, she almost
congratulated herself on her new settlement in life.  That the idea
was becoming fixed in her mind, was shown by a letter which she
wrote later in the day to Adam Salton, and sent to him by hand.  It
ran as follows:


""DEAR MR. SALTON,

""I wonder if you would kindly advise, and, if possible, help me in a
matter of business.  I have been for some time trying to make up my
mind to sell Diana's Grove, I have put off and put off the doing of
it till now.  The place is my own property, and no one has to be
consulted with regard to what I may wish to do about it.  It was
bought by my late husband, Captain Adolphus Ranger March, who had
another residence, The Crest, Appleby.  He acquired all rights of
all kinds, including mining and sporting.  When he died, he left his
whole property to me.  I shall feel leaving this place, which has
become endeared to me by many sacred memories and affections--the
recollection of many happy days of my young married life, and the
more than happy memories of the man I loved and who loved me so
much.  I should be willing to sell the place for any fair price--so
long, of course, as the purchaser was one I liked and of whom I
approved.  May I say that you yourself would be the ideal person.
But I dare not hope for so much.  It strikes me, however, that among
your Australian friends may be someone who wishes to make a
settlement in the Old Country, and would care to fix the spot in one
of the most historic regions in England, full of romance and legend,
and with a never-ending vista of historical interest--an estate
which, though small, is in perfect condition and with illimitable
possibilities of development, and many doubtful--or unsettled--
rights which have existed before the time of the Romans or even
Celts, who were the original possessors.  In addition, the house has
been kept up to the DERNIER CRI.  Immediate possession can be
arranged.  My lawyers can provide you, or whoever you may suggest,
with all business and historical details.  A word from you of
acceptance or refusal is all that is necessary, and we can leave
details to be thrashed out by our agents.  Forgive me, won't you,
for troubling you in the matter, and believe me, yours very
sincerely.

""ARABELLA MARCH.""


Adam read this over several times, and then, his mind being made up,
he went to Mimi and asked if she had any objection.  She answered--
after a shudder--that she was, in this, as in all things, willing to
do whatever he might wish.

""Dearest, I am willing that you should judge what is best for us.
Be quite free to act as you see your duty, and as your inclination
calls.  We are in the hands of God, and He has hitherto guided us,
and will do so to His own end.""

From his wife's room Adam Salton went straight to the study in the
tower, where he knew Sir Nathaniel would be at that hour.  The old
man was alone, so, when he had entered in obedience to the ""Come
in,"" which answered his query, he closed the door and sat down
beside him.

""Do you think, sir, that it would be well for me to buy Diana's
Grove?""

""God bless my soul!"" said the old man, startled, ""why on earth would
you want to do that?""

""Well, I have vowed to destroy that White Worm, and my being able to
do whatever I may choose with the Lair would facilitate matters and
avoid complications.""

Sir Nathaniel hesitated longer than usual before speaking.  He was
thinking deeply.

""Yes, Adam, there is much common sense in your suggestion, though it
startled me at first.  I think that, for all reasons, you would do
well to buy the property and to have the conveyance settled at once.
If you want more money than is immediately convenient, let me know,
so that I may be your banker.""

""Thank you, sir, most heartily; but I have more money at immediate
call than I shall want.  I am glad you approve.""

""The property is historic, and as time goes on it will increase in
value.  Moreover, I may tell you something, which indeed is only a
surmise, but which, if I am right, will add great value to the
place.""  Adam listened.  ""Has it ever struck you why the old name,
'The Lair of the White Worm,' was given?  We know that there was a
snake which in early days was called a worm; but why white?""

""I really don't know, sir; I never thought of it.  I simply took it
for granted.""

""So did I at first--long ago.  But later I puzzled my brain for a
reason.""

""And what was the reason, sir?""

""Simply and solely because the snake or worm WAS white.  We are near
the county of Stafford, where the great industry of china-burning
was originated and grew.  Stafford owes much of its wealth to the
large deposits of the rare china clay found in it from time to time.
These deposits become in time pretty well exhausted; but for
centuries Stafford adventurers looked for the special clay, as Ohio
and Pennsylvania farmers and explorers looked for oil.  Anyone
owning real estate on which china clay can be discovered strikes a
sort of gold mine.""

""Yes, and then--""  The young man looked puzzled.

""The original 'Worm' so-called, from which the name of the place
came, had to find a direct way down to the marshes and the mud-
holes.  Now, the clay is easily penetrable, and the original hole
probably pierced a bed of china clay.  When once the way was made it
would become a sort of highway for the Worm.  But as much movement
was necessary to ascend such a great height, some of the clay would
become attached to its rough skin by attrition.  The downway must
have been easy work, but the ascent was different, and when the
monster came to view in the upper world, it would be fresh from
contact with the white clay.  Hence the name, which has no cryptic
significance, but only fact.  Now, if that surmise be true--and I do
not see why not--there must be a deposit of valuable clay--possibly
of immense depth.""

Adam's comment pleased the old gentleman.

""I have it in my bones, sir, that you have struck--or rather
reasoned out--a great truth.""

Sir Nathaniel went on cheerfully.  ""When the world of commerce wakes
up to the value of your find, it will be as well that your title to
ownership has been perfectly secured.  If anyone ever deserved such
a gain, it is you.""

With his friend's aid, Adam secured the property without loss of
time.  Then he went to see his uncle, and told him about it.  Mr.
Salton was delighted to find his young relative already
constructively the owner of so fine an estate--one which gave him an
important status in the county.  He made many anxious enquiries
about Mimi, and the doings of the White Worm, but Adam re-assured
him.

The next morning, when Adam went to his host in the smoking-room,
Sir Nathaniel asked him how he purposed to proceed with regard to
keeping his vow.

""It is a difficult matter which you have undertaken.  To destroy
such a monster is something like one of the labours of Hercules, in
that not only its size and weight and power of using them in little-
known ways are against you, but the occult side is alone an
unsurpassable difficulty.  The Worm is already master of all the
elements except fire--and I do not see how fire can be used for the
attack.  It has only to sink into the earth in its usual way, and
you could not overtake it if you had the resources of the biggest
coal-mine in existence.  But I daresay you have mapped out some plan
in your mind,"" he added courteously.

""I have, sir.  But, of course, it may not stand the test of
practice.""

""May I know the idea?""

""Well, sir, this was my argument:  At the time of the Chartist
trouble, an idea spread amongst financial circles that an attack was
going to be made on the Bank of England.  Accordingly, the directors
of that institution consulted many persons who were supposed to know
what steps should be taken, and it was finally decided that the best
protection against fire--which is what was feared--was not water but
sand.  To carry the scheme into practice great store of fine sea-
sand--the kind that blows about and is used to fill hour-glasses--
was provided throughout the building, especially at the points
liable to attack, from which it could be brought into use.

""I propose to provide at Diana's Grove, as soon as it comes into my
possession, an enormous amount of such sand, and shall take an early
occasion of pouring it into the well-hole, which it will in time
choke.  Thus Lady Arabella, in her guise of the White Worm, will
find herself cut off from her refuge.  The hole is a narrow one, and
is some hundreds of feet deep.  The weight of the sand this can
contain would not in itself be sufficient to obstruct; but the
friction of such a body working up against it would be tremendous.""

""One moment.  What use would the sand be for destruction?""

""None, directly; but it would hold the struggling body in place till
the rest of my scheme came into practice.""

""And what is the rest?""

""As the sand is being poured into the well-hole, quantities of
dynamite can also be thrown in!""

""Good.  But how would the dynamite explode--for, of course, that is
what you intend.  Would not some sort of wire or fuse he required
for each parcel of dynamite?""

Adam smiled.

""Not in these days, sir.  That was proved in New York.  A thousand
pounds of dynamite, in sealed canisters, was placed about some
workings.  At the last a charge of gunpowder was fired, and the
concussion exploded the dynamite.  It was most successful.  Those
who were non-experts in high explosives expected that every pane of
glass in New York would be shattered.  But, in reality, the
explosive did no harm outside the area intended, although sixteen
acres of rock had been mined and only the supporting walls and
pillars had been left intact.  The whole of the rocks were
shattered.""

Sir Nathaniel nodded approval.

""That seems a good plan--a very excellent one.  But if it has to
tear down so many feet of precipice, it may wreck the whole
neighbourhood.""

""And free it for ever from a monster,"" added Adam, as he left the
room to find his wife.



CHAPTER XXV--THE LAST BATTLE



Lady Arabella had instructed her solicitors to hurry on with the
conveyance of Diana's Grove, so no time was lost in letting Adam
Salton have formal possession of the estate.  After his interview
with Sir Nathaniel, he had taken steps to begin putting his plan
into action.  In order to accumulate the necessary amount of fine
sea-sand, he ordered the steward to prepare for an elaborate system
of top-dressing all the grounds.  A great heap of the sand, brought
from bays on the Welsh coast, began to grow at the back of the
Grove.  No one seemed to suspect that it was there for any purpose
other than what had been given out.

Lady Arabella, who alone could have guessed, was now so absorbed in
her matrimonial pursuit of Edgar Caswall, that she had neither time
nor inclination for thought extraneous to this.  She had not yet
moved from the house, though she had formally handed over the
estate.

Adam put up a rough corrugated-iron shed behind the Grove, in which
he stored his explosives.  All being ready for his great attempt
whenever the time should come, he was now content to wait, and, in
order to pass the time, interested himself in other things--even in
Caswall's great kite, which still flew from the high tower of Castra
Regis.

The mound of fine sand grew to proportions so vast as to puzzle the
bailiffs and farmers round the Brow.  The hour of the intended
cataclysm was approaching apace.  Adam wished--but in vain--for an
opportunity, which would appear to be natural, of visiting Caswall
in the turret of Castra Regis.  At last, one morning, he met Lady
Arabella moving towards the Castle, so he took his courage E DEUX
MAINS and asked to be allowed to accompany her.  She was glad, for
her own purposes, to comply with his wishes.  So together they
entered, and found their way to the turret-room.  Caswall was much
surprised to see Adam come to his house, but lent himself to the
task of seeming to be pleased.  He played the host so well as to
deceive even Adam.  They all went out on the turret roof, where he
explained to his guests the mechanism for raising and lowering the
kite, taking also the opportunity of testing the movements of the
multitudes of birds, how they answered almost instantaneously to the
lowering or raising of the kite.

As Lady Arabella walked home with Adam from Castra Regis, she asked
him if she might make a request.  Permission having been accorded,
she explained that before she finally left Diana's Grove, where she
had lived so long, she had a desire to know the depth of the well-
hole.  Adam was really happy to meet her wishes, not from any
sentiment, but because he wished to give some valid and ostensible
reason for examining the passage of the Worm, which would obviate
any suspicion resulting from his being on the premises.  He brought
from London a Kelvin sounding apparatus, with a sufficient length of
piano-wire for testing any probable depth.  The wire passed easily
over the running wheel, and when this was once fixed over the hole,
he was satisfied to wait till the most advantageous time for his
final experiment.


In the meantime, affairs had been going quietly at Mercy Farm.
Lilla, of course, felt lonely in the absence of her cousin, but the
even tenor of life went on for her as for others.  After the first
shock of parting was over, things went back to their accustomed
routine.  In one respect, however, there was a marked difference.
So long as home conditions had remained unchanged, Lilla was content
to put ambition far from her, and to settle down to the life which
had been hers as long as she could remember.  But Mimi's marriage
set her thinking; naturally, she came to the conclusion that she too
might have a mate.  There was not for her much choice--there was
little movement in the matrimonial direction at the farmhouse.  She
did not approve of the personality of Edgar Caswall, and his
struggle with Mimi had frightened her; but he was unmistakably an
excellent PARTI, much better than she could have any right to
expect.  This weighs much with a woman, and more particularly one of
her class.  So, on the whole, she was content to let things take
their course, and to abide by the issue.

As time went on, she had reason to believe that things did not point
to happiness.  She could not shut her eyes to certain disturbing
facts, amongst which were the existence of Lady Arabella and her
growing intimacy with Edgar Caswall; as well as his own cold and
haughty nature, so little in accord with the ardour which is the
foundation of a young maid's dreams of happiness.  How things would,
of necessity, alter if she were to marry, she was afraid to think.
All told, the prospect was not happy for her, and she had a secret
longing that something might occur to upset the order of things as
at present arranged.

When Lilla received a note from Edgar Caswall asking if he might
come to tea on the following afternoon, her heart sank within her.
If it was only for her father's sake, she must not refuse him or
show any disinclination which he might construe into incivility.
She missed Mimi more than she could say or even dared to think.
Hitherto, she had always looked to her cousin for sympathy, for
understanding, for loyal support.  Now she and all these things, and
a thousand others--gentle, assuring, supporting--were gone.  And
instead there was a horrible aching void.

For the whole afternoon and evening, and for the following forenoon,
poor Lilla's loneliness grew to be a positive agony.  For the first
time she began to realise the sense of her loss, as though all the
previous suffering had been merely a preparation.  Everything she
looked at, everything she remembered or thought of, became laden
with poignant memory.  Then on the top of all was a new sense of
dread.  The reaction from the sense of security, which had
surrounded her all her life, to a never-quieted apprehension, was at
times almost more than she could bear.  It so filled her with fear
that she had a haunting feeling that she would as soon die as live.
However, whatever might be her own feelings, duty had to be done,
and as she had been brought up to consider duty first, she braced
herself to go through, to the very best of her ability, what was
before her.

Still, the severe and prolonged struggle for self-control told upon
Lilla.  She looked, as she felt, ill and weak.  She was really in a
nerveless and prostrate condition, with black circles round her
eyes, pale even to her lips, and with an instinctive trembling which
she was quite unable to repress.  It was for her a sad mischance
that Mimi was away, for her love would have seen through all
obscuring causes, and have brought to light the girl's unhappy
condition of health.  Lilla was utterly unable to do anything to
escape from the ordeal before her; but her cousin, with the
experience of her former struggles with Mr. Caswall and of the
condition in which these left her, would have taken steps--even
peremptory ones, if necessary--to prevent a repetition.

Edgar arrived punctually to the time appointed by herself.  When
Lilla, through the great window, saw him approaching the house, her
condition of nervous upset was pitiable.  She braced herself up,
however, and managed to get through the interview in its preliminary
stages without any perceptible change in her normal appearance and
bearing.  It had been to her an added terror that the black shadow
of Oolanga, whom she dreaded, would follow hard on his master.  A
load was lifted from her mind when he did not make his usual
stealthy approach.  She had also feared, though in lesser degree,
lest Lady Arabella should be present to make trouble for her as
before.

With a woman's natural forethought in a difficult position, she had
provided the furnishing of the tea-table as a subtle indication of
the social difference between her and her guest.  She had chosen the
implements of service, as well as all the provender set forth, of
the humblest kind.  Instead of arranging the silver teapot and china
cups, she had set out an earthen tea-pot, such as was in common use
in the farm kitchen.  The same idea was carried out in the cups and
saucers of thick homely delft, and in the cream-jug of similar kind.
The bread was of simple whole-meal, home-baked.  The butter was
good, since she had made it herself, while the preserves and honey
came from her own garden.  Her face beamed with satisfaction when
the guest eyed the appointments with a supercilious glance.  It was
a shock to the poor girl herself, for she enjoyed offering to a
guest the little hospitalities possible to her; but that had to be
sacrificed with other pleasures.

Caswall's face was more set and iron-clad than ever--his piercing
eyes seemed from the very beginning to look her through and through.
Her heart quailed when she thought of what would follow--of what
would be the end, when this was only the beginning.  As some
protection, though it could be only of a sentimental kind, she
brought from her own room the photographs of Mimi, of her
grandfather, and of Adam Salton, whom by now she had grown to look
on with reliance, as a brother whom she could trust.  She kept the
pictures near her heart, to which her hand naturally strayed when
her feelings of constraint, distrust, or fear became so poignant as
to interfere with the calm which she felt was necessary to help her
through her ordeal.

At first Edgar Caswall was courteous and polite, even thoughtful;
but after a little while, when he found her resistance to his
domination grow, he abandoned all forms of self-control and appeared
in the same dominance as he had previously shown.  She was prepared,
however, for this, both by her former experience and the natural
fighting instinct within her.  By this means, as the minutes went
on, both developed the power and preserved the equality in which
they had begun.

Without warning, the psychic battle between the two individualities
began afresh.  This time both the positive and negative causes were
all in favour of the man.  The woman was alone and in bad spirits,
unsupported; nothing at all was in her favour except the memory of
the two victorious contests; whereas the man, though unaided, as
before, by either Lady Arabella or Oolanga, was in full strength,
well rested, and in flourishing circumstances.  It was not,
therefore, to be wondered at that his native dominance of character
had full opportunity of asserting itself.  He began his preliminary
stare with a conscious sense of power, and, as it appeared to have
immediate effect on the girl, he felt an ever-growing conviction of
ultimate victory.

After a little Lilla's resolution began to flag.  She felt that the
contest was unequal--that she was unable to put forth her best
efforts.  As she was an unselfish person, she could not fight so
well in her own battle as in that of someone whom she loved and to
whom she was devoted.  Edgar saw the relaxing of the muscles of face
and brow, and the almost collapse of the heavy eyelids which seemed
tumbling downward in sleep.  Lilla made gallant efforts to brace her
dwindling powers, but for a time unsuccessfully.  At length there
came an interruption, which seemed like a powerful stimulant.
Through the wide window she saw Lady Arabella enter the plain
gateway of the farm, and advance towards the hall door.  She was
clad as usual in tight-fitting white, which accentuated her thin,
sinuous figure.

The sight did for Lilla what no voluntary effort could have done.
Her eyes flashed, and in an instant she felt as though a new life
had suddenly developed within her.  Lady Arabella's entry, in her
usual unconcerned, haughty, supercilious way, heightened the effect,
so that when the two stood close to each other battle was joined.
Mr. Caswall, too, took new courage from her coming, and all his
masterfulness and power came back to him.  His looks, intensified,
had more obvious effect than had been noticeable that day.  Lilla
seemed at last overcome by his dominance.  Her face became red and
pale--violently red and ghastly pale--by rapid turns.  Her strength
seemed gone.  Her knees collapsed, and she was actually sinking on
the floor, when to her surprise and joy Mimi came into the room,
running hurriedly and breathing heavily.

Lilla rushed to her, and the two clasped hands.  With that, a new
sense of power, greater than Lilla had ever seen in her, seemed to
quicken her cousin.  Her hand swept the air in front of Edgar
Caswall, seeming to drive him backward more and more by each
movement, till at last he seemed to be actually hurled through the
door which Mimi's entrance had left open, and fell at full length on
the gravel path without.

Then came the final and complete collapse of Lilla, who, without a
sound, sank down on the floor.



CHAPTER XXVI--FACE TO FACE



Mimi was greatly distressed when she saw her cousin lying prone.
She had a few times in her life seen Lilla on the verge of fainting,
but never senseless; and now she was frightened.  She threw herself
on her knees beside Lilla, and tried, by rubbing her hands and other
measures commonly known, to restore her.  But all her efforts were
unavailing.  Lilla still lay white and senseless.  In fact, each
moment she looked worse; her breast, that had been heaving with the
stress, became still, and the pallor of her face grew like marble.

At these succeeding changes Mimi's fright grew, till it altogether
mastered her.  She succeeded in controlling herself only to the
extent that she did not scream.

Lady Arabella had followed Caswall, when he had recovered
sufficiently to get up and walk--though stumblingly--in the
direction of Castra Regis.  When Mimi was quite alone with Lilla and
the need for effort had ceased, she felt weak and trembled.  In her
own mind, she attributed it to a sudden change in the weather--it
was momentarily becoming apparent that a storm was coming on.

She raised Lilla's head and laid it on her warm young breast, but
all in vain.  The cold of the white features thrilled through her,
and she utterly collapsed when it was borne in on her that Lilla had
passed away.

The dusk gradually deepened and the shades of evening closed in, but
Mimi did not seem to notice or to care.  She sat on the floor with
her arms round the body of the girl whom she loved.  Darker and
blacker grew the sky as the coming storm and the closing night
joined forces.  Still she sat on--alone--tearless--unable to think.
Mimi did not know how long she sat there.  Though it seemed to her
that ages had passed, it could not have been more than half-an-hour.
She suddenly came to herself, and was surprised to find that her
grandfather had not returned.  For a while she lay quiet, thinking
of the immediate past.  Lilla's hand was still in hers, and to her
surprise it was still warm.  Somehow this helped her consciousness,
and without any special act of will she stood up.  She lit a lamp
and looked at her cousin.  There was no doubt that Lilla was dead;
but when the lamp-light fell on her eyes, they seemed to look at
Mimi with intent--with meaning.  In this state of dark isolation a
new resolution came to her, and grew and grew until it became a
fixed definite purpose.  She would face Caswall and call him to
account for his murder of Lilla--that was what she called it to
herself.  She would also take steps--she knew not what or how--to
avenge the part taken by Lady Arabella.

In this frame of mind she lit all the lamps in the room, got water
and linen from her room, and set about the decent ordering of
Lilla's body.  This took some time; but when it was finished, she
put on her hat and cloak, put out the lights, and set out quietly
for Castra Regis.

As Mimi drew near the Castle, she saw no lights except those in and
around the tower room.  The lights showed her that Mr. Caswall was
there, so she entered by the hall door, which as usual was open, and
felt her way in the darkness up the staircase to the lobby of the
room.  The door was ajar, and the light from within showed
brilliantly through the opening.  She saw Edgar Caswall walking
restlessly to and fro in the room, with his hands clasped behind his
back.  She opened the door without knocking, and walked right into
the room.  As she entered, he ceased walking, and stared at her in
surprise.  She made no remark, no comment, but continued the fixed
look which he had seen on her entrance.

For a time silence reigned, and the two stood looking fixedly at
each other.  Mimi was the first to speak.

""You murderer!  Lilla is dead!""

""Dead!  Good God!  When did she die?""

""She died this afternoon, just after you left her.""

""Are you sure?""

""Yes--and so are you--or you ought to be.  You killed her!""

""I killed her!  Be careful what you say!""

""As God sees us, it is true; and you know it.  You came to Mercy
Farm on purpose to break her--if you could.  And the accomplice of
your guilt, Lady Arabella March, came for the same purpose.""

""Be careful, woman,"" he said hotly.  ""Do not use such names in that
way, or you shall suffer for it.""

""I am suffering for it--have suffered for it--shall suffer for it.
Not for speaking the truth as I have done, but because you two, with
devilish malignity, did my darling to death.  It is you and your
accomplice who have to dread punishment, not I.""

""Take care!"" he said again.

""Oh, I am not afraid of you or your accomplice,"" she answered
spiritedly.  ""I am content to stand by every word I have said, every
act I have done.  Moreover, I believe in God's justice.  I fear not
the grinding of His mills; if necessary I shall set the wheels in
motion myself.  But you don't care for God, or believe in Him.  Your
god is your great kite, which cows the birds of a whole district.
But be sure that His hand, when it rises, always falls at the
appointed time.  It may be that your name is being called even at
this very moment at the Great Assize.  Repent while there is still
time.  Happy you, if you may be allowed to enter those mighty halls
in the company of the pure-souled angel whose voice has only to
whisper one word of justice, and you disappear for ever into
everlasting torment.""

The sudden death of Lilla caused consternation among Mimi's friends
and well-wishers.  Such a tragedy was totally unexpected, as Adam
and Sir Nathaniel had been expecting the White Worm's vengeance to
fall upon themselves.

Adam, leaving his wife free to follow her own desires with regard to
Lilla and her grandfather, busied himself with filling the well-hole
with the fine sand prepared for the purpose, taking care to have
lowered at stated intervals quantities of the store of dynamite, so
as to be ready for the final explosion.  He had under his immediate
supervision a corps of workmen, and was assisted by Sir Nathaniel,
who had come over for the purpose, and all were now staying at
Lesser Hill.

Mr. Salton, too, showed much interest in the job, and was constantly
coming in and out, nothing escaping his observation.

Since her marriage to Adam and their coming to stay at Doom Tower,
Mimi had been fettered by fear of the horrible monster at Diana's
Grove.  But now she dreaded it no longer.  She accepted the fact of
its assuming at will the form of Lady Arabella.  She had still to
tax and upbraid her for her part in the unhappiness which had been
wrought on Lilla, and for her share in causing her death.

One evening, when Mimi entered her own room, she went to the window
and threw an eager look round the whole circle of sight.  A single
glance satisfied her that the White Worm in PROPRIA PERSONA was not
visible.  So she sat down in the window-seat and enjoyed the
pleasure of a full view, from which she had been so long cut off.
The maid who waited on her had told her that Mr. Salton had not yet
returned home, so she felt free to enjoy the luxury of peace and
quiet.

As she looked out of the window, she saw something thin and white
move along the avenue.  She thought she recognised the figure of
Lady Arabella, and instinctively drew back behind the curtain.  When
she had ascertained, by peeping out several times, that the lady had
not seen her, she watched more carefully, all her instinctive hatred
flooding back at the sight of her.  Lady Arabella was moving swiftly
and stealthily, looking back and around her at intervals, as if she
feared to be followed.  This gave Mimi an idea that she was up to no
good, so she determined to seize the occasion for watching her in
more detail.

Hastily putting on a dark cloak and hat, she ran downstairs and out
into the avenue.  Lady Arabella had moved, but the sheen of her
white dress was still to be seen among the young oaks around the
gateway.  Keeping in shadow, Mimi followed, taking care not to come
so close as to awake the other's suspicion, and watched her quarry
pass along the road in the direction of Castra Regis.

She followed on steadily through the gloom of the trees, depending
on the glint of the white dress to keep her right.  The wood began
to thicken, and presently, when the road widened and the trees grew
farther back, she lost sight of any indication of her whereabouts.
Under the present conditions it was impossible for her to do any
more, so, after waiting for a while, still hidden in the shadow to
see if she could catch another glimpse of the white frock, she
determined to go on slowly towards Castra Regis, and trust to the
chapter of accidents to pick up the trail again.  She went on
slowly, taking advantage of every obstacle and shadow to keep
herself concealed.

At last she entered on the grounds of the Castle, at a spot from
which the windows of the turret were dimly visible, without having
seen again any sign of Lady Arabella.

Meanwhile, during most of the time that Mimi Salton had been moving
warily along in the gloom, she was in reality being followed by Lady
Arabella, who had caught sight of her leaving the house and had
never again lost touch with her.  It was a case of the hunter being
hunted.  For a time Mimi's many turnings, with the natural obstacles
that were perpetually intervening, caused Lady Arabella some
trouble; but when she was close to Castra Regis, there was no more
possibility of concealment, and the strange double following went
swiftly on.

When she saw Mimi close to the hall door of Castra Regis and
ascending the steps, she followed.  When Mimi entered the dark hall
and felt her way up the staircase, still, as she believed, following
Lady Arabella, the latter kept on her way.  When they reached the
lobby of the turret-rooms, Mimi believed that the object of her
search was ahead of her.

Edgar Caswall sat in the gloom of the great room, occasionally
stirred to curiosity when the drifting clouds allowed a little light
to fall from the storm-swept sky.  But nothing really interested him
now.  Since he had heard of Lilla's death, the gloom of his remorse,
emphasised by Mimi's upbraiding, had made more hopeless his cruel,
selfish, saturnine nature.  He heard no sound, for his normal
faculties seemed benumbed.

Mimi, when she came to the door, which stood ajar, gave a light tap.
So light was it that it did not reach Caswall's ears.  Then, taking
her courage in both hands, she boldly pushed the door and entered.
As she did so, her heart sank, for now she was face to face with a
difficulty which had not, in her state of mental perturbation,
occurred to her.



CHAPTER XXVII--ON THE TURRET ROOF



The storm which was coming was already making itself manifest, not
only in the wide scope of nature, but in the hearts and natures of
human beings.  Electrical disturbance in the sky and the air is
reproduced in animals of all kinds, and particularly in the highest
type of them all--the most receptive--the most electrical.  So it
was with Edgar Caswall, despite his selfish nature and coldness of
blood.  So it was with Mimi Salton, despite her unselfish,
unchanging devotion for those she loved.  So it was even with Lady
Arabella, who, under the instincts of a primeval serpent, carried
the ever-varying wishes and customs of womanhood, which is always
old--and always new.

Edgar, after he had turned his eyes on Mimi, resumed his apathetic
position and sullen silence.  Mimi quietly took a seat a little way
apart, whence she could look on the progress of the coming storm and
study its appearance throughout the whole visible circle of the
neighbourhood.  She was in brighter and better spirits than she had
been for many days past.  Lady Arabella tried to efface herself
behind the now open door.

Without, the clouds grew thicker and blacker as the storm-centre
came closer.  As yet the forces, from whose linking the lightning
springs, were held apart, and the silence of nature proclaimed the
calm before the storm.  Caswall felt the effect of the gathering
electric force.  A sort of wild exultation grew upon him, such as he
had sometimes felt just before the breaking of a tropical storm.  As
he became conscious of this, he raised his head and caught sight of
Mimi.  He was in the grip of an emotion greater than himself; in the
mood in which he was he felt the need upon him of doing some
desperate deed.  He was now absolutely reckless, and as Mimi was
associated with him in the memory which drove him on, he wished that
she too should be engaged in this enterprise.  He had no knowledge
of the proximity of Lady Arabella, and thought that he was far
removed from all he knew and whose interests he shared--alone with
the wild elements, which were being lashed to fury, and with the
woman who had struggled with him and vanquished him, and on whom he
would shower the full measure of his hate.

The fact was that Edgar Caswall was, if not mad, close to the
border-line.  Madness in its first stage--monomania--is a lack of
proportion.  So long as this is general, it is not always
noticeable, for the uninspired onlooker is without the necessary
means of comparison.  But in monomania the errant faculty protrudes
itself in a way that may not be denied.  It puts aside, obscures, or
takes the place of something else--just as the head of a pin placed
before the centre of the iris will block out the whole scope of
vision.  The most usual form of monomania has commonly the same
beginning as that from which Edgar Caswall suffered--an over-large
idea of self-importance.  Alienists, who study the matter exactly,
probably know more of human vanity and its effects than do ordinary
men.  Caswall's mental disturbance was not hard to identify.  Every
asylum is full of such cases--men and women, who, naturally selfish
and egotistical, so appraise to themselves their own importance that
every other circumstance in life becomes subservient to it.  The
disease supplies in itself the material for self-magnification.
When the decadence attacks a nature naturally proud and selfish and
vain, and lacking both the aptitude and habit of self-restraint, the
development of the disease is more swift, and ranges to farther
limits.  It is such persons who become inbued with the idea that
they have the attributes of the Almighty--even that they themselves
are the Almighty.

Mimi had a suspicion--or rather, perhaps, an intuition--of the true
state of things when she heard him speak, and at the same time
noticed the abnormal flush on his face, and his rolling eyes.  There
was a certain want of fixedness of purpose which she had certainly
not noticed before--a quick, spasmodic utterance which belongs
rather to the insane than to those of intellectual equilibrium.  She
was a little frightened, not only by his thoughts, but by his
staccato way of expressing them.

Caswall moved to the door leading to the turret stair by which the
roof was reached, and spoke in a peremptory way, whose tone alone
made her feel defiant.

""Come!  I want you.""

She instinctively drew back--she was not accustomed to such words,
more especially to such a tone.  Her answer was indicative of a new
contest.

""Why should I go?  What for?""

He did not at once reply--another indication of his overwhelming
egotism.  She repeated her questions; habit reasserted itself, and
he spoke without thinking the words which were in his heart.

""I want you, if you will be so good, to come with me to the turret
roof.  I am much interested in certain experiments with the kite,
which would be, if not a pleasure, at least a novel experience to
you.  You would see something not easily seen otherwise.""

""I will come,"" she answered simply; Edgar moved in the direction of
the stair, she following close behind him.

She did not like to be left alone at such a height, in such a place,
in the darkness, with a storm about to break.  Of himself she had no
fear; all that had been seemed to have passed away with her two
victories over him in the struggle of wills.  Moreover, the more
recent apprehension--that of his madness--had also ceased.  In the
conversation of the last few minutes he seemed so rational, so
clear, so unaggressive, that she no longer saw reason for doubt.  So
satisfied was she that even when he put out a hand to guide her to
the steep, narrow stairway, she took it without thought in the most
conventional way.

Lady Arabella, crouching in the lobby behind the door, heard every
word that had been said, and formed her own opinion of it.  It
seemed evident to her that there had been some rapprochement between
the two who had so lately been hostile to each other, and that made
her furiously angry.  Mimi was interfering with her plans!  She had
made certain of her capture of Edgar Caswall, and she could not
tolerate even the lightest and most contemptuous fancy on his part
which might divert him from the main issue.  When she became aware
that he wished Mimi to come with him to the roof and that she had
acquiesced, her rage got beyond bounds.  She became oblivious to any
danger there might be in a visit to such an exposed place at such a
time, and to all lesser considerations, and made up her mind to
forestall them.  She stealthily and noiselessly crept through the
wicket, and, ascending the stair, stepped out on the roof.  It was
bitterly cold, for the fierce gusts of the storm which swept round
the turret drove in through every unimpeded way, whistling at the
sharp corners and singing round the trembling flagstaff.  The kite-
string and the wire which controlled the runners made a concourse of
weird sounds which somehow, perhaps from the violence which
surrounded them, acting on their length, resolved themselves into
some kind of harmony--a fitting accompaniment to the tragedy which
seemed about to begin.

Mimi's heart beat heavily.  Just before leaving the turret-chamber
she had a shock which she could not shake off.  The lights of the
room had momentarily revealed to her, as they passed out, Edgar's
face, concentrated as it was whenever he intended to use his
mesmeric power.  Now the black eyebrows made a thick line across his
face, under which his eyes shone and glittered ominously.  Mimi
recognised the danger, and assumed the defiant attitude that had
twice already served her so well.  She had a fear that the
circumstances and the place were against her, and she wanted to be
forearmed.

The sky was now somewhat lighter than it had been.  Either there was
lightning afar off, whose reflections were carried by the rolling
clouds, or else the gathered force, though not yet breaking into
lightning, had an incipient power of light.  It seemed to affect
both the man and the woman.  Edgar seemed altogether under its
influence.  His spirits were boisterous, his mind exalted.  He was
now at his worst; madder than he had been earlier in the night.

Mimi, trying to keep as far from him as possible, moved across the
stone floor of the turret roof, and found a niche which concealed
her.  It was not far from Lady Arabella's place of hiding.

Edgar, left thus alone on the centre of the turret roof, found
himself altogether his own master in a way which tended to increase
his madness.  He knew that Mimi was close at hand, though he had
lost sight of her.  He spoke loudly, and the sound of his own voice,
though it was carried from him on the sweeping wind as fast as the
words were spoken, seemed to exalt him still more.  Even the raging
of the elements round him appeared to add to his exaltation.  To him
it seemed that these manifestations were obedient to his own will.
He had reached the sublime of his madness; he was now in his own
mind actually the Almighty, and whatever might happen would be the
direct carrying out of his own commands.  As he could not see Mimi,
nor fix whereabout she was, he shouted loudly:

""Come to me!  You shall see now what you are despising, what you are
warring against.  All that you see is mine--the darkness as well as
the light.  I tell you that I am greater than any other who is, or
was, or shall be.  When the Master of Evil took Christ up on a high
place and showed Him all the kingdoms of the earth, he was doing
what he thought no other could do.  He was wrong--he forgot ME.  I
shall send you light, up to the very ramparts of heaven.  A light so
great that it shall dissipate those black clouds that are rushing up
and piling around us.  Look!  Look!  At the very touch of my hand
that light springs into being and mounts up--and up--and up!""

He made his way whilst he was speaking to the corner of the turret
whence flew the giant kite, and from which the runners ascended.
Mimi looked on, appalled and afraid to speak lest she should
precipitate some calamity.  Within the niche Lady Arabella cowered
in a paroxysm of fear.

Edgar took up a small wooden box, through a hole in which the wire
of the runner ran.  This evidently set some machinery in motion, for
a sound as of whirring came.  From one side of the box floated what
looked like a piece of stiff ribbon, which snapped and crackled as
the wind took it.  For a few seconds Mimi saw it as it rushed along
the sagging line to the kite.  When close to it, there was a loud
crack, and a sudden light appeared to issue from every chink in the
box.  Then a quick flame flashed along the snapping ribbon, which
glowed with an intense light--a light so great that the whole of the
countryside around stood out against the background of black driving
clouds.  For a few seconds the light remained, then suddenly
disappeared in the blackness around.  It was simply a magnesium
light, which had been fired by the mechanism within the box and
carried up to the kite.  Edgar was in a state of tumultuous
excitement, shouting and yelling at the top of his voice and dancing
about like a lunatic.

This was more than Lady Arabella's curious dual nature could stand--
the ghoulish element in her rose triumphant, and she abandoned all
idea of marriage with Edgar Caswall, gloating fiendishly over the
thought of revenge.

She must lure him to the White Worm's hole--but how?  She glanced
around and quickly made up her mind.  The man's whole thoughts were
absorbed by his wonderful kite, which he was showing off, in order
to fascinate her imaginary rival, Mimi.

On the instant she glided through the darkness to the wheel whereon
the string of the kite was wound.  With deft fingers she unshipped
this, took it with her, reeling out the wire as she went, thus
keeping, in a way, in touch with the kite.  Then she glided swiftly
to the wicket, through which she passed, locking the gate behind her
as she went.

Down the turret stair she ran quickly, letting the wire run from the
wheel which she carried carefully, and, passing out of the hall
door, hurried down the avenue with all her speed.  She soon reached
her own gate, ran down the avenue, and with her key opened the iron
door leading to the well-hole.

She felt well satisfied with herself.  All her plans were maturing,
or had already matured.  The Master of Castra Regis was within her
grasp.  The woman whose interference she had feared, Lilla Watford,
was dead.  Truly, all was well, and she felt that she might pause a
while and rest.  She tore off her clothes, with feverish fingers,
and in full enjoyment of her natural freedom, stretched her slim
figure in animal delight.  Then she lay down on the sofa--to await
her victim!  Edgar Caswall's life blood would more than satisfy her
for some time to come.



CHAPTER XXVIII--THE BREAKING OF THE STORM



When Lady Arabella had crept away in her usual noiseless fashion,
the two others remained for a while in their places on the turret
roof:  Caswall because he had nothing to say, Mimi because she had
much to say and wished to put her thoughts in order.  For quite a
while--which seemed interminable--silence reigned between them.  At
last Mimi made a beginning--she had made up her mind how to act.

""Mr. Caswall,"" she said loudly, so as to make sure of being heard
through the blustering of the wind and the perpetual cracking of the
electricity.

Caswall said something in reply, but his words were carried away on
the storm.  However, one of her objects was effected:  she knew now
exactly whereabout on the roof he was.  So she moved close to the
spot before she spoke again, raising her voice almost to a shout.

""The wicket is shut.  Please to open it.  I can't get out.""

As she spoke, she was quietly fingering a revolver which Adam had
given to her in case of emergency and which now lay in her breast.
She felt that she was caged like a rat in a trap, but did not mean
to be taken at a disadvantage, whatever happened.  Caswall also felt
trapped, and all the brute in him rose to the emergency.  In a voice
which was raucous and brutal--much like that which is heard when a
wife is being beaten by her husband in a slum--he hissed out, his
syllables cutting through the roaring of the storm:

""You came of your own accord--without permission, or even asking it.
Now you can stay or go as you choose.  But you must manage it for
yourself; I'll have nothing to do with it.""

Her answer was spoken with dangerous suavity

""I am going.  Blame yourself if you do not like the time and manner
of it.  I daresay Adam--my husband--will have a word to say to you
about it!""

""Let him say, and be damned to him, and to you too!  I'll show you a
light.  You shan't be able to say that you could not see what you
were doing.""

As he spoke, he was lighting another piece of the magnesium ribbon,
which made a blinding glare in which everything was plainly
discernible, down to the smallest detail.  This exactly suited Mimi.
She took accurate note of the wicket and its fastening before the
glare had died away.  She took her revolver out and fired into the
lock, which was shivered on the instant, the pieces flying round in
all directions, but happily without causing hurt to anyone.  Then
she pushed the wicket open and ran down the narrow stair, and so to
the hall door.  Opening this also, she ran down the avenue, never
lessening her speed till she stood outside the door of Lesser Hill.
The door was opened at once on her ringing.

""Is Mr. Adam Salton in?"" she asked.

""He has just come in, a few minutes ago.  He has gone up to the
study,"" replied a servant.

She ran upstairs at once and joined him.  He seemed relieved when he
saw her, but scrutinised her face keenly.  He saw that she had been
in some concern, so led her over to the sofa in the window and sat
down beside her.

""Now, dear, tell me all about it!"" he said.

She rushed breathlessly through all the details of her adventure on
the turret roof.  Adam listened attentively, helping her all he
could, and not embarrassing her by any questioning.  His thoughtful
silence was a great help to her, for it allowed her to collect and
organise her thoughts.

""I must go and see Caswall to-morrow, to hear what he has to say on
the subject.""

""But, dear, for my sake, don't have any quarrel with Mr. Caswall.  I
have had too much trial and pain lately to wish it increased by any
anxiety regarding you.""

""You shall not, dear--if I can help it--please God,"" he said
solemnly, and he kissed her.

Then, in order to keep her interested so that she might forget the
fears and anxieties that had disturbed her, he began to talk over
the details of her adventure, making shrewd comments which attracted
and held her attention.  Presently, INTER ALIA, he said:

""That's a dangerous game Caswall is up to.  It seems to me that that
young man--though he doesn't appear to know it--is riding for a
fall!""

""How, dear?  I don't understand.""

""Kite flying on a night like this from a place like the tower of
Castra Regis is, to say the least of it, dangerous.  It is not
merely courting death or other accident from lightning, but it is
bringing the lightning into where he lives.  Every cloud that is
blowing up here--and they all make for the highest point--is bound
to develop into a flash of lightning.  That kite is up in the air
and is bound to attract the lightning.  Its cord makes a road for it
on which to travel to earth.  When it does come, it will strike the
top of the tower with a weight a hundred times greater than a whole
park of artillery, and will knock Castra Regis into pieces.  Where
it will go after that, no one can tell.  If there should be any
metal by which it can travel, such will not only point the road, but
be the road itself.""

""Would it be dangerous to be out in the open air when such a thing
is taking place?"" she asked.

""No, little woman.  It would be the safest possible place--so long
as one was not in the line of the electric current.""

""Then, do let us go outside.  I don't want to run into any foolish
danger--or, far more, to ask you to do so.  But surely if the open
is safest, that is the place for us.""

Without another word, she put on again the cloak she had thrown off,
and a small, tight-fitting cap.  Adam too put on his cap, and, after
seeing that his revolver was all right, gave her his hand, and they
left the house together.

""I think the best thing we can do will be to go round all the places
which are mixed up in this affair.""

""All right, dear, I am ready.  But, if you don't mind, we might go
first to Mercy.  I am anxious about grandfather, and we might see
that--as yet, at all events--nothing has happened there.""

So they went on the high-hung road along the top of the Brow.  The
wind here was of great force, and made a strange booming noise as it
swept high overhead; though not the sound of cracking and tearing as
it passed through the woods of high slender trees which grew on
either side of the road.  Mimi could hardly keep her feet.  She was
not afraid; but the force to which she was opposed gave her a good
excuse to hold on to her husband extra tight.

At Mercy there was no one up--at least, all the lights were out.
But to Mimi, accustomed to the nightly routine of the house, there
were manifest signs that all was well, except in the little room on
the first floor, where the blinds were down.  Mimi could not bear to
look at that, to think of it.  Adam understood her pain, for he had
been keenly interested in poor Lilla.  He bent over and kissed her,
and then took her hand and held it hard.  Thus they passed on
together, returning to the high road towards Castra Regis.

At the gate of Castra Regis they were extra careful.  When drawing
near, Adam stumbled upon the wire that Lady Arabella had left
trailing on the ground.

Adam drew his breath at this, and spoke in a low, earnest whisper:

""I don't want to frighten you, Mimi dear, but wherever that wire is
there is danger.""

""Danger!  How?""

""That is the track where the lightning will go; at any moment, even
now whilst we are speaking and searching, a fearful force may be
loosed upon us.  Run on, dear; you know the way to where the avenue
joins the highroad.  If you see any sign of the wire, keep away from
it, for God's sake.  I shall join you at the gateway.""

""Are you going to follow that wire alone?""

""Yes, dear.  One is sufficient for that work.  I shall not lose a
moment till I am with you.""

""Adam, when I came with you into the open, my main wish was that we
should be together if anything serious happened.  You wouldn't deny
me that right, would you, dear?""

""No, dear, not that or any right.  Thank God that my wife has such a
wish.  Come; we will go together.  We are in the hands of God.  If
He wishes, we shall be together at the end, whenever or wherever
that may be.""

They picked up the trail of the wire on the steps and followed it
down the avenue, taking care not to touch it with their feet.  It
was easy enough to follow, for the wire, if not bright, was self-
coloured, and showed clearly.  They followed it out of the gateway
and into the avenue of Diana's Grove.

Here a new gravity clouded Adam's face, though Mimi saw no cause for
fresh concern.  This was easily enough explained.  Adam knew of the
explosive works in progress regarding the well-hole, but the matter
had been kept from his wife.  As they stood near the house, Adam
asked Mimi to return to the road, ostensibly to watch the course of
the wire, telling her that there might be a branch wire leading
somewhere else.  She was to search the undergrowth, and if she found
it, was to warn him by the Australian native ""Coo-ee!""

Whilst they were standing together, there came a blinding flash of
lightning, which lit up for several seconds the whole area of earth
and sky.  It was only the first note of the celestial prelude, for
it was followed in quick succession by numerous flashes, whilst the
crash and roll of thunder seemed continuous.

Adam, appalled, drew his wife to him and held her close.  As far as
he could estimate by the interval between lightning and thunder-
clap, the heart of the storm was still some distance off, so he felt
no present concern for their safety.  Still, it was apparent that
the course of the storm was moving swiftly in their direction.  The
lightning flashes came faster and faster and closer together; the
thunder-roll was almost continuous, not stopping for a moment--a new
crash beginning before the old one had ceased.  Adam kept looking up
in the direction where the kite strained and struggled at its
detaining cord, but, of course, the dull evening light prevented any
distinct scrutiny.

At length there came a flash so appallingly bright that in its glare
Nature seemed to be standing still.  So long did it last, that there
was time to distinguish its configuration.  It seemed like a mighty
tree inverted, pendent from the sky.  The whole country around
within the angle of vision was lit up till it seemed to glow.  Then
a broad ribbon of fire seemed to drop on to the tower of Castra
Regis just as the thunder crashed.  By the glare, Adam could see the
tower shake and tremble, and finally fall to pieces like a house of
cards.  The passing of the lightning left the sky again dark, but a
blue flame fell downward from the tower, and, with inconceivable
rapidity, running along the ground in the direction of Diana's
Grove, reached the dark silent house, which in the instant burst
into flame at a hundred different points.

At the same moment there rose from the house a rending, crashing
sound of woodwork, broken or thrown about, mixed with a quick scream
so appalling that Adam, stout of heart as he undoubtedly was, felt
his blood turn into ice.  Instinctively, despite the danger and
their consciousness of it, husband and wife took hands and listened,
trembling.  Something was going on close to them, mysterious,
terrible, deadly!  The shrieks continued, though less sharp in
sound, as though muffled.  In the midst of them was a terrific
explosion, seemingly from deep in the earth.

The flames from Castra Regis and from Diana's Grove made all around
almost as light as day, and now that the lightning had ceased to
flash, their eyes, unblinded, were able to judge both perspective
and detail.  The heat of the burning house caused the iron doors to
warp and collapse.  Seemingly of their own accord, they fell open,
and exposed the interior.  The Saltons could now look through to the
room beyond, where the well-hole yawned, a deep narrow circular
chasm.  From this the agonised shrieks were rising, growing ever
more terrible with each second that passed.

But it was not only the heart-rending sound that almost paralysed
poor Mimi with terror.  What she saw was sufficient to fill her with
evil dreams for the remainder of her life.  The whole place looked
as if a sea of blood had been beating against it.  Each of the
explosions from below had thrown out from the well-hole, as if it
had been the mouth of a cannon, a mass of fine sand mixed with
blood, and a horrible repulsive slime in which were great red masses
of rent and torn flesh and fat.  As the explosions kept on, more and
more of this repulsive mass was shot up, the great bulk of it
falling back again.  Many of the awful fragments were of something
which had lately been alive.  They quivered and trembled and writhed
as though they were still in torment, a supposition to which the
unending scream gave a horrible credence.  At moments some
mountainous mass of flesh surged up through the narrow orifice, as
though forced by a measureless power through an opening infinitely
smaller than itself.  Some of these fragments were partially covered
with white skin as of a human being, and others--the largest and
most numerous--with scaled skin as of a gigantic lizard or serpent.
Once, in a sort of lull or pause, the seething contents of the hole
rose, after the manner of a bubbling spring, and Adam saw part of
the thin form of Lady Arabella, forced up to the top amid a mass of
blood and slime, and what looked as if it had been the entrails of a
monster torn into shreds.  Several times some masses of enormous
bulk were forced up through the well-hole with inconceivable
violence, and, suddenly expanding as they came into larger space,
disclosed sections of the White Worm which Adam and Sir Nathaniel
had seen looking over the trees with its enormous eyes of emerald-
green flickering like great lamps in a gale.

At last the explosive power, which was not yet exhausted, evidently
reached the main store of dynamite which had been lowered into the
worm hole.  The result was appalling.  The ground for far around
quivered and opened in long deep chasms, whose edges shook and fell
in, throwing up clouds of sand which fell back and hissed amongst
the rising water.  The heavily built house shook to its foundations.
Great stones were thrown up as from a volcano, some of them, great
masses of hard stone, squared and grooved with implements wrought by
human hands, breaking up and splitting in mid air as though riven by
some infernal power.  Trees near the house--and therefore presumably
in some way above the hole, which sent up clouds of dust and steam
and fine sand mingled, and which carried an appalling stench which
sickened the spectators--were torn up by the roots and hurled into
the air.  By now, flames were bursting violently from all over the
ruins, so dangerously that Adam caught up his wife in his arms, and
ran with her from the proximity of the flames.

Then almost as quickly as it had begun, the whole cataclysm ceased,
though a deep-down rumbling continued intermittently for some time.
Then silence brooded over all--silence so complete that it seemed in
itself a sentient thing--silence which seemed like incarnate
darkness, and conveyed the same idea to all who came within its
radius.  To the young people who had suffered the long horror of
that awful night, it brought relief--relief from the presence or the
fear of all that was horrible--relief which seemed perfected when
the red rays of sunrise shot up over the far eastern sea, bringing a
promise of a new order of things with the coming day.


His bed saw little of Adam Salton for the remainder of that night.
He and Mimi walked hand in hand in the brightening dawn round by the
Brow to Castra Regis and on to Lesser Hill.  They did so
deliberately, in an attempt to think as little as possible of the
terrible experiences of the night.  The morning was bright and
cheerful, as a morning sometimes is after a devastating storm.  The
clouds, of which there were plenty in evidence, brought no lingering
idea of gloom.  All nature was bright and joyous, being in striking
contrast to the scenes of wreck and devastation, the effects of
obliterating fire and lasting ruin.

The only evidence of the once stately pile of Castra Regis and its
inhabitants was a shapeless huddle of shattered architecture, dimly
seen as the keen breeze swept aside the cloud of acrid smoke which
marked the site of the once lordly castle.  As for Diana's Grove,
they looked in vain for a sign which had a suggestion of permanence.
The oak trees of the Grove were still to be seen--some of them--
emerging from a haze of smoke, the great trunks solid and erect as
ever, but the larger branches broken and twisted and rent, with bark
stripped and chipped, and the smaller branches broken and
dishevelled looking from the constant stress and threshing of the
storm.

Of the house as such, there was, even at the short distance from
which they looked, no trace.  Adam resolutely turned his back on the
devastation and hurried on.  Mimi was not only upset and shocked in
many ways, but she was physically ""dog tired,"" and falling asleep on
her feet.  Adam took her to her room and made her undress and get
into bed, taking care that the room was well lighted both by
sunshine and lamps.  The only obstruction was from a silk curtain,
drawn across the window to keep out the glare.  He sat beside her,
holding her hand, well knowing that the comfort of his presence was
the best restorative for her.  He stayed with her till sleep had
overmastered her wearied body.  Then he went softly away.  He found
his uncle and Sir Nathaniel in the study, having an early cup of
tea, amplified to the dimensions of a possible breakfast.  Adam
explained that he had not told his wife that he was going over the
horrible places again, lest it should frighten her, for the rest and
sleep in ignorance would help her and make a gap of peacefulness
between the horrors.

Sir Nathaniel agreed.

""We know, my boy,"" he said, ""that the unfortunate Lady Arabella is
dead, and that the foul carcase of the Worm has been torn to pieces-
-pray God that its evil soul will neverr mmore escape from the
nethermost hell.""

They visited Diana's Grove first, not only because it was nearer,
but also because it was the place where most description was
required, and Adam felt that he could tell his story best on the
spot.  The absolute destruction of the place and everything in it
seen in the broad daylight was almost inconceivable.  To Sir
Nathaniel, it was as a story of horror full and complete.  But to
Adam it was, as it were, only on the fringes.  He knew what was
still to be seen when his friends had got over the knowledge of
externals.  As yet, they had only seen the outside of the house--or
rather, where the outside of the house once had been.  The great
horror lay within.  However, age--and the experience of age--counts.

A strange, almost elemental, change in the aspect had taken place in
the time which had elapsed since the dawn.  It would almost seem as
if Nature herself had tried to obliterate the evil signs of what had
occurred.  True, the utter ruin of the house was made even more
manifest in the searching daylight; but the more appalling
destruction which lay beneath was not visible.  The rent, torn, and
dislocated stonework looked worse than before; the upheaved
foundations, the piled-up fragments of masonry, the fissures in the
torn earth--all were at the worst.  The Worm's hole was still
evident, a round fissure seemingly leading down into the very bowels
of the earth.  But all the horrid mass of blood and slime, of torn,
evil-smelling flesh and the sickening remnants of violent death,
were gone.  Either some of the later explosions had thrown up from
the deep quantities of water which, though foul and corrupt itself,
had still some cleansing power left, or else the writhing mass which
stirred from far below had helped to drag down and obliterate the
items of horror.  A grey dust, partly of fine sand, partly of the
waste of the falling ruin, covered everything, and, though ghastly
itself, helped to mask something still worse.

After a few minutes of watching, it became apparent to the three men
that the turmoil far below had not yet ceased.  At short irregular
intervals the hell-broth in the hole seemed as if boiling up.  It
rose and fell again and turned over, showing in fresh form much of
the nauseous detail which had been visible earlier.  The worst parts
were the great masses of the flesh of the monstrous Worm, in all its
red and sickening aspect.  Such fragments had been bad enough
before, but now they were infinitely worse.  Corruption comes with
startling rapidity to beings whose destruction has been due wholly
or in part to lightning--the whole mass seemed to have become all at
once corrupt!  The whole surface of the fragments, once alive, was
covered with insects, worms, and vermin of all kinds.  The sight was
horrible enough, but, with the awful smell added, was simply
unbearable.  The Worm's hole appeared to breathe forth death in its
most repulsive forms.  The friends, with one impulse, moved to the
top of the Brow, where a fresh breeze from the sea was blowing up.

At the top of the Brow, beneath them as they looked down, they saw a
shining mass of white, which looked strangely out of place amongst
such wreckage as they had been viewing.  It appeared so strange that
Adam suggested trying to find a way down, so that they might see it
more closely.

""We need not go down; I know what it is,"" Sir Nathaniel said.  ""The
explosions of last night have blown off the outside of the cliffs--
that which we see is the vast bed of china clay through which the
Worm originally found its way down to its lair.  I can catch the
glint of the water of the deep quags far down below.  Well, her
ladyship didn't deserve such a funeral--or such a monument.""


The horrors of the last few hours had played such havoc with Mimi's
nerves, that a change of scene was imperative--if a permanent
breakdown was to be avoided.

""I think,"" said old Mr. Salton, ""it is quite time you young people
departed for that honeymoon of yours!""  There was a twinkle in his
eye as he spoke.

Mimi's soft shy glance at her stalwart husband, was sufficient
answer.

"﻿On the forenoon of a day in February, 1899, the White Star S. S.
_Cryptic_ forced her way from Pier No. 48 out into the Hudson River
through a mass of floating ice, which made a moving carpet over the
whole river from Poughkeepsie to Sandy Hook. It was little wonder that
the hearts of the outwardbound passengers were cheered with hope;
outside on the wide ocean there must be somewhere clear skies and blue
water, and perchance here and there a slant of sunshine. Come what
might, however, it must be better than what they were leaving behind
them in New York. For three whole weeks the great city had been
beleaguered by cold; held besieged in the icy grip of a blizzard
which, moving from northwest to south, had begun on the last day of
January to devastate the central North American States. In one place,
Breckenridge in Colorado, there fell in five days--and this on the top
of an accumulation of six feet of snow--an additional forty-five
inches. In the track swept by the cold wave, a thousand miles wide,
record low temperatures were effected, ranging from 15° below zero in
Indiana to 54° below at White River on the northern shore of Lake
Superior.

In New York city the temperature had sunk to 6.2° below zero, the
lowest ever recorded, and an extraordinary temperature for a city
almost entirely surrounded by tidal currents. The city itself was in a
helpless condition, paralyzed and impotent. The snow fell so fast that
even the great snow-ploughs driven by the electric current on the tram
lines could not keep the avenues clear. And the cold was so great that
the street-clearing operations--in which eight thousand men with four
thousand carts dumping some fifty thousand tons of snow daily into the
river were concerned--had to be suspended. Neither men nor horses
could endure the work. The “dead boat” which takes periodically the
city’s unclaimed corpses to Potter’s Field on Hart’s Island was twice
beaten back and nearly wrecked; it carried on the later voyage 161
corpses. Before its ghastly traffic could be resumed there were in the
city mortuaries over a thousand bodies waiting sepulture. The
“Scientific editor” of one of the great New York dailies computed that
the blanket of snow which lay on the twenty-two square miles of
Manhattan Island would form a solid wall a thousand feet high up the
whole sixty feet width of Broadway in the two and a half miles between
the Battery and Union Square, weighing some two and a half million
tons. Needless to say the streets were almost impassable. In the chief
thoroughfares were narrow passages heaped high with piled-up snow now
nearly compact to ice. In places where the falling snow had drifted it
reached to the level of, and sometimes above, the first floor windows.

As the _Cryptic_ forced her way through the rustling masses of
drifting ice the little company of passengers stood on deck watching
at first the ferry-boats pounding and hammering their strenuous way
into the docks formed by the floating guards or screens by whose aid
they shouldered themselves to their landing stages; and later on, when
the great ship following the wide circle of the steering buoys, opened
up the entrance of Sandy Hook, the great circle around them of Arctic
desolation. Away beyond the sweep of the river and ocean currents the
sea was frozen and shimmering with a carpet of pure snow, whose
luminous dreariness not even the pall of faint chill mist could
subdue. Here and there, to north and south, were many vessels frozen
in, spar and rope being roughly outlined with clinging snow. The hills
of Long Island and Staten Island and the distant ranges of New Jersey
stood out white and stark into the sky of steel.

All was grimly, deadly silent so that the throb of the engines, the
rustle and clatter of the drifting ice-pack, as the great vessel,
getting faster way as the current became more open, or the hard
scrunch as she cut through some solid floating ice-field, sounded like
something unnatural--some sound of the living amid a world of the
dead.

When the Narrows had been reached and passed and the flag of smoke
from the great chimney of the Standard Oil Refining Works lay far
behind on the starboard quarter; when Fire Island was dropping down on
the western horizon, all became changed as though the wand of some
beneficent fairy had obliterated all that was ugly or noxious in its
beneficent sweep. Sky and wave were blue; the sun beamed out; and the
white-breasted gulls sweeping above and around the ship seemed like
the spirit of nature freed from the thrall of the Ice Queen.

Naturally the spirits of the travellers rose. They too found their
wings free; and the hum and clash of happy noises arose. Unconsciously
there was a general unbending each to the other. All the stiffness
which is apt to characterize a newly gathered company of travellers
seemed to melt in the welcome sunshine; within an hour there was
established an easiness of acquaintanceship generally to be found only
towards the close of a voyage. The happiness coming with the sunshine
and the open water, and the relief from the appalling gloom of the
blizzard, had made the freed captives into friends.

At such moments like gravitates to like. The young to young; the grave
to the grave; the pleasure-lovers to their kind; free sex to its free
opposite. On the _Cryptic_ the complement of passengers was so small
that the choice of kinds was limited. In all there were only some
thirty passengers. None but adventurous spirits, or those under stress
of need, challenged a possible recurrence of Atlantic dangers which
had marked the beginning of the month, when ship after ship of the
giant liners arrived in port maimed and battered and listed with the
weight of snow and frozen spray and fog which they carried.

Naturally the ladies were greatly in the minority. After all, travel
is as a rule, men’s work; and this was no time for pleasure trips. The
dominant feeling on board on this subject was voiced in a phrase used
in the Chart room where the Captain was genially pointing out the
course to a tall, proud old man. The latter, with an uneasy gesture of
stroking his long white moustache, which seemed to be a custom or
habit at certain moments of emotion, said:

“And I quite agree with you, seh; I don’t mind men travelling in any
weather. That’s man’s share. But why in hell, seh, women want to go
gallivantin’ round the world in weather that would make any
respectable dog want to lie quiet by the fireside, I don’t know. Women
should learn----” He was interrupted by a tall young girl who burst
into the room without waiting for a reply to her breathless: “May I
come in?”

“I saw you go in, Daddy, and I wanted to see the maps too; so I raced
for all I was worth. And now I find I’ve come just in time to get
another lesson about what women ought to do!” As she spoke she linked
her arm in her father’s with a fearlessness and security which showed
that none of the natural sternness which was proclaimed in the old
man’s clear-cut face was specially reserved for her. She squeezed his
arm in a loving way and looked up in his face saucily--the way of an
affectionate young girl towards a father whom she loves and trusts.
The old man pulled his arm away and put it round her shoulder. With a
shrug which might if seen alone have denoted constraint, but with a
look in the dark eyes and a glad tone in the strong voice which
nullified it absolutely, he said to the Captain:

“Here comes my tyrant, Captain. Now I must behave myself.”

The girl standing close to him went on in the same loving
half-bantering way:

“Go on, Daddy! Tell us what women should learn!”

“They should learn, Miss Impudence, to respect their fathers!” Though
he spoke lightly in a tone of banter and with a light of affection
beaming in his eyes, the girl grew suddenly grave, and murmured
quickly:

“That is not to be learned, Father. That is born with one, when the
father is like mine!” Then turning to the Captain she went on:

“Did you ever hear of the Irishman who said: There’s some subjects too
sarious for jestin’; an’ pitaties is wan iv them? I can’t sauce my
father, or chaff him, or be impudent--though I believe he _likes_ me
to be impudent--to him, when he talks of respect. He has killed men
before now for want of that. But he won’t kill me. He knows that my
respect for him is as big as my love--and there isn’t room for any
more of either of them in me. Don’t you Daddy?”

For answer the old man drew her closer to him; but he said nothing.
Really there was no need for speech. The spirits and emotions of both
were somewhat high strung in the sudden change to brightness from the
gloom that had prevailed for weeks. At such times even the most staid
are apt to be suddenly moved.

A diversion came from the Captain, a grave, formal man as indeed
becomes one who has with him almost perpetually the responsibility of
many hundreds of lives:

“Did I understand rightly, Colonel Ogilvie that you have _killed_ men
for such a cause?” The old gentleman lifted his shaggy white eyebrows
in faint surprise, and answered slowly and with an easiness which only
half hid an ineffable disdain:

“Why, cert’nly!” The simple acceptance of the truth left the Captain
flabbergasted. He grew red and was beginning: “I thought”--when the
girl who considered it possible that a quick quarrel might arise
between the two strong men, interrupted:

“Perhaps Captain, you don’t understand our part of the world. In
Kentucky we still hold with the old laws of Honour which we sometimes
hear are dead--or at any rate back numbers--in other countries. My
father has fought duels all his life. The Ogilvies have been fighters
way back to the time of the settlement by Lord Baltimore. My Cousin
Dick tells me--for father never talks of them unless he has to--that
they never forced quarrels for their own ends; though I must say that
they are pretty touchy”--She was in turn interrupted by her father who
said quickly:

“‘Touchy’ is the word, my girl, though I fear you use it too lightly.
A man _should_ be touchy where honour is concerned. For Honour is the
first thing in all the world. What men should live for; what men
should die for! To a gentleman there is nothing so holy. And if he
can’t fight for such a sacred thing, he does not deserve to have it.
He does not know what it means.”

Through the pause came the grave voice of the Captain, a valiant man
who on state occasions wore on his right breast in accordance with the
etiquette of the occasion the large gold medal of the Royal Humane
Society:

“There are many things that men should fight for--and die for if need
be. But I am bound to say that I don’t hold that the chiefest among
them is a personal grievance; even if it be on the subject of the
measure of one’s own self-respect.” Noticing the coming frown on the
Kentuckian’s face, he went on a thought more quickly: “But, though I
don’t hold with duelling, Colonel Ogilvie, for any cause, I am bound
to say that if a man thinks and believes that it is right to fight,
then it becomes a duty which he should fulfil!”

For answer the Colonel held out his hand which the other took warmly.
That handshake cemented a friendship of two strong men who understood
each other well enough to tolerate the other’s limitations.

“And I can tell you this, seh,” said Colonel Ogilvie, “there are some
men who want killing--want it badly!”

The girl glowed. She loved to see her father strong and triumphant;
and when toleration was added to his other fine qualities, there was
an added measure in her pride of him.

There came a tap on the panelling and the doorway was darkened by the
figure of a buxom pleasant-faced woman, who spoke in a strong Irish
accent:

“I big yer pardon, Miss Ogilvie, but yer Awnt is yellin’ out for ye.
She’s thinkin’ that now the wather’s deep the ship is bound to go down
in it; an’ she sez she wants ye to be wid her whin the ind comes, as
she’s afeard to die alone!”

“That’s very thoughtful of her! Judy was always an unselfish
creature!” said the Colonel with an easy sarcasm. “Run along to her
anyhow, little girl. That’s the sort of fighting a woman has to do.
And” turning to the Captain “by Ged, seh! she’s got plenty of that
sort of fighting between her cradle and her grave!” As she went out of
the door girl said over her shoulder:

“That reminds me, daddy. Don’t go on with that lecture of yours of
what women should learn until I come back. Remember I’m only ‘a child
emerging into womanhood’--that’s what you wrote to mother when you
wouldn’t let me travel to her alone. Some one might kill me I suppose,
or steal me between this and Ischia. So it is well I should be
forewarned, and so forearmed, at all points!”

The Captain looked after her admiringly; then turning to Colonel
Ogilvie he said almost unconsciously--he had daughters of his own:

“I shouldn’t be surprised if a lot want to steal her, Colonel. And I
don’t know but they’d be right!”

“I agree with you, by Ged, seh!” said the Colonel reflectively, as he
looked after his daughter pacing with free strides along the deck with
the stout little stewardess over whom she towered by a full head.

Miss Ogilvie found her aunt, Miss Judith Hayes, in her bunk. From the
clothes hung round and laid, neatly folded, on the upper berth it was
apparent that she had undressed as for the night. When the young girl
realised this she said impulsively:

“Oh, Aunt Judy, I hope you are not ill. Do come up on deck. The sun is
shining and it is such a change from the awful weather in New York. Do
come, dear; it will do you good.”

“I am not ill Joy--in the way you mean. Indeed I was never in better
physical health in my life.” She said this with grave primness. The
girl laughed outright:

“Why on earth Aunt Judy, if you’re well, do you go to bed at ten
o’clock in the morning?” Miss Hayes was not angry; there was a
momentary gleam in her eye as she said with a manifestedly exaggerated
dignity:

“You forget my dear, that I am an old maid!”

“What has old-maidenhood to do with it? But anyhow you are not an old
maid. You are only forty!”

“Not forty, Joy! _Only_ forty, indeed! My dear child when that unhappy
period comes a single lady is put on the shelf--out of reach of all
masculine humanity. For my part I have made up my mind to climb up
there, of my own accord, before the virginal undertakers come for me.
I am in for it anyhow; and I want to play the game as well as I can.”

Joy bent down and kissed her affectionately. Then taking her face
between her strong young hands, and looking steadily in her eyes, she
said:

“Aunt Judy you are not an old anything. You are a deal younger than I
am. You mustn’t get such ideas into your head. And even if you do you
mustn’t speak them. People would begin to believe you. What is forty
anyhow!” The other answered sententiously:

“What is forty? Not old for a wife! Young for a widow! Death for a
maid!”

“Really Aunt Judy” said the girl smiling “one would think you wish to
be an old maid. Even I know better than that--and Father thinks I am
younger and more ignorant than the yellow chick that has just pecked
its way out of the shell. The woman has not yet been born--nor ever
will be--who wants to be an old maid.”

Judith Hayes raised herself on one elbow and said calmly:

“Or a young one, my dear!” Then as if pleased with her epigram she
sank back on her pillow with a smile. Joy paused; she did not know
what to say. A diversion came from the stewardess who had all the time
stood in the doorway waiting for some sort of instructions:

“Bedad, Miss Hayes, it’s to Ireland ye ought to come. A lovely young
lady like yerself--for all yer jabber about an ould maid iv
forty--wouldn’t be let get beyant Queenstown, let alone the Mall in
Cork. Bedad if ye was in Athlone its the shillelaghs that would be out
an’ the byes all fightin’ for who’d get the hould on to ye first.
Whisper me now, is it coddin’ us ye be doin’ or what?” Joy turned
round to her, her face all dimpled with laughter, and said:

“That’s the way to talk to her Mrs. O’Brien. You just take her in
hand; and when we get to Queenstown find some nice big Irishman to
carry her off.”

“Bedad I will! An sorra the shtruggle she’d make agin it anyhow I’m
thinkin’!” Aunt Judy laughed:

“Joy” she said “you’d better be careful yourself or maybe she’d put on
some of her bachelor press-gang to abduct you.”

“Don’t you be onaisy about that ma’am,” said Mrs. O’Brien quietly.
“I’ve fixed that already! When I seen Miss Joy come down the companion
shtairs I sez to meself: ‘There’s only wan man in Ireland--an that’s
in all the wurrld--that’s good enough for you, me darlin’. An he’ll
have you for sure or I’m a gandher!’”

“Indeed!” said Joy, blushing in spite of herself. “And may I be
permitted to know my ultimate destination in the way of matrimony? You
won’t think me inquisitive or presuming I trust.” Her eyes were
dancing with the fun of the thing. Mrs. O’Brien laughed heartily; a
round, cheery, honest laugh which was infectious:

“Wid all the plisure in life Miss. Shure there’s only the wan, an him
the finest and beautifullest young man ye iver laid yer pritty eyes
on. An him an Earrl, more betoken; wid more miles iv land iv his own
then there does be pitaties in me ould father’s houldin! Musha, he’s
the only wan that’s at all fit to take yer swate self in his charrge!”

“H’m! Quite condescending of him I am sure. And now what may be his
sponsorial and patronymic appellatives?” Mrs. O’Brien at once became
grave. To an uneducated person, and more especially an Irish person,
an unknown phrase is full of mystery. It makes the listener feel small
and disconcerted, touching the personal pride which is so marked a
characteristic of all degrees of the Irish race. Joy, with the quick
understanding which was not the least of her endowments, saw that she
had made a mistake and hastened to set matters right before the
chagrin had time to bite deep:

“Forgive me, but that was _my_ fun. What I meant to ask are the name
and title of my destined Lord and Master?” The stewardess answered
heartily, the ruffle of her face softening into an amiable smile:

“Amn’t I tellin’ ye miss. Shure there is only the wan!”

“And who may he be?”

“Faix he may be anything. It’s a King or a Kazer or an Imperor or a
Czaar he’d be if I had the ordherin’ iv it. But what he is is the
Right Honourable the Earl av Athlyne. Lord Liftinant av the County iv
Roscommon--an’ a jool!”

“Oh, an Irishman!” said Miss Judy. Mrs. O’Brien snorted; her national
pride was hurt:

“An Irishman! God be thanked he is. But me Lady, av it’ll plaze ye
betther he’s an Englishman too, an’ a Welshman an’ a Scotchman as
well! Oh, th’ injustice t’ Ireland. Him borrn in Roscommon, an yit a
Scotchman they call him bekase his biggest title is Irish!”

“Mrs. O’Brien, that’s all nonsense,” said Miss Judy tartly. “We may be
Americans; but we’re not to be played for suckers for all that! How
can a Scotchman have an Irish title?”

“That’s all very well, Miss Hayes, yous Americans is very cliver; but
yez don’t know everything. An’ I may be an ignorant ould fool; but I’m
not so ignorant as ye think, ayther. Wasn’t there a Scotchman thit was
marrid on the granddaughther iv Quane Victory hersilf--An Errll begob,
what owned the size iv a counthry in Scotland. An him all the time wid
an Irish Errldom, till they turned him into a Sassenach be makin’ him
a Juke. Begorra! isn’t it proud th’ ould Laady should ha’ been to git
an Irishman iv any kind for the young girrl! Shure an isn’t Athlyne as
good as Fife any day. Hasn’t he castles an’ estates in Scotland an’
England an Wales, as well as in Ireland. Isn’t he an ould Bar’n iv
some kind in Scotland an him but a young man! Begob! av it’s Ireland
y’ objict to ye can take him as Scotch--where they say he belongs an’
where he chose to live whin he became a grown man, before he wint into
th’ Army!”

Somehow or other the announcement and even the grandiose manner of its
making gave pleasure to Joy. After all, the compliment of the
stewardess was an earnest one. She had chosen for her the best that
she knew. What more could she do? With a sudden smile she made a
sweeping curtsey, the English Presentation curtsey which all American
girls are taught, and said:

“Let me convey to you the sincere thanks of the Countess of Athlyne!
Aunt Judy do you feel proud of having a Peeress for a niece? Any time
you wish to be presented you can call on the services of Lady
Athlyne.” She suddenly straightened herself to her full height as Mrs.
O’Brien spoke with a sort of victorious howl:

“Hurroo! Now ye’ve done it. Ye’ve said the wurrds yerself; an’ we all
know what that manes!”

“What does it mean?” Joy spoke somewhat sharply, her face all aflame.
It appeared that she had committed some unmaidenly indiscretion.

“It manes that it manes the same as if ye said ‘yis!’ to me gentleman
when persooin’ iv his shute. It’s for all the wurrld the same as bein’
marrid on to him!”

In spite of the ridiculousness of the statement Joy thrilled inwardly.
Unconsciously she accepted the position of peeress thus thrust upon
her.

After all, the Unknown has its own charms for the human heart. Those
old Athenians who built the altars “To the Unknown God,” did but put
into classic phrase the aspirations of a people by units as well as in
mass. Mrs. O’Brien’s enthusiastic admiration laid seeds of some kind
in the young girl’s heart.

Her instinct was, however, not to talk of it; and as a protective
measure she changed the conversation:

“But you haven’t told me yet, Aunt Judy, why you went to bed in the
morning because you pretend to be an old maid.” The Irishwoman here
struck in:

“I’m failin’ to comprehind that meself too. If ye was a young wife now
I could consave it, maybe. Or an ould widda-woman like meself that
does have to be gettin’ up in the night to kape company wid young
weemin that doesn’t like to die, alone …” she burst into hearty
laughter in which Miss Judith Hayes joined. Joy took advantage of the
general hilarity to try to persuade her aunt to come on deck. She
finished her argument:

“And the Captain is such a nice man. He’s just a wee bit too grave. I
think he must be a widower.” Aunt Judy made no immediate reply; but
after some more conversation she said to the stewardess:

“I think I will get up Mrs. O’Brien. Perhaps a chair on deck in the
sunshine will be better for me than staying down here. And, after all,
if I have to die it will be better to die in the open than in a bed
the size of a coffin!”

When Joy rejoined her father in the Chart-room she said to the
Captain:

“That stewardess of yours is a dear!” He warmly acquiesced:

“She is really a most capable person; and all the ladies whom she
attends grow to be quite fond of her. She is always kind and cheery
and hearty and makes them forget that they are ill or afraid. When I
took command of the _Cryptic_ I asked the company to let her come with
me.”

“And quite right too, Captain. That brogue of hers is quite
wonderful!”

“It is indeed. But, my dear young lady, its very perfection makes me
doubt it. It is so thick and strong and ready, and the way she twists
words into its strength and makes new ones to suit it give me an idea
at times that it is partly put on. I sometimes think it is impossible
that any one can be so absolutely and imperatively Irish as she is.
However, it serves her in good stead; she can say, without offence,
whatever she chooses in her own way to any one. She is a really clever
woman and a kind one; and I have the greatest respect for her.”

When Aunt Judy was left alone with the stewardess, she asked:

“Who is Lord Athlyne?--What kind of man is he? Where does he live?”

“Where does he live?--Why everywhere! In Athlyne for one, but a lot iv
other places as well. He was brought up at the Castle where the ould
Earrl always lived afther he lift Parlimint; and whin he was a boy he
was the wildest young dare-devil iver ye seen. Faix, the County
Roscommon itself wasn’t big enough for him. When he was a young man he
wint away shootin’ lions and tigers and elephants and crockodiles and
such like. Thin he wint into th’ army an began to settle down. He has
a whole lot av different houses, and he goes to them all be times. He
says that no man has a right to be an intire absentee landlord--even
when he’s livin’ in his own house!”

“But what sort of man is he personally?” she asked persistently. The
Irishwoman’s answer was direct and comprehensive:

“The bist!”

“How do you know that?”

“An’ how do I know it! Amn’t I a Roscommon woman, borrn, an’ wan av
the tinants? Wouldn’t that be enough? But that’s only the beginnin’.
Shure wasn’t I his fosther-mother, God bless him! Wasn’t he like me
own child when I tuk him to me breast whin his poor mother died the
day he was borrn. Ah, Miss Hayes there’s nothin’ ye don’t know about
the child ye have given suck to. More, betoken, than if he was yer own
child; for he might be thinkin’ too much of _him_ an puttin’ the bist
consthruction on ivery little thing he iver done, just because he was
yer own. Troth I didn’t want any tellin’ about Athlyne. The sweetest
wean that iver a woman nursed; the tindherest hearted, wid the wee
little hands upon me face an his rosebud av a mouth puttin’ up to me
for a kiss! An’ yit the pride av him; more’n a King on his throne. An’
th’ indepindince! Him wantin’ to walk an’ run before he was able to
shtand. An’ ordherin’ about the pig an’ the gandher, let alone the
dog. Shure the masterfullest man-child that iver was, and the
masterfullest man that is. Sorra wan like him in the whole wide
wurrld!”

“You seem to love him very much,” said Miss Hayes with grave approval.

“In coorse I do! An’ isn’t it me own boy that was his fosther brother
that loves him too. Whin the Lard wint out to fight the Boors, Mick
wint wid him as his own body man until he was invalided home wid a bad
knee; an’ him a coachman now an’ doin’ nothin’ but take his wages; And
whin he kem to Liverpool to say good-bye when the _Cryptic_ should
come in I tould him to take care of his Masther. ‘Av ye don’t,’ sez I,
‘ye’re no son iv mine, nor iv yer poor dear father, rest his sowl!
Kape betune him an’ any bullet that’s comin’ his way’ I sez. An’ wid
that he laughed out loud in me face. ‘That’s good, mother,’ sez he,
‘an iv coorse I’d be proud to; but I’d like to set eyes on the man
that’d dar to come betune Athlyne an’ a bullet, or to prevint him
cuttin’ slices from aff iv the Boors wid his big cav-a-lary soord,’ he
sez. ‘Begob,’ he sez, ‘t’would be worse nor fightin’ the Boors
themselves to intherfere wid him whin he’s set on his way!’”

“That’s loyal stock! He’s a Man, that son of yours!” said Miss Judy
enthusiastically, forgetting her semi-cynical rôle of old maid in the
ardour of the moment. The stewardess seeing that she had a good
listener went on:

“And ’tis the thoughtful man he is. He niver writes to me, bekase he
knows well I can’t read. But he sends me five pounds every Christmas.
On me birthday he gev me this, Lord love him!” She took a gold watch
from her bosom and showed it with pride.

When she was dressed, Miss Hayes looked into the Library; and finding
it empty took down the “de Brett,” well thumbed by American use. Here
is what she saw on looking up “Athlyne.”


ATHLYNE EARL OF FITZGERALD

Calinus Patrick Richard Westerna Hardy Mowbray FitzGerald 2nd Earl of
Athlyne (in the Peerage of the United Kingdom). 2nd Viscount Roscommon
(in the Peerage of Ireland). 30th Baron Ceann-da-Shail (in the Peerage
of Scotland). b. 6 June 1875 s. 1886 ed. Eton and University of
Dublin; is D. L. for Counties of Ross and Roscommon: J. P. for
Counties of Wilts, Ross and Roscommon.

_Patron of three livings_:--Raphoon, New Sands, and Politore.

_Seats_. Ceann-da-Shail Castle and Castle of Elandonan in Ross-shire,
Athlyne Castle C. Roscommon. Travy Manor, Gloucestershire and The Rock
Beach, Cornwall, &c. &c. _Town Residence_. 40 St. James’s Square
S. W.

_Clubs_. Reform. Marlborough. United Service. Naval and Military.
Garick. Arts. Bath &c.

_Predecessors_. Sir Calinus FitzGerald--descended from Calinus
FitzGerald the first of the name settled in Ross-shire, to which he
came from Ireland in the XII century--was created by Robert the Bruce
Baron Ceann-da-Shail, 1314, and endowed with the Castle of Elandonan
(Gift of the King) as the reward of a bold rally of the Northern
troops at Bannockburn. Before his death in 1342 he built for himself a
strongly fortified Castle on the Island of Ceann-da-Shail (from which
his estate took its name) celebrated from time immemorial for a
wonderful spring of water. The Barony has been held in direct descent
with only two breaks. The first was in 1642 when direct male issue
having failed through the death of the only son of Calinus the XXth
Baron the Peerage and estates reverted to Robert Calinus e. s. of
James, 2nd s. of Robert XVIII Baron. The second was in 1826 when,
again through the early decease of an only son, the Barony reverted to
Robert e. s. of Malcolm 2nd s. of Colin XXVII Baron. The father of
this heritor, Malcolm FitzGerald, had settled in Ireland in 1782.
There he had purchased a great estate fronting on the River Shannon in
Roscommon on which he had built a castle, Athlyne. Malcolm FitzGerald
entered the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1805 and sat for 22
years when he was succeeded in Parliamentary honours by his son Robert
on his coming of age in 1827. Robert held his seat until the creation
of the Viscounty of Roscommon 1870. Three years after his retirement
from the House of Commons he was raised to an Earldom--Athlyne.


When she went out on deck she found her niece taking with her father
the beef tea which had just been brought round. She did not mention to
Colonel Ogilvie the little joke about Lady Athlyne, and strange to say
found that Joy to whom a joke or a secret was a matter of fungoid
growth, multiplying and irrepressible, had not mentioned it either.




CHAPTER II.
IN ITALY

During the voyage, which had its own vicissitudes, the joke was kept
up amongst the three women. The stewardess, seeing that the two ladies
only spoke of it in privacy, exemplified that discretion which the
Captain had commended. Only once did she forget herself, but even then
fortune was on her side. It was during a day when Joy was upset by a
spell of heavy weather and had to keep her cabin. In the afternoon her
father paid a visit to her; and Mrs. O’Brien in reporting progress to
him said that “her Ladyship” was now on the road to recovery and would
be on deck very shortly. Colonel Ogilvie made quite a lot of the error
which he read in his own way. He said to his sister-in-law as they
paced the deck together:

“Capital woman that stewardess! There is a natural deference and
respect in her manner which you do not always find in people of her
class. Will you oblige me, Judy, by seeing, when the voyage is over,
that she gets an extra honorarium!” Judy promised, and deftly turned
the conversation; she felt that she was on dangerous ground.

Judith Hayes called herself an old maid, not believing it to be true;
but all the same there was in her make-up a distinctive trait of it:
the manner in which she regarded a romance. Up to lately, romance
however unlikely or improbable, had a personal bearing; it did not
occur to her that it might not drift in her direction. But now she
felt unconsciously that such romance must have other objective than
herself. The possibility, therefore, of a romance for Joy whom she
very sincerely loved was a thing to be cherished. She could see, as
well as feel, that her niece by keeping it a secret from her father
had taken the matter with at least a phase of seriousness. This alone
was sufficient to feed her own imaginings; and in the glow her
sympathies quickened. She had instinctively at the beginning
determined not to spoil sport; now it became a conscious intention.

Mrs. O’Brien, too, in her own way helped to further the matter. She
felt that she had a good audience for her little anecdotes of the
child whose infancy she had fostered, and towards whom in his
completed manhood she had a sort of almost idolatrous devotion. Seeing
the girl so sympathetic and listening so patiently, she too began to
see something like the beginnings of a fact. And so the game went
merrily on.

The telegrams at Queenstown were not very reassuring, and Colonel
Ogilvie and his party pressed on at once to Sorrento whence his wife
had moved on the completion of her series of baths at Ischia.
Naturally the whole of the little party was depressed, until on
arrival they found Mrs. Ogilvie, who was something of a
valetudinarian, much better than they expected. The arrival of her
husband and daughter and sister seemed to complete her cure; she
brightened up at once, and even after a few days began to enjoy
herself.

One day after lunch as she drove along the road to Amalfi with Judith
and Joy--the Colonel was lazy that day and preferred to sit on the
terrace over the sea and smoke--she began to ask all the details of
the journey. Judy who had not had a chance of speaking alone with
safety began to tell the little secret. Her method of commencement was
abrupt, and somewhat startling to the convalescent:

“We’ve got a husband for Joy, at last!”

“Gracious!” said Mrs. Ogilvie. “What do you mean, Judy? Is this one of
your pranks?”

“Prank indeed!” she answered back, tossing her head. “A real live
lord! A belted Earl if you please--whatever that may mean.”

“Is this true, Joy?” said her mother beaming anxiously on her--if such
a combination is understandable. Joy took her hand and stroked it
lovingly:

“Do you think, Mother dear, that if there was such a thing I should
leave you all this time in ignorance of it. It is only a jest made up
by the stewardess who attended us on the _Cryptic_. Aunt Judy seems to
have taken it all in; I think dear you had better ask her; she seems
to know all about it--which is certainly more than I do.”

“And how did this common woman dare to jest on such a subject. I don’t
think Judy that this would have happened had I been with her myself!”

“Oh my dear, get off that high horse. There’s nothing to be alarmed
about. The stewardess--who is a most worthy and attentive person----”

“She is a dear!” interrupted Joy.

“--took such a fancy to Joy that she said there was only ‘wan’ in all
the world who was worthy of her--a young nobleman to whom she had been
foster-mother. It was certainly meant as a very true compliment, and I
am bound to say that if the young man merits a hundredth part of all
she said of him there’s certainly no cause of offence in the mere
mentioning his name.”

“What is his name?” There was a shade of anxiety in the mother’s
voice.

“Lord Athlyne!”

“The Earl of Athlyne!” said Joy speaking without thought. Then she
turned quickly away to hide her blushing.

“I--I--I really don’t understand!” said Mrs. Ogilvie, looking around
helplessly. Then with the shadow of a shade of annoyance in her voice
she went on:

“I really think that in a serious matter of this kind I should have
been consulted. But I seem not to count for anything any more. Colonel
Ogilvie has not even mentioned the matter to me. I think I ought to
have some say in anything of importance relating to my little girl.”

“Lord bless the woman!” said Aunt Judy throwing up her hands and
lifting her eyes. “Sally dear don’t you comprehend that this was all a
joke. We never saw this young Lord, never heard of him till the
stewardess mentioned him; and as for him he doesn’t know or care
whether there is such a person in the world as Joy Ogilvie----” The
mother interrupted hotly--it seemed want of respect to her child:

“Then he ought to care. I’d like to know who he is to consider himself
so high and mighty that even my little girl isn’t … Oh! I have no
patience with him.”

There was silence in the carriage. Mrs. Ogilvie had come to the end of
her remonstrance, and both the others were afraid to speak. It was all
so supremely ridiculous. And yet the mother was taking it all so
seriously that respect for her forbade laughter. The road was here
steep and the horses were laboriously climbing their way. Presently
Judy turned to Joy saying:

“Wouldn’t you like to look at the view from the edge of the cliff?” As
she spoke she looked meaningly at her niece who took the hint and got
down.

When she was out of earshot and the driver had stopped the horses Judy
turned to her sister and said with a quiet, incisive directness quite
at variance with all her previous moods:

“Sally dear I want to speak a moment to you quite frankly and, believe
me, very earnestly. I know you don’t usually credit me with much
earnestness; but this is about Joy, and that is always earnest with
me.” All the motherhood in Mrs. Ogilvie answered to the call. She sat
up with eager intensity, receptive to the full and without any
disturbing chagrin. Judy went on:

“You have been thinking of your ‘little girl’--and actually speaking
of her as such. That is the worst of mothers--their one fault. With
them time seems to stand still. The world goes flying by them, but in
their eyes the child remains the same. Gold hair or black turns to
white, wrinkles come, knees totter and steps become unsteady; but the
child goes on--still, in the mother’s eyes, dressing dolls and chasing
butterflies. They don’t even seem to realise facts when the child puts
her own baby into the grandmother’s arms. Look round for a moment
where Joy is standing there outlined against that Moorish tower on the
edge of the cliff. Tell me what do you see?”

“I see my dear, beautiful little girl!” said the mother faintly.

“Hm!” said Judy defiantly. “That’s not exactly what I see. I agree
with the ‘dear’ and ‘beautiful’; she’s all that and a thousand times
more.”

“Tell me what you do see, Judy!” said the mother in a whisper as she
laid a gentle hand imploringly on her sister’s arm. She was trembling
slightly. Judy took her hand and stroked it tenderly. “I know!” she
said gently “I know. I know!” The mother took heart from her
tenderness and said in an imploring whisper:

“Be gentle with me, Judy. She is all I have; and I fear her passing
away from me.”

“Not that--not yet at all events!” she answered quickly. “The time is
coming no doubt. But it is because we should be ready for it that I
want to speak. We at least ought to know the exact truth!”

“The exact truth … Oh Judy …!”

“Don’t be frightened, dear. There is nothing to fear. The truth is all
love and goodness. But my dear we are all but mortal after all, and
the way to keep right is to think truly.”

“Tell me exactly what you see! Tell me everything no matter how small.
I shall perhaps understand better that way!”

Judy paused a while, looking at the young girl lovingly. Then she
spoke in a level absent voice as though unconsciously.

“I don’t see a child--now. I see a young woman of twenty; and a fine
well-grown young woman at that. Look at her figure, straight and clean
as a young pine. Type of figure that is the most alluring of all to
men; what the French call _fausse maigre_. She has great gray eyes as
deep as the sky or the sea; eyes that can drag the soul out of a man’s
body and throw it down beneath her dainty feet. I may be an old maid;
but I know that much anyhow. Her hair is black--that isn’t black, but
with a softness that black cannot give. Her skin is like ivory seen in
the sunset. Her mouth is like a crimson rosebud. Her teeth are like
pearls, and her ears like pink shell. Her head is poised on her
graceful neck like a lily on its stem. Her nose is a fine
aquiline--that means power and determination. Her forehead can
wrinkle--that means thought, and may mean misery. Her hands are long
and fine; patrician hands that can endure--and suffer. Sally, there is
there the making of a splendid woman and of a noble life; she is not
out of her girlhood yet, but she is very near it. Ignorance is no use
to her. She _will_ understand; and then she will take her own course.
She has feeling deep and strong in the very marrow of her bones. Ah!
my dear, and she has passion too. Passion that can make or mar. That
woman will do anything for love. She can believe and trust. And when
she believes and trusts she will hold the man as her master; put him
up on a pedestal and be content to sit at his feet and worship--and
obey … She …”

Here the mother struck in with surprised consternation “How on earth
do you know all this?” Judy turned towards her with a light in her
eyes which her sister had never seen there:

“How do I know it! Because she is of my blood and yours. Have I not
seen a lot of it in you in our babyhood. Have I not gone through it
all myself--the longing part of it--the wishing and hoping and praying
and suffering. Do you think Sally that I have arrived at old maidhood
without knowing what a young maid thinks and feels; without having any
share of the torture that women must bear in some form or another. I
know it all as well as though it was all fresh before me instead of a
lurid memory. Ah, my dear she has all our nature--and her father’s
too. And he never learned the restraint that we had to learn--and
practice. When she is face to face with passion she may find herself
constrained to take it as he has always done: for life or death!” …
She paused a moment, panting with the intensity of her feeling. Then
she went on more quietly:

“Sally, isn’t it wiser to let her, in her youth and ignorance of
herself and the world, break herself in to passion and romance. It
would be hard to get a safer object for sentimental affection than a
man she never saw and is never likely to meet. After all, he is only
an idea; at best a dream. In good time he will pass out of her mind
and give place to something more real. But in the meantime she will
have learned--learned to understand, to find herself.” Then she sat
silent till Joy turned round and began to walk towards them. At this
the mother said quietly:

“Thank you, dear Judy. I think I understand. You are quite right, and
I am glad you told me.”

That journey round the Sorrentine Peninsula became a part of Joy’s
life. It was not merely that every moment was a new pleasure, a fresh
delight to the eye; her heart was in some mysterious way beginning to
be afire. Hitherto her thoughts of that abstract creation, Lord
Athlyne, had been impersonal: an objective of her own unconscious
desires, rather than a definite individuality. Up to now, though he
had been often in her thoughts, he had never taken shape there. The
image was so inchoate, indefinite, vague and nebulous. She had never
tried or even wished to find for him in her imagination features or
form. But now she had begun to picture him in various ways. As she
stood beside the Moorish tower looking down across the rugged slope of
rock and oleander at the wrinkled sea beneath, his image seemed to
flit before the eyes of her soul in kaleidoscopic form. It was an
instance of true feminine receptivity: the form did not matter, she
was content to accept the Man.

The cause--the sudden cause of this change was her mother’s attitude.
She had accepted him as a reality and had not hesitated to condemn him
as though he was a conscious participant in what had passed. Joy had
found herself placed in a position in which she had to hear him
unfairly treated, without being able to make any kind of protest. It
was too ridiculous to argue. What on earth could her mother know about
him that she should take it for granted that he had done wrong? He who
had never seen her or even heard of her! He who was the very last man
in the world to be wanting to a woman in the way of respect--of
tenderness--of love. … Here she started and looked around cautiously
as one does who is suspicious of being watched. For it flashed across
her all at once that she knew no more of him than did her mother. As
yet he was only an abstraction; and her mother’s conception of him
differed from hers. And as she thought, and thought truly for she was
a clever girl, she began to realise that she had all along been
clothing an abstract individuality with her own wishes and dreams--and
hopes. … The last thought brought her up sharply. With a quick shake
of the head she threw aside for the present all thoughts on the
subject, and impulsively went back to the carriage.

There were however a few root thoughts left which _would_ not be
thrown aside. They could not be, for they were fixed in her womanhood.
Another woman had accepted her dream as a reality; and now, as that
reality was her doing, he was her own man. And he was misunderstood
and blamed and unfairly treated! It was her duty to protect him!

Had Aunt Judy been aware of her logical process and its conclusion she
could have expressed it thus:

“Hm! a man in her mind.--_Her_ man. Her duty to protest. … We all
know what that means. He’s only in her mind at present … Hm!”

The whole day was spent on the road, for the beauty was such that the
stoppages were endless. Joy, with the new-arisen soul which took her
out of her own thoughts, found delight in every moment. She could
hardly contain her rapture as fresh vistas of beauty burst upon her.
When the curve of the promontory began to cut off the view of Vesuvius
and the plain seaward of it, she got out of the carriage and ran back
to where she could have a full view. Underneath her lay the wonderful
scene of matchless beauty. To the right rose Vesuvius a mass of warm
colour, with its cinder cone staring boldly into the blue sky, a faint
cloud hanging over it like a flag. Below it was the sloping plain
dotted with trees and villas and villages, articulated in the clear
air like a miniature map. Then the great curve of the bay, the
sapphire sea marked clearly on the outline of the coast from Ischia
which rose like a jewel from a jewel. Past Naples, a clustering mass
with San Martino standing nobly out and the great fortress crowning
grimly the hill above it. Past Portici and the buried Herculaneum;
till getting closer the roofs and trees and gardens seemed to run up
to where she stood. To the left, a silhouette of splendid soft purple,
rose the island of Capri from the sea of sapphire which seemed to
quiver in the sunshine. Long she looked, and then closing her eyes to
prove that the lovely image still held in the darkness, she turned
with a long sigh of ecstasy and walked slowly to the waiting carriage.

Again and again she stooped, till at last she made up her mind to walk
altogether until she should get tired. The driver took his cue from
her movements when to stop and when to go on.

The road round the Peninsula runs high up the mountain side with
mostly a steep precipice to seaward and on the other hand towering
rocks. But such rocks! And so clad with the finest vegetation! Rocks
rich in colour and quaint in shape; with jagged points and deep
crevices in which earth could gather and where trees and shrubs and
flowers could cling. High over-head hung here and there a beautiful
stone-pine with red twisted trunk and spreading branches. Fig and
lemon trees rose in the sheltered angles, the long yellow shoots of
the new branches of the lemon cutting into the air like lances.
Elsewhere beech and chestnut, oak and palm. Trailing over the rock,
both seaward and landward, creepers of soft green and pink. And above
all, high up on the skyline, the semi-transparent, smoke-coloured
foliage of the olives that crowned the slopes.

Then the towns! Maggiore and Amalfi quaint close-drawn irregular
relics of a more turbulent age, climbing up the chasms in the
hillside. Narrow streets, so steep as to look impossible to traffic.
Queer houses of all sorts of irregular design and variety of stone.
Small windows, high doors, steep, rugged irregularly-sloping steps as
though time and some mighty force had shaken the very rock on which
they were built. Joy felt as though she could stay there for ever, and
that each day would be a dream, and each fresh exploration a time of
delight. In her secret heart of hearts she registered a vow that if
ever she should go on a wedding journey it should be to there.

At Amalfi they had tea, and then made up their minds that they would
drive on to Salerno and there take train home; for it would be time to
travel quick when so long a journey had been taken.

When they were at the end of the peninsula a sudden storm came on. For
awhile they had seen far out at sea a dark cloud gathering, but it was
so far away that they did not think it would affect them. The driver
knew and began to make ready, for there was no escaping from it. He
turned his horses’ heads to the rock and wedged up the wheels of the
carriage with heavy stones so that in case the horses should get
frightened their plunging could not be too harmful.

Heavier and heavier grew the cloud out at sea, and as it grew denser
it moved landward. Its grey changed to dark blue and then to a rich
purple, almost black. A keen coldness presaged a coming storm.

There was stillness all round the mountain road; a positive desolation
of silence from which even the wondrous beauty of the scene could not
distract the mind. Joy absolutely refused to sit in the carriage which
was now properly hooded. She threw on the cloak which she had brought
with her and stood out on the open road where she could enjoy the
scene undisturbed by human proximity. As she stood, the velvet black
cloud was rent by a blinding sheet of lightning which seemed for a
moment to be shaped like a fiery tree, roots upward in the sky. Close
following came such a mighty peal of thunder that her heart shook.
Ordinarily Joy was not timorous, and for thunder she had no fear. But
this was simply terrific; it seemed to burst right over her head and
to roll around her in a prolonged titanic roar. She was about to run
to the carriage when she heard the shrieks of fear from the two women;
the driver was on his knees on the road praying. Joy felt that all she
could do to help her mother and aunt would be to keep calm--as calm as
she could. So she moved her hand and called out cheerfully:

“Don’t be afraid! It is all right; the lightning has passed us!” As
she spoke the rain came down in torrents. It was tropical; in a few
seconds the open road was running like a river, ankle deep. By the
exercise of her will the girl’s courage had risen. She could now
actually enjoy what was before her. Far out to sea the black cloud
still hung, but it was broken up in great masses which seemed to dip
into the sea. It was almost as dark as night; so dark that the expanse
became lit by the lightning flashes. In one of these she saw three
separate water-spouts. The sea appeared to have risen as the cloud
sank, and now were far apart three great whirling pillars like
hour-glasses. And then, wonder of wonders, without turning her head
but only her eyes she could see away to the left a whole world of
green expanse backed up by the mountains of Calabria. With each second
the sinking sun brought into view some new hilltop flaming in the
glow. A little way in front of her at the southern side of the
peninsula the copper dome of the church at Vietri glowed like a ball
of fire. Away to the south on the edge of the sea rose the many
columns of the majestic ruins of Pæstum, standing still and solemn as
if untouchable by stress of storm or time.

Joy stood entranced, as though the eyes of her soul had opened on a
new world. She hardly dared to breathe. The pelting of the rainstorm,
the rush of the water round her feet, the crash and roar of the
thunder or the hissing glare of the lightning did not move or disturb
her. It was all a sort of baptism into a new life.

Joy Ogilvie, like all persons of emotional nature, had quick sympathy
with natural forces and the moods of nature. The experience of the
day, based on the superlative beauty around her, had waked all the
emotional nature within her. Naples is always at spring time; and the
young heart finding naturally its place amongst the things that
germinate and develop unconsciously, swayed with and was swayed by the
impulses of her sex. Beauty and manhood had twin position in her
virgin breast.

Aunt Judy’s insight or prophecy was being realised quicker than she
thought. Joy’s sex had found her out!




 CHAPTER III.
 DE HOOGE’S SPRUIT

In Italy Joy Ogilvie learned to the full, consciously and
unconsciously, all the lessons which a younger civilisation can learn
from an elder. To the sympathetic there are lessons in everything;
every spot that a stranger foot has pressed has something to teach.
Especially to one coming from the rush of strenuous life, which is the
note of America, the old-world calm and luxury of repose have lessons
in toleration which can hardly be otherwise acquired. In the great
battle of life we do not match ourselves against individuals but
against nations and epochs; and when it is finally borne in on us that
others, fashioned as we ourselves and with the same strength and
ambitions and limitations, have lived and died and left no individual
mark through the gathering centuries, we can, without sacrifice of
personal pride, be content to humbly take each his place.

The month spent at and round Naples had been a never-ending dream of
delight; and this period of quiescence told on her naturally sensuous
nature. Already she had accepted the idea of a man worthy of love; and
the time went to the strengthening of the image. There was a subtle
satisfactoriness in the received idea; the wealth of her nature had
found a market--of a kind. That is to say: she was satisfied to
export, and that was the end of her thoughts--for the present.
Importation might come later,

  “The mind’s Rialto hath its merchandise.”

None of the family ever alluded to Lord Athlyne in the presence of her
father. Each in her own way knew that he would not like the idea; and
so the secret--it had by this very reticence grown to be a secret by
now--was kept.

On the voyage back to New York Joy’s interest in Lord Athlyne became
revived by the surroundings. They had not been able to secure cabins
in the _Cryptic_; and so had come by the Hamburg-American Line from
Southampton. By this time Aunt Judy’s interest in the matter had begun
to wane. To her it had been chiefly a jest, with just that spice of
earnest which came from the effect which she supposed the episode
would have on Joy’s life. As Joy did not ever allude to the matter she
had almost ceased to remember it.

It was Joy’s duty--she thought of it as her privilege--to make her
father’s morning cocktail which he always took before breakfast. One
morning it was brought by Judy. Colonel Ogilvie thanking her asked why
he had the privilege of her ministration. Unthinkingly she answered:

“Oh it’s all right. The Countess made it herself, but she asked me to
take it to you as she is feeling the rolling of the ship and wants to
keep in bed.”

“The who?” asked the Colonel his brows wrinkled in wonder. “What
Countess? I did not know we had one on board.”

“Lady Athlyne of course. Oh!” she had suddenly recollected herself. As
she saw she was in for an explanation she faced the situation boldly
and went on:

“That is the name you know, that we call Joy.”

“The name you call Joy--the Countess! Lady Athlyne! What on earth do
you mean, Judy? I don’t understand.” In a laughing, offhand way, full
of false merriment she tried to explain, her brother-in-law listening
the while with increasing gravity. When she had done he said quietly:

“Is this one of your jokes, Judy; or did this Countess make two
cocktails?” He stopped and then added: “Forgive me I should not have
said that. But is it a joke, dear?”

“Not a bit!” she answered spiritedly. “That is, this particular
occasion is not a joke. It is the whole thing that is that.”

“A joke to take … Is there a real man of the name of the Earl of
Athlyne?”

“I believe so,” she said this faintly; she had an idea of what was
coming.

“Then Judith I should like some rational explanation of how you come
to couple my daughter’s name in such a way with that of a strange man.
It is not seemly to say the least of it. Does my daughter allow this
to be done?”

“Oh Colonel, it is only a joke amongst ourselves. I hope you won’t
make too much of it.”

“Too much of it! I couldn’t make enough of it! If the damned fellow
was here I’d shoot him!”

“But, my God, the man doesn’t know anything about it; no more than you
did a minute ago.” Miss Judith was really alarmed; she knew the
Colonel. He waved his hand as though dismissing her from the argument:

“Don’t worry yourself, my dear: this is a matter amongst men. We know
how to deal with such things!” He said no more on the subject, but
talked during breakfast as usual. When he rose to go on deck Judy
followed him timidly. When they were away from the few already on deck
she touched him on the arm.

“Give me just a minute?” she entreated.

“A score if you like, my dear!” he answered heartily as he led her to
a seat in a sheltered corner behind the saloon skylight, and sat
beside her. “What is it?”

“Lucius you have always been very good to me. All these years that I
have lived in your house as your very sister you never had a word for
me that wasn’t kind …” He interrupted her, laying his hand on hers
which was on the arm of her deck chair:

“Why else, my dear Judy! You and I have always been the best of
friends. And my dear you have never brought anything but sunshine and
sweetness into the house. Your merriment has kept care away from us
whenever he tried to show his nose … Why my dear what is it? There!
You mustn’t cry!” As he spoke he had taken out a folded silk
pocket-handkerchief and was very tenderly wiping her eyes. Judy went
on sobbing a little at moments:

“I have always tried to make happiness, and I have never troubled you
with asking favours, have I?”

“No need to ask, Judy. All I have is yours just as it is Sally’s or
Joy’s.” Suddenly she smiled, her eyes still gleaming with recent
tears:

“I am asking a favour now--by way of a change. Lucius on my
_honour_--and I know no greater oath with you than that--this has been
a perfectly harmless piece of fun. It arose from a remark of that nice
Irish stewardess on the _Cryptic_ that no one was good enough to marry
Joy except one man: the young nobleman whom she had nursed. And she
really came to believe that it would come off. She says she has some
sort of foreknowledge of things.” The Colonel smiled:

“Granted all this, my dear; what is it you want me to do?”

“To do nothing!” she answered quickly. Then she went with some
hesitation:

“Lucius you are so determined when you take up an idea, and I know you
are not pleased with this little joke. You are mixing it up with
honour--the honour that you fight about; and if you go on, it may
cause pain to us all. We are only a pack of women, after all, and you
mustn’t be hard on us.”

“Judy, my dear, I am never hard on a woman, am I?”

“No! Indeed you’re not,” she avowed heartily. “You’re the very
incarnation of sweetness, and gentleness, and tenderness, and chivalry
with them … But then you take it out of the men that cross you!”

“That’s as a gentleman should be, I take it” he said reflectively,
unconsciously stroking his white moustache. Then he said briskly:

“Now Judy seriously tell me what you wish me to do or not to do. I
must have _some_ kind of clue to your wishes, you know.” As she was
silent for the moment he went on gravely. “I think I understand, my
dear. Be quite content, I take it all for a joke and a joke between us
it shall remain. But I must speak to Joy about it. There are some
things which if used as subjects for jokes lead to misunderstandings.
Be quite easy in your mind. You know I love my daughter too well to
give her a moment’s pain that I can spare her. Thank you Judy for
speaking to me. I might have misunderstood and gone perhaps too far.
But you know how sensitive--‘touchy’ Joy calls it--about my name and
my family I am; and I hope you will always bear that in mind. And
besides my dear, there is the other gentleman to be considered. He
too, may have a word to say. As he is a nobleman he ought to be
additionally scrupulous about any misuse of his name; and of course I
should have to resent any implication made by him against any member
of my family!”

“Good Lord!” said Judy to herself, as he stood up and left her with
his usual courtly bow. “What a family to deal with. This poor little
joke is as apt to end in bloodshed as not. The Colonel is on the
war-path already; I can see that by his stateliness!”

Colonel Ogilvie thought over the matter for a whole day before he
spoke to Joy; he was always very grave and serious regarding subjects
involving honour and duty.

Joy knew that he had something on his mind from his abstraction, and
rather kept out of his way. This was not on her own account for she
had no idea that she was involved in the matter, but simply because it
was her habit to sympathise with him and to think of and for him. She
was just a little surprised when the next afternoon he said to her as
they stood together at the back of the wheel-house over the screw, the
quietest place on the ship for a talk:

“Joy dear, I want you to listen to me a minute.”

“Yes, Daddy!”

“About that joke you had on the _Cryptic_.”

“Yes, Daddy.” She was blushing furiously; she understood now.

“My dear, I don’t object to your having any little harmless romance of
that kind. I don’t suppose it would make any difference if I did. A
young girl will have her dreaming quite independent of her old daddy.
Isn’t it so, little girl?”

“I suppose so, dear Daddy, since you say it.” She nestled up close to
him comfortably as she spoke: this was nicer talk than she expected.

“But there is one thing that you must be careful about: There must be
no names!”

“How do you mean, Daddy?”

“I gather that there has been a joke amongst some of you as to calling
you the Countess or Lady Athlyne, or some of that kind of foolishness.
My dear child, that is not right. You are not the Countess, nor Lady
Athlyne, nor Lady anything. A name my dear when it is an honourable
one is a very precious possession. A woman must cherish the name she
does possess as a part of her honour.”

“I am proud of my name, Father, very, very proud of it; and I always
shall be!” She had drawn herself upright and had something of her
father’s splendid personal pride. The very use of the word ‘Father’
instead of ‘Daddy’ showed that she was conscious of formality.

“Quite right, little girl. That is your name now; and will in a way
always be. But you may marry you know; and then your husband’s name
will be your name, and you will on your side be the guardian of his
honour. We must never trifle with a name, dear. Those people who go
under an alias are to my mind the worst of criminals.”

“Isn’t that rather strong, Daddy, when murder and burglary and theft
and wife-beating and cheating at cards are about!” She felt that she
was through the narrow place now and could go back to her raillery.
But her father was quite grave. He walked up and down a few paces as
though arranging his thoughts and words. When he spoke he did so
carefully and deliberately:

“Not so, little girl. These, however bad they may be, are individual
offences and are punished by law. But a false name--even in jest, my
dear--is an offence against society generally, and hurts and offends
every one. And in addition it is every one of the sins you have named;
and all the others in the calendar as well.”

“How on earth do you make out that, Daddy?”

“Take them in order as you mentioned them. Murder, burglary, theft,
wife-beating, cheating at cards! What is murder? Killing without
justification! Does not one who approaches another in false guise kill
something? The murderer takes the life; the other kills what is often
more than life: self respect, belief in human nature, faith. One only
kills the body; but the other kills the soul. Burglary and theft are
the same offence differently expressed; theft is the meaner crime that
is all. Well, disguise is the thief’s method. Sometimes he relies on
absence of others, sometimes on darkness, sometimes on a mask,
sometimes on the appearance or identity of some one else. But he never
deals with the normal condition of things; pretence of some kind must
always be his aid. The man, therefore, who relies on pretence, when he
knows that the truth would be his undoing, is a thief.”

“Daddy you argue as well as a Philadelphia lawyer!”

“I don’t believe much in lawyers!” said the old man dryly. “As to
wife-beating!”

“I’m afraid you’ve struck a snag there, Daddy! There isn’t much
pretence about that crime, anyhow!”

“Not at all, my dear. That comes within the category of murder. The
man who descends to that abominable crime would kill the woman if he
dared. He is a coward as well as a murderer, and should be killed like
a mad dog!”

“Bravo! Daddy. I wish there was a man like you to deal with them in
every county. But how about cheating at cards. _That’s_ a poser, I
think!”

“No trouble about that, Joy. It _is_ cheating at cards.”

“How do you argue that out, Daddy?”

“Any game of cards is a game of honour. So many cards, so much skill
in playing them according to the recognised rules of the game; and,
over all, a general belief in the honour of all the players. I have
seen a man shot across a handkerchief--in honourable duel, my
dear--for hesitating markedly at poker when he stood pat on a ‘full
house.’ That was pretence, and against the laws of honour; and he paid
for it with his life.” Joy wrinkled her brows; “I see it’s quite
wrong, father, but I don’t quite see how it fits into the argument,”
she said.

“That is simple enough, daughter. As I say, it is a pretence. Don’t
you see that after all a game of cards is a simple thing compared with
the social life of which it is only an occasional episode. If a
man,--or a woman either, Joy--misleads another it must be with some
intention to deceive. And in that deception, and by means of it, there
is some gain--something he or she desires and couldn’t otherwise get.
Isn’t that plain enough!”

“All right, Father; I quite see. I understand now what you mean. I did
not ever look at things in quite that way. Thank you very much, dear,
for warning me so kindly too. I’ll stop the joke, and not allow it to
go on--so far as I can stop it.”

“How do you mean? Does anyone else know it?”

“I may have written to one or two girls at home, Daddy. You know girls
are always fond of such foolishness.”

“Had you not better write to them and tell them not to mention it.”

“Good Gracious! Why you dear, old goose of a Daddy it is evident you
don’t know girls. That would be the very way to make things buzz. Oh
no! we’ll simply drop it; and they’ll soon forget it. I may have to
tell them something else, though, to draw them away from it.”

“Hm!” said her father. She looked at him with a sly archness:

“I suppose, Daddy, it wouldn’t do to have it that an Italian Grand
Duke proposed for me--to you of course!”

“Certainly not, Miss Impudence! I’m not to be drawn into any of your
foolish girls’ chatter. There, run away and let me smoke in peace!”
She turned away, but came back.

“Am I forgiven, Daddy?”

“Forgiven! Lord bless the child, why there’s nothing to forgive. I
only caution. I know well that my little girl is clear grit, straight
through; and I trust her as I do myself. Why Joy, darling” he put his
arm affectionately round her shoulder “you are my little girl! The
only one I have or ever shall have; and so, God willing, you shall be
to me to the end.”

“Thank you dear, dear Daddy. And I pray so too. I shall always be your
little girl to you and shall come to you to cheer you or to be
comforted myself. Mother has of late taken to treating me like a
grown-up which she always keeps firing off at me so that I don’t know
whether I am myself or not. But whatever I am to anyone else, I never
shall be anything to you but your ‘little girl!’”

And that compact was sealed then and there with a kiss.


Nine months later whilst Colonel Ogilvie was in the library of his own
house, “Air” in Airlville, Joy came in and closed the door carefully;
she came close and whispered:

“Am I still your little girl, Daddy?”

“Always my dear! always!”

“Then you don’t mind having a secret with me?”

“_Mind_ my dear! I love it. What is it you want to tell me?” She took
a folded newspaper from her pocket and handed it to him, saying:

“I came across this in the New York _Tribune_. Read it!” Colonel
Ogilvie turned it over with a rueful look as he said:

“The whole of it!”

“Oh Daddy, don’t be tiresome; of course not.” Her father’s face
brightened:

“Then you read what you want me to know. Your eyes are better than
mine!” Joy at once began to read:

“From our own Correspondent, Capetown. Some details of the lamentable
occurrence at de Hooge’s Spruit which was heliographed from the front
yesterday have now come to hand. It appears that a battery of field
artillery was ordered to proceed from Bloomgroot to Neswick escorted
by a Squadron of mixed troops taken from the Scottish Horse and the
Mounted Yeoman. When they had begun to cross the river, which here
runs so rapidly that great care has to be observed lest the horses
should be swept away, a terrific fusillade from an entrenched force of
overwhelming numbers was opened on them. Colonel Seawright who
commanded ordered a retreat until the disposition of the enemy could
be ascertained. But before the manœuvre could be effected the British
force was half wiped out. Accurate fire had been concentrated on the
artillery horses, and as the guns were all on the river bank ready for
the crossing it was impossible to rescue them. Gallant efforts were
made by the gunners and the cavalry escort, but in the face of the
hail of bullets the only result was a terrible addition to the list of
killed and wounded. Seeing that the ground was partly clear, a number
of Boers crept out of cover and tried to reach the guns. At this our
troops made another gallant effort and the Boers disappeared. Still it
was almost hopeless to try to save the guns. One only of the battery
was saved and this by as gallant an effort on the part of one young
officer as has been as yet recorded in the war. Captain Lord Athlyne”
Here Joy looked up for an instant and saw a frown suddenly darken her
father’s brow--“who was tentatively in command of a yeomanry troop
took a great coil of rope one end of which was held by some of his
men. When he was ready he rode for the guns at a racing pace, loosing
the rope as he went. It was a miracle that he came through the
terrific fire aimed at him by the Boer sharp-shooters. Having gained
the last gun, behind which there was a momentary shelter, he attached
the end of the rope. Then mounting again he swept like a hurricane
across the zone of fire. There was a wild cheer from the British, and
a number of horsemen began to ride out whilst the firing ran along the
front of the waiting line. But the instant the rope was attached the
men began to pull and the gun actually raced along the open space. In
the middle of his ride home the gallant Irishman’s cap was knocked off
by a bullet. He reined up his charger, dismounted and picked up the
cap _and dusted it_ with his handkerchief before again mounting.
Despite their wounds and the chagrin of defeat the whole force cheered
him as he swept into the lines.

“Daddy I call that something like a man! Don’t you?” Her colour was
high and her eyes were blazing. She looked happy when her father
echoed her enthusiasm:

“I do! daughter. That was the action of a gallant gentleman!” There
was a silence of perhaps half a minute. Then Colonel Ogilvie spoke:

“But why, my dear, did you tell this to _me_?”

“I had to tell some one, Daddy. It is too splendid to enjoy all one’s
self; and I was afraid if I told Mother she might not
understand--she’s only a woman you know, and might put a wrong
construction on my telling her, and so worry herself about me. And I
didn’t dare to tell Aunt Judy, for she’s so chock full of romance that
she would have simply gone crazy and chaffed me out of all reason.
There is no holding back Aunt Judy when she is chasing after a
romance! And besides, Daddy dear” here she took his arm and looked up
in his face “I wanted you to know that Lord Athlyne is a gentleman.”
Her father frowned:

“Why should I know--or care?”

“Not on your own part Daddy--but--but only because I want you to. It
is hard to explain, but I think you took a prejudice against him from
the first; and you see it makes it less awkward to be coupled with a
man’s name, when the name and the man are good ones.” The Colonel’s
frown was this time one of puzzlement.

“I’m afraid I don’t understand. You never saw the man. Why should you
dislike less to be coupled with him because he did a brave thing?
Besides, the whole thing is mere nonsense.”

“Of course it is, Daddy. All nonsense. But it is better to be good
nonsense than bad nonsense!”

“Look here daughter--my little girl--I’m afraid you have got or may
get too fond of thinking of that fellow. Take care!”

“Oh, that’s all right, Daddy. He is only an abstraction to me. But
somehow he interests me. Don’t you be worrying about me. I promise you
solemnly that I will tell you everything I hear about him. Then you
can gauge my feelings, and keep tab of my folly.”

“All right; little girl! There can’t be anything very dangerous when
you tell your father all about it.”


It was three months before Joy mentioned the name of Lord Athlyne
again to her father. One morning she came to him as he sat smoking in
the garden at Air. Her eyes were glistening, and she walked slowly and
dejectedly. In her hand she held a copy of the New York _Tribune_. She
held it out, pointing with her finger to a passage.

“Read it for me, little girl!” In answer she said with a break in her
voice:

“You read it, Daddy. Don’t make me. It hurts me; and I should only
break down. It is only a dream I know; but it is a sad dream and is
over all too soon!” Colonel Ogilvie read the passage which was an
account of the fighting at Durk River in which numbers of the British
were carried away by the rapid stream, the hale and those wounded by
the terrible fire of the Boers alike. The list of the missing was
headed by a name he knew.

“Major the Earl of Athlyne, of the Irish Hussars.”

The old gentleman rose up as stiff as at the salute and raised his hat
reverently as he said:

“A very gallant gentleman. My heart is with you, my little girl! A
dream it may have been; but a sad ending to any dream!”


A week after Joy sought her father again, in the garden. This time her
step was buoyant, her face radiant, and her eyes bright. The moment
her father saw he felt that it had something to do with what he called
in his own mind “that infernal fellow.” When she was close to him she
said in a low voice that thrilled:

“He is not dead, Daddy! He was wounded and carried down the river and
was captured by the Boers and taken up to Pretoria. They have put him
in the Birdcage. Beasts! It’s all here in the _Tribune_.”

Colonel Ogilvie was distinctly annoyed. When he could look on Lord
Athlyne as dead he could admire his bravery, and even tolerate the
existence that had been. But this chopping and changing--this being
dead and coming to life again--was disturbing. What sort of fellow was
he that couldn’t make up his mind on any subject? Couldn’t he remain
dead like a gentleman? He had died like one; wasn’t that enough! Joy
saw that he was not pleased. She was too glad for the moment to take
her father’s attitude to heart; but every instinct in her told her not
to remain. So she laid the paper on his knee and said quietly:

“I’ll leave it with you, Daddy. You can read it yourself; it’s worth
reading. You are glad, I know, because your little girl is glad that
there is one more brave man in the world.”

Just as she was going her father called her back. When she was close
he said in a kindly manner but with great gravity:

“No more mentioning names now, little girl!” She put her finger to her
lip as registering a vow of secrecy. Then she blew a kiss at him and
tripped away.




 CHAPTER IV.
 THE BIRD-CAGE

The “Bird-cage” at Pretoria was the enclosure wherein the captured
British officers were imprisoned during the second quarter of the year
1900. Here at the beginning of May two men were talking quietly as
they lay on the bare ground in the centre of the compound. The
Bird-cage was no home of luxury; but the men who had perforce to live
in it tried to make the best of things, and grumbling was tacitly
discountenanced. These two had become particular chums. For more than
a month they had talked over everything which seemed of interest. At
first of course it was the war and all connected with it which
interested them most. They were full of hope; for though six months of
constant reverses were behind them they could not doubt that Time and
General Roberts would prevail. These two items of expected success
were in addition to the British Army generally and the British
soldier’s belief in it. When every battle or engagement which either
of them had been in had been fought over again, and when their
knowledge of other engagements and skirmishes had come to an end they
fell back on sport. This subject held out for some time. The memories
of both were copious of pleasant days and interesting episodes; and
hopes ran high of repetitions and variations when the war should be
over and the Boers reduced to that acquiescence in British methods and
that loyalty to the British flag which British pride now demanded.
Then “woman” had its turn, and every flirtation with the bounds of
memory was recalled, without names or identification marks.

Then, when they knew each other better, they talked of the future in
this respect. Young men, whatever exceptions these may be, are very
sentimental. They are at once imaginative and reticent. Unlike girls
their bashfulness is internal. The opening of their hearts, even in a
measure, to each other in this respect was the crowning of their
confidence. At this time they were occasionally getting letters. These
had of course gone through the hands of the censor and their virginity
thus destroyed; but the craving of all the prisoners for news of any
kind, from home or elsewhere, was such that every letter received
became in a measure common property. Even from intimate letters from
their own womenkind parts were read out that had any colourable
bearing on public matters. A few days before one of the men had a
letter from his wife who was in Capetown; a letter which though it was
nothing but a letter of affection from a loving wife, was before the
day was over read by every man in the place. It had puzzled the
husband at first, for though it was in his wife’s writing the manner
of it was not hers. It was much more carefully written than was her
wont. Then it dawned on him that it had a meaning. He thought over it,
till in a flash he saw it all. It was written by her, but she had
copied it for some one else and signed it. The passage of the letter
that now most interested him read:


“I do so long to see you, my darling, that if I do not see you before,
I am going to ask to be allowed to come up to Pretoria and see you
there if I may, if it is only a glimpse through that horrid barbed
wire netting that we hear of. You remember my birthday is on Waterloo
day; and I am promising myself, as my birthday treat, a glimpse of the
face of my dear husband.”


It did not do to assemble together, for the eyes of the jailors were
sharp and an organized meeting of the prisoners was suspicious and
meant the tightening of bonds. So one by one he talked with his
fellows, telling them what he thought and always imploring them to
maintain the appearance of listless indifference which they had
amongst themselves decided was the attitude best calculated to avert
suspicion. Some did not at first understand the cryptic meaning; but
the general belief was that it was a warning that the capture of
Pretoria was expected not later than the fifteenth of June. This
created enormous hopes. Thenceforth all the talk in private was as to
what each would do when the relief came.

To-day the conversation was mainly about Athlyne’s affairs. He had
been unfolding plans to his friend Captain Vachell of the Yeomanry and
the latter asked him suddenly:

“By the way, Athlyne, are you married.”

“What!--Me married! Lord bless you man, no! Why do you ask?”

“I gathered so from what you have been saying just now. Don’t be
offended at my asking; but I have a special purpose.”

“I’m not a bit offended; why should I be? Why do you ask me?”

“That’s what I want to tell you. But old chap this is a delicate
subject and I want to clear the ground first. It is wiser.” Athlyne
sat up:

“Look here, Vachell, this is getting interesting. Clear away!” The
other hesitated and then said suddenly:

“You never went through a ceremony of marriage, or what professed to
be one, with anyone I suppose? I really do ask pardon for this.”

“Honestly, Vachell, I’m not that sort of man. I have lots of sins on
me; more than my fair share perhaps. But whatever I have done has been
above board.” The other went on with dogged persistence:

“You will understand when I explain why I ask; but this is your
matter, not mine, and I want to avoid making matters still more
complicated. That is of course if there should be any complication
that you may have overlooked or forgotten.”

“Good God! man, a marriage is not a thing a man could overlook or
forget.”

“Oh that’s all right with a real marriage; or even with a mock
marriage if a man didn’t make a practice of it. But there might be
some woman, with whom one had some kind of intrigue or irregular
union, who might take advantage of it to place herself in better
position. Such things have been you know, old chap!” he added
sententiously. Athlyne laughed.

“Far be it from me to say what a woman might or might not do if she
took it into her pretty head; but I don’t think there’s any woman who
would, or who would ever think she had the right to, do that with me.
There are women, lots of them I am afraid, who answer the bill on the
irregular union or intrigue side; but I should certainly be astonished
if any of them ever set out to claim a right. Now I have made a clean
breast of it. Won’t you tell me what all this is about?” The other
looked at him steadily, as though to see how he took it, as he
answered:

“There is, I am told, a woman in New York who is passing herself off
as your wife!”

Athlyne sprang to his feet and cried out:

“What!”

“That’s what I took it to mean! By the way--” this was said as if it
was a sudden idea “I take it that your mother is not alive. I had it
in my mind that she died shortly after you were born?”

“Unhappily that is so!”

“There is no dowager Countess?”

“Not for more than thirty years. Why?”

“The letter says ‘Countess of Athlyne.’ I took it to be your wife.”

“Let me see the letter.” He held out his hand. Vachell took from his
pocket--the only private storage a man had in the Bird-cage--an
envelope which he handed to his comrade, who took from it a torn
fragment of a letter. He read it then turned it over. As he did so his
eyes lit up; he had seen his own name. He read it over several times,
then he looked up:

“Have you read it?”

“Yes. I was told to do so.”

“All right! Then we can discuss it together.” He read it out loud:

“So Athlyne is married. At least I take it so, for there is a woman in
New York, I am told, who calls herself the Countess of Athlyne. I know
nothing of her only this: a casual remark made in a gossipy letter.”

“Now tell me, Vachell, can you throw any light on this?”

“Not on the subject but only on the way it has come to you. I had
better tell you all I know from the beginning.” Athlyne nodded, he
went on:

“Whilst we were in the trenches at Volks Spruit waiting for the attack
to sound, Meldon and I were together--you remember Meldon of the
Connaught Fusiliers?”

“Well! We often hunted together.”

“He asked me that if anything should happen to him I would look over
his things and send them home, and so forth. I promised, but I asked
him why he so cast down about the fight that was coming; was it a
presentiment or anything of that kind. ‘Not a bit,’ he said, ‘it’s not
spiritualism but logic! You see it’s about my turn next. All our lot
have been wiped out, going up the line in sequence. Rawson, my junior,
was last; and now I come on. And there is a message I want you to
carry on in case I’m done for. You will find among my papers an
envelope directed to Lord Athlyne. It has only a scrap of paper in it
so I had better explain. The last time I saw Ebbfleet of the
Guards--in Hospital just before he died--he asked me to take the
message. ‘You know Athlyne’ he said ‘I got a letter saying a woman in
New York was calling herself his wife, and as I know he is not married
I think it only right that he should know of this. It will put him on
his guard.’ Well you know poor Meldon went under at Sandaal; and so I
took over the message. When you and I met up here I thought we were in
for a long spell and as we couldn’t do anything I came to the
conclusion that there was no use giving you one more unpleasant thing
to think of and grind your teeth over. But now that we know Bobs and
Kitchener are coming up before long I want to hand over to you. It is
evident that they expect us to be ready to help the force from within
when they come, or else they wouldn’t run the chance of telling us.
Four thousand men, even without arms, are not to be despised in a
scrimmage. If the wily Boer tumbles to it they will take us up the
mountains in several sections, and I may not have another chance.”

“That is all you know of the matter I take it?”

“Absolutely! Of course should I hear anything more I shall at once let
you know. Though frankly I don’t see how that can be; both men who
sent the message are dead. I haven’t the faintest idea of who sent the
original report. Of course, old chap, I am mum on the subject unless
you ever tell me to speak.”

“Thanks, old man. I fancy there won’t be much time for looking after
private affairs for a good spell to come after we have shifted our
quarters. There will be a devil of a lot of clearing up when the house
changes hands and continues to ‘run under new management,’ as Bung
says.”


All that had been spoken of came off as arranged by the various
parties. On the fifth of June Roberts took Pretoria in his victorious
march. Mafeking and Ladysmith had been relieved, and Johannesberg had
fallen. Now, Kruger and the remainder of his forces were hurrying into
the Lydenburg mountains to make what stand they could; and not the
least keen of their foes were those who had been their guests in the
Bird-cage. Athlyne rejoined his regiment and was under Buller’s
command till the routed army escaped into Portuguese territory. Then
he was sent by Kitchener along the ranges of block houses whose
segregations slowly brought the war to an end.

When his turn came for going home three years had elapsed. London and
his club claimed him for his spells of his short leave, for there was
still much work to be done with his regiment. When he began to tire of
the long round of work and distractions he commenced to think
seriously of a visit to America.

His experience of the war had sobered him down. He was now thirty-two
years of age, the time when most men, who have not arrived there
already, think seriously of settling down to matrimony. In other
respects he wanted to be free. He was tired of obeying orders; even of
giving them. The war was over and Britain was at peace with the world.
Had there been still fighting going on anywhere such thought would not
have occurred to him; he would still have wanted to be in the thick of
it. But the long months of waiting and inactivity, the endless
routine, the impossibility of doing anything which would have an
immediate effect; all these things had worn out much of his patience,
and stirred the natural restlessness of his disposition. At home there
seemed no prospect of following soldiering in the way he wished: some
form in which excitement had a part. Indeed the whole scheme of War
and Army seemed to be shaping themselves on lines unfamiliar to him.
The idea of the old devil-may-care life which had first attracted him
and of which he had had a taste did not any longer exist, or, if it
existed it was not for him. Outside actual fighting the life of a
soldier was not now to consist of a series of seasonable amusements.
And even if it did the very routine of amusements not only did not
satisfy him, but became irksome. What, after all, he thought, was to a
grown man a life of games in succession. Polo and cricket, fishing,
shooting, hunting in due course; racquets and tennis, yachting and
racing were all very well individually. But they did not seem to lead
anywhere.

In fact such pastimes now seemed inadequate to a man who had been
actively taking a part in the biggest game of them all, war!

When once the idea had come to him it never left him. Each new
disappointment, the unfulfilled expectation of interest, drove it
further and further home. There was everywhere a lack of his old
companions; always a crowd of new faces. The girls he had known and
liked because they were likable, had got married within the few years
of his absence. The matrons had made fresh companionships which held
possession. Bridge had arisen as a new society fetish which drew to
itself the interests and time of all. A new order of “South African
Millionaires” had arisen who by their wealth and extravagance had set
at defiance the old order of social caste, and largely changed the
whole scheme of existing values.

When he fled away from London he found something of the same changes
elsewhere. In the stir of war, and even in the long weariness of
waiting which followed it, the whirling along of the great world was,
if not forgotten, unthought of. The daily work and the daily interest
were so personal and so absorbing that abstract thinking was not.

In the country, of course, the changes were less, but they were more
marked. The few years had their full tally of loss; of death, and
decay. The eyes that saw them were so far fresh eyes, that unchecked
memory had not a perpetual ease of comparison.

For a while he tried hard to find a fresh interest in his work. But
here again was change with which he could feel neither sympathy nor
toleration. Great schemes of reform were on foot; schemes of
organization, of recruiting, of training. The ranks in the Service, of
which he had experience, were becoming more mechanical than ever. Had
he by this time acquired higher rank in the army it is possible that
he would have entered with ardour into the new conditions. He was
fitted for such; young, and energetic, and daring. Those in the
Cabinet or in the Army Council have material for exercising broader
views of the machinery of war, and to the eyes of such many things
which looked at in detail seem wrong or foolish stand out in their
true national importance.

His dissatisfaction with the army changes was the last straw. He took
it into his head that in future the army had no place for him. The
idea multiplied day by day with an ever-increasing exasperation. At
last his mind was definitely made up. He sent in his papers; and in
due time retired.

It is generally the way with human beings that they expect some
radical change in themselves and their surroundings to follow close on
some voluntary act. They cannot understand, at once at all events,
that the “eternal verities” are eternal. “I may die but the grass will
grow” says Tennyson in one of his songs. And this is the whole story
in epitome. After all, what is one life, howsoever perfect or noble it
may be, in the great moving world of fact. The great Globe floats in a
sea of logic which encompasses it about everywhere. What is ordained
is ordained to an end, and no puny hopes or fears or wishes of an
individual can sway or change its course. Conclusions follow premises,
results follow causes. We rebel against facts and conditions because
they are facts and conditions. Then for some new whim or purpose
entirely our own we take a new step--forward or backward it matters
not--and lo! we expect the whole world with its million years of slow
working up to that particular moment to change too.

This belief that things _must_ change in accordance with our desires
has its base deep down in our nature. At the lowest depth it is
founded on Vanity. We are so important to ourselves that we cannot but
think that that importance is sustained through all creation.

For a little while Lord Athlyne tried to persuade himself that now, at
last, he was enjoying freedom. No more parades or early hours; no more
orderly rooms or mess dinners, or duties at functions; no more of the
bald, stale conventionalities of an occupation which had lost its
charm. He expected each day to be now joyous with the realization of
ancient hopes.

But the expectations were not realized. The days seemed longer than
ever, and he actually yearned for something to fill up his time.
Naturally his thoughts turned, as in the case of sportsmen they ever
do, on big game. The idea took him and he began to plan out in his
mind where he would go. Africa for lions? No! no! He had had enough of
Africa to last him for some time. India for tigers; the Rockies for
bear?

Happy thought. Bear would just suit. He could put in two things: look
up that woman in New York who claimed to be his wife and silence her.
He wouldn’t like such an idea to go abroad in case he should ever
marry. Then he would go on to the Rockies or Colorado and have a turn
at the grizzlies.

He went straightway into the reading room of the club he was in and
began to study Bradshaw.

At last he had found a new interest in life. For a week he devoted
himself to the work in hand, until his whole sporting outfit was
prepared. Then he began to think of the other quest; and the more he
thought of it the more it puzzled him.




 CHAPTER V.
 AN ADVENTURE

With regard to his quest after his alleged wife the first conclusion
Lord Athlyne came to was that he must go incognito--“under an alias”
he expressed it to himself. Otherwise he would give warning of his
presence, and that was the very thing which he wished to avoid. The
woman must be an unscrupulous one or she would not have entered on
such a scheme of fraud; and she would naturally be quick to protect
herself by concealment or flight. An ordinary individual would have
left such an investigation to his solicitors who would have procured
the services of local detectives. But then Athlyne was not an ordinary
individual. He liked to do things for himself in most matters which
interested him; and in this case there was so distinctly a personal
bearing that he would not have been satisfied to leave it to any one
else.

When, however, he began to work out details of his alias he found that
he had landed in a perfect hornet’s nest of difficulties. The mere
matter of clothing and luggage was, he found, almost enough to turn
his hair prematurely grey. What was the use of taking a false name
when his true one was engraved on the brass plates of his portmanteaux
and bags so that every porter would know everything about him within
five minutes of his arrival; the chambermaid and laundress would see
the marking of his linen. He very soon found that he would have to set
about this branch of his effort very systematically if he did not want
to give himself away hopelessly even before he started. He had already
come to the conclusion that he must not take a valet with him. It
would be quite enough to support an alias amongst his equals, whose
habits and breeding had at least a certain amount of reticence,
without running the risk of the world of servants who were much more
inquisitive than their employers and much more skilled in matters of
suspicion and detection.

First he had to decide on the name, and to get familiar with it in all
sorts of ways; speaking, writing, and hearing it spoken. The latter he
could only effect by hearing his own voice; he was conscious that he
must, for some time at all events, be open to the danger of a
surprise. He shrank in a certain way from using a name not his own; so
he salved his conscience by selecting two of the simplest of his many
names. Thus he became for his own purposes Richard Hardy. He fixed his
domicile as “Sands End,” a small place in the middle of Wiltshire
which he had inherited from his mother. It was too small to be
included in his ‘list of seats’ in Debrett, and thus answered his
purpose. Then he got quite fresh store of linen from a new shop and
had it marked ‘R. Hardy’ or ‘R. H.’ He bought new trunks and kit of
all kinds. He had them marked with the same letters, and sent to a
lodging which he had taken for the purpose under his new name. He had
cards printed and got plain notepaper as he had to avoid a crest. Then
he found that all his sporting things, which had already been packed,
had to be unpacked and overhauled lest the real name should remain
anywhere. When all this was done, and it took weeks to complete, he
began to feel an unmitigated fraud and a thorough scoundrel. To a man
who takes honour to be a part of a gentleman’s equipment any form of
dissimulation must always be obnoxious.

One person alone he took into his confidence: his solicitor. It was
necessary that he should have a bank account opened in New York. Also
that in case of any unforeseen accident it would be at least advisable
to be able to explain his actions. When the solicitor remonstrated he
explained his purpose and made a special request that he should not be
subjected to any opposition. “I go to protect myself” he said. The
other shrugged his shoulders and remained silent. He arranged before
he terminated the interview that his letters should be sent to him
under cover to his new name at his bankers in New York. In due time an
account for a large sum was opened there. Then, when all was as
complete as he could think of, he took a cabin in one of the French
boats as he thought that in a foreign ship he would run less risk of
running up against some acquaintance than would be likely on a British
or American vessel.

He had hardly got clear of land when he began to realize in what a
false position he had placed himself. He felt that any
acquaintanceship which he could make might possibly lead to some
imbroglio. To those who took him in good faith and made friends he
must either reveal his purpose or accept a false position from which
he might never be able to extricate himself. As the former was
impossible, without creating a suspicion which would destroy his
purpose, he had to take chance for the latter. The result was that had
to be aloof and unresponsive to any of the proffered friendlinesses of
the voyage; and seeing this the other passengers did not press
friendliness on him or even repeat their overtures. He felt this
acutely, for he had been always in the habit of making friends. Such
is one of the delights of travel, as all know who have been about the
world. Those who once “rub shoulders” in a casual way often make
acquaintanceships which ripen into friendship and are life-long.
Perhaps this is from the fact that in such cases each is taken from
the first on his personal merits. There being no foreknowledge there
cannot be any premeditation of purpose of gain of any kind. Like meets
like, recognises natural kinship; and union is the result.

When after a somewhat tedious and uneventful voyage he landed in New
York he was altogether in a disappointed and a discontented frame of
mind. The acute cause of this was the filling up of the immigration
paper which is so exhaustive as to details as to become inquisitorial.
The answering of each question seemed to him like telling a lie--as
indeed it was. As, however, he had nothing to declare and was without
obvious objection he had no trouble. The only effect from the Customs
examination that he noticed on himself was that when he drove out of
the gates he felt somewhat as he had done when he passed from the
prison pen at Pretoria into the cheering ranks of the victorious
British army. He was lucky enough to escape from the ranks of the
journalists who make copy out of any stranger of distinction who
lands. His name was not sufficiently striking to even attract
attention. He took quiet rooms high up in the “Manhattan,” and for two
days kept his own company.

The third day he went out. He walked through street after street; took
trolley-cars now and again; went “up town” and “down town” on the
road. Crossed the ferries to New Jersey and Long Island. Lunched at
Martin’s and dined at Delmonico’s; and returned to his hotel without
having made so far as he knew a step towards discovery. The only thing
which he brought back was a slight knowledge of local geography. He
had seen something of New York--from the streets; but except to ask
his way from policemen or for food from foreign waiters he had not
spoken to anybody.

The next few days he spent in walking about the streets. In summing up
this afternoon he came to the conclusion that there was, for him,
nothing so bad in Pretoria. All the time he felt with increasing force
that he was a fraud, and constantly found himself evolving schemes as
to how he could shed his incognito. The question of clubs alone made
him unhappy. He had always been a clubbable man; in London he belonged
to a number of the best. Whenever he had been in any city where there
was a club its doors had always through the forethought of some friend
been thrown open to him. Here was a city so full of those masculine
refuges that it might be called the “City of Clubs.” In every
fashionable street was at least one, palatial places where men who
were of the great circle met their friends. And yet he felt like the
Peri outside the gates of Paradise. The feeling grew on him that he
could not enter any one of them, even if he got the chance. How could
he explain to men that he was not what he seemed--what he professed to
be. Club-land is in some ways to men holy ground. Here they can afford
to be natural--to be true. Except the club laws, written or unwritten,
there is no conventional demand. As a man who had grown old knowing
little of any other life put it; “In a club you can afford not to
lie.” (It is to be presumed, by the way, that the speaker did not take
a part in the conversations regarding episodes of fishing or _bonnes
fortunes_!)

He could not see any way in which he could even _begin_ to make his
inquiry; or he could get honestly within any house he had seen. He
became sorry he had ever thought of making the inquiry himself--that
he had ever come at all. Dimly at the back of his thoughts was an
intention to go back to London, resume his proper name, and then
perhaps return in an upright way--as a gentleman should. Still he was
a masterful man and did not like giving up… He thought a ride would
do him good; it would clear his mind and freshen him up. A horseman is
never lonely so long as he has a horse.

He asked the hotel clerk where he would get one. The man gave him
several addresses. Then he added:

“By the way do you want to buy or only to hire?”

“Either. I should buy if I could get something exceptionally good.”

“Then take my advice. Go up to Seventh Avenue right at the top near
the Park. There is an auction there this morning of fine horses. You
will I daresay get what you want; but you will doubtless have to pay
for it.”

“I don’t mind that!” he smiled as he spoke; he did not remember that
he had smiled since he left London. The very prospect of a horse
brightened him up.

Before going to the Auction he called at the bank and drew out a
handsome sum. In horse buying ready money is often a matter of
importance.

At the Horse Exchange there was a good show, some of the horses being
of real excellence. Prices ran high for these, and competition was
spirited. But he got what he wanted: a big “Blue Grass” thoroughbred
well up to his weight. His warranty was complete. The Auctioneer at
his request brought to him presently a livery man on whom he might, he
said, depend; and with him he arranged for the proper keeping of the
horse.

For a few days Athlyne was really happy. His horse was as good as it
looked, and had evidently been trained by some one who understood him.
His mouth was as fine as possible and he realized an inflexion of the
voice. Lord Athlyne rode well, and he knew it; and the horse knew it
too from the first moment when his hand touched the bridle. After the
first ride up the Riverside Drive the two became understanding
friends.

The effect of the exercise on Lord Athlyne was to do away with his
intention of trying to discover the identity of the offending lady. He
would start soon for the Rockies and get after the grizzlies. Or
better still he would go home, shake off his alias, and return--a free
man.

On the Sunday afternoon he went for a ride in the direction he liked
best, up the Riverside Drive. He went quietly till he got near the
University where there was a long stretch of proper riding ground.
There he let the black horse go, and the noble beast went along at a
splendid pace. It was still a little early, and though there were a
good many pedestrians there were but few persons in carriages or
“horsebacking” and so the “ride” was fairly free. Horse and man were a
noble pair. The one jet black, full of fire and mettle, every movement
charged with power and grace; the other tall and slim, hard as nails
with his long spell of South African soldiering, sitting like a
centaur. Man and horse together moved as one. All eyes were turned on
them as they swept by, with admiring glances from both women and men,
each in their respective ways. Two park policemen, a sergeant and a
roundsman, both finely mounted, were jogging quietly along. As the
black horse came dashing up the roundsman said:

“Shall I stop him, sergeant?” The other looked on admiringly and
answered quietly:

“Guess not! ’Twould be a burnin’ shame to stop them two. An there
won’t be any need neyther, _they_ know what they’re doin, Halloran.
They ain’t goin’ to ride down nobody. Did ye iver see a finer seat.
I’d bet that’s an English cavalry man. Look at the spring of him. Be
the Lord I’d like to be in his shoes this minute!”

Amongst the few riders Athlyne passed on his course were an old man
and a young woman. The man tall with a big white moustache, a haughty
bearing, and steely eyes under shaggy white brows. The girl tall and
slim and graceful with black hair and big gray eyes. Both were fairly
well mounted, but the girl’s mare was restive and shying at anything.
As the black horse came thundering along she had to use considerable
skill and force to keep her from bolting. Athlyne had just time for a
passing glance as he swept by; but in that instant the face and figure
became photographed on his memory. The girl turned and looked after
him; she was in the receptive period of her young womanhood when every
man has a charm, and when such a noble figure as was now presented is
a power. With a sigh she turned and said to her companion:

“That is the horse that we saw sold at the Horse Exchange. I was
jealous of whoever bought it then. I’m not now; a man who can ride
like that deserves him. Daddy, don’t you think he is something like
what a man ought to be? I do!”

“You’re right, little girl! But you’d better not say things like that
to any one else but me; they mightn’t understand!” Joy made no answer
but she smiled to herself. During the hour or two that followed she
chatted happily with her father. They had occasional canters and
gallops until the road got too crowded when they went along more
sedately. Whenever her father suggested turning homeward she always
pleaded for one more turn:

“Just one more, Daddy. It is so delightful here; and the river is so
lovely.” Of course she had her way. The old man found more true
happiness in pleasing her than in any other way. In her heart, though
she did not tell her father for she felt that even he mightn’t
understand, she had a wish that the man on the black horse would
return the same way. She had a feeling that he would.


After his gallop Athlyne went quietly along the road past Grant’s Tomb
and followed the course of the Drive. Here the road descended,
circling round the elevation on which the Tomb is erected. Below it is
the valley of some old watercourse into the Hudson. This valley has
been bridged by a viaduct over which the Drive continues its course up
the side of the river for many miles. To-day however, it was necessary
to make a detour, descend the steep on the hither side of the valley
and rise up the other side. Some settlement had affected the base of
the up-river end of the bridge and it had given way. The rock on which
New York is based is of a very soft nature, and rots slowly away, so
that now and again a whole front of a house will slide down a slope,
the underlying rock having perished. Not long before, this had
actually happened to a group of houses in Park Row. Now the bridge had
fallen away; the road ended abruptly, and below lay a great shapeless
mass of twisted metal and stone. The near end of the viaduct was
barred off with wooden rails, and in the centre was a great board with
a warning that the thoroughfare was closed.

Athlyne rode up as far as the Up-Town Club, sat for awhile amongst the
trees on the river bank and thought of many things. Amongst these of
the girl with the gray eyes who looked so admiringly at his horse--or
himself. Perhaps he accepted the latter alternative, for as his
thoughts ran he smiled and stroked his big moustache.

When he rode towards town again he kept a sharp look out,
unconsciously slackening speed when any old man and young woman riding
together came in sight. He had ascended the eastern side of the
valley, over which lay the broken viaduct, and commenced to traverse
the curved slope leading up to Grant’s Tomb when he heard a sudden
shouting on the road in front and saw a rush of people to both sides
and up the steps to the Tomb. An instant after a mounted constable
appeared urging his horse to a gallop as he cried out:

“Clear the road! Clear the road! It’s a run-a-way!” Instinctively
Athlyne drew to the roadside, a double purpose in his mind; to keep
the way clear as directed, and to be able to render assistance if
possible. The noise and cries drew closer and there was on the hard
road a thunder of many hoof strokes. Then round the curve swept a
brown mare dashing madly in a frenzied gallop--the neck stretched out
and the eyes flaming. The woman who rode her, a tall girl with black
hair and great gray eyes, sat easily, holding her reins so as to be
able to use them when the time should come. She was in full possession
of herself. She did not look frightened, though her face was very
pale. Behind her but a little way off came two mounted policemen and
the old man with the big white moustache. Other men variously mounted
came hurrying in the background; beyond them a whole long series of
horse vehicles and motor cars.

As he saw her Athlyne’s heart leaped. This was the girl whose face had
attracted him; his time had come quicker than he had dared to hope. He
shook his reins and started his horse, spurring him with his heels as
he did so. If he was to be of service he should be able to keep at
least equal pace; and that would require a quick start, for the
runaway was going at a great pace.

And then a great fear fell on him, not for himself but for the girl.
He knew what perhaps she did not, that the viaduct was broken, and
that her course lay down the steep roadway to the bottom of the little
valley. He rode in earnest now; the sloping curved road was so short
that if he was to stop the mare the effort should be made at once. He
rode close by her, his powerful horse keeping pace almost without an
effort, and said quietly to the girl:

“Try to hold her in if ever so little, there is a steep road which you
must go down. The viaduct is broken and the road barred.”

“I can’t,” she said “she has the bit and I am powerless.”

He struck his heels sharply and the black horse bounded forward. The
girl saw the movement and understood:

“Take care” she said quickly. “One policeman tried that and was thrown
over, he may be killed.” As she spoke, the words died on her lips;
they had rounded the curve and the danger ahead lay open to them. It
was a choice of evils: a dash down the steep incline with a maddened
mare, or a crash against the barrier cutting off the viaduct.

But the woman had no choice; the maddened mare took her own course.
Down the curving slope she dashed and went straight for the barrier.
This was made of heavy balks of timber below, but the rails above were
light. These she broke through as she leaped; hurling a cloud of
broken rails and splinters right and left. The girl had nerved herself
to the effort when she had seen what was coming and held up as at a
jump on the hunting field.

The moment that Athlyne had realized the situation he too was ready.
Seeing that the mare was making for the right side of the barrier he
went for the left, and they leaped together. The instant they had
landed on the other side he was ready and rode alongside the mare.
Ahead of them was the chasm--with death beneath. The girl saw it and
her pale face grew ashy white. Athlyne, riding level and holding his
reins in his left hand, hurriedly cried:

“Loose your stirrup and when I get my arm round you take hold of my
collar with your left hand. Then try to jump to me as I pull you
towards me.”

The girl loosened her boot from the stirrup and let go her rein,
bending towards him as his arm went round her waist and catching his
collar as directed.

“Go!” he cried and she sprang towards him as well as she could. He
drew her towards him with all his strength, and in a second the girl
was landed on the pommel of his saddle. She knew what she had to do:
to leave his right hand free, so she clasped both her arms round his
neck. He pulled at his reins with all his might--it was two lives
now--and cried to the horse. The noble animal seemed to understand and
threw himself back on his haunches.

He stopped only a few yards from the open chasm, into which the mare
went with a wild rush.

Athlyne slid from the saddle, holding the girl in his arms. As the
terrible danger came to an end her eyes closed and she sank senseless
to the ground.

Then the deluge!

Through the barrier, which appeared to melt away before them, came a
rush of people. Some were on horseback, some on foot, others in
buggies, carriages, motor cars. Foremost came Colonel Ogilvie who
leaped the broken barrier; then after him a policeman whose horse had
manifestly been trained to timber. At last several mounted police
fearing that some terrible accident might occur from the crowding on
the viaduct ranged themselves in front of the opening and protected it
till the coming of a sufficient number of policemen, on foot and
panting, had arrived to hold it.

Colonel Ogilvie threw himself from his horse and knelt down beside
Joy. When he saw that she was only fainting he stood up and lifted his
hat to her rescuer:

“I don’t know how to thank you, sir,” he said in a voice broken with
emotion. “’Twas a gallant act! Some day, when you have children of
your own, you may understand what it is to me!” Athlyne who was
kneeling, still holding up Joy’s head, said in the disconnected way
usual to such circumstances:

“Do not mention it! It has been a pleasure to me to be of any
service,” and so forth. Then, seeing signs in the girl’s face of
returning animation, he said aloud so as to divert some of the
attention:

“Has any one seen after the mare? The poor brute must be mangled, if
it has not been killed; it ought to be put out of pain.”

The poor brute was indeed a pitiable sight; there was a sigh of relief
from the crowd round it down below when a policeman put it out of pain
with a revolver shot.

Seeing that the lady was now recovering and in the charge of her
father, Athlyne wanted to get away. He hated all such fuss and
publicity. He could not let her go lest she should be hurt, but he
signed to her father who took his place; then he arose. The girl’s
eyelids quivered and she gave a heavy sigh. Then the eyes opened and
she stared wildly at the sea of faces around her. She seemed to recall
everything in an instant, and with a shudder and a violent movement
sprang to her feet.

“Where is he?” she said anxiously. Then, recovering her full presence
of mind and seeing her father, she turned to him and putting her arms
round him began to cry on his shoulder.




 CHAPTER VI.
 TRUE HEART’S-CONTENT

Athlyne’s one idea was now to get away quickly. The crowd was
gathering closely and were beginning to ask questions. One big,
intelligent-looking sergeant of police had out his note-book.

“May I ask your name, sorr?”

“Is that necessary, my good man?”

“Well, we have to report, sorr, but” this he said with a confidential
look “it mayn’t be necessary to make it public. You see, the lady’s
all right, and no one is goin’ to make trouble over a dead horse.
Though why any man would want to keep his name out of the papers for a
deed like _that_, bates me!” Athlyne beckoned him aside; they leaned
against the parapet with their faces towards the river. He had by now
taken out his pocket-book and handed the sergeant a bill with a yellow
back. The man’s eyes opened when he saw it; and there was more than
respect in his voice as he said: “Thank you very much, sorr! Be sure
I’ll do all I can. An’ I don’t know that we can’t pull it off nayther;
but ye must look out for them blasted kodaks!”

“All right sergeant. I’m much obliged for the hint. By the way wasn’t
one of your men tumbled over?”

“Yes, sorr; but I’m tould he wasn’t hurt, only a bruise or two an’ the
skin from off iv his nose.”

“Good! You’ll tell the lady, she is sure to be distressed about him.
Give him this for me, please. And here is my card. I am at the
Manhattan.”

“Thank you again, sorr. ’Tis mighty kind of ye. An’ sorr if I may make
so bould. If ye want not to be in all the paapers to-morra betther not
ride back. There’ll be a million kodaks on the Boulevard.”

Just then a tall man raised his hat to Colonel Ogilvie and said:

“My motor is here, sir, and I shall be very happy if you will use it
for the lady. The chauffeur will leave you where you wish.”

“Thank you exceedingly. I shall be very grateful. I dare say I can get
somebody to bring my horse to the stables; I couldn’t leave my
daughter alone after such a shock.”

“I’ll see to it, sorr,” said the sergeant, who had come close. Colonel
Ogilvie gave him his card and said:

“We are at the Holland House. Come up and see me some time to-morrow
morning. I have some gratitude to express to you and your men!”

Whilst this conversation was going on a slim young man came up to
Athlyne and raising his hat said:

“Can I do anything for you, sir. It will be a pleasure I assure you.”
Athlyne summed him up a glance as a soldier.

“Thanks, old fellow,” he said, impulsively holding out his hand.
“You’re a soldier aren’t you--a cavalry man?”

“No. Field Artillery 27th Battery. But we’re all cavalry at West
Point. I knew you were a soldier when I saw you ride--let alone what
you did. What can I do?”

“If it wouldn’t trouble you too much I wish you’d get some one to
bring my horse to the Exchange in Seventh Avenue. You see I want to
avoid all this fuss and kodaking.”

“I should love to; what a noble animal he is. But I shan’t send him.
If you don’t mind I’ll ride him myself. Catch me missing a ride on a
horse like that. May I come and see you after.”

“Delighted. Manhattan Hotel.” They bowed and parted. Athlyne went to
Colonel Ogilvie, he felt it would be indecorous to leave without a
word.

“I hope your daughter is all right, sir.”

“Thanks to you, my brave friend. I am Colonel Ogilvie of Airlville.
Joy this is Mr. ----” Athlyne felt in an instant like a cad. He
realised now, in all its force, the evil of deception. Silently he
handed his card. “Mr. Hardy” her father said. Joy held out her hand
and he took it.

“I’m not able to thank you, now and here!” she said, raising to him
her glorious grey eyes. He mumbled out a few words in reply and raised
his hat to part. As he was turning away Joy whispered to her father:

“Daddy, won’t you ask him to come to see us. Mother will want to thank
him too. Ask him to come to dinner to-night.”

“My dear, you will be far too upset. Better----”

“Nonsense, Daddy dear. I’m all right now. Indeed, dear, it will seem
strange if you don’t, after what he has done for--for you, Daddy
dear--and for me.”

In his own formal and kindly way Colonel Ogilvie gave the invitation.
Athlyne answered with equal kindly ceremony; and they parted.

By this time the stranger’s motor had been taken in through the broken
barrier. Colonel Ogilvie insisted that their host should not leave
them, and they drove off together.

In the public excitement at their going Athlyne escaped unnoticed. He
took the street at right angles and shortly got a down-town West-End
Avenue car.

An hour later he had a call from his military friend, who announced
himself as “Lootenant R. Flinders Breckenridge.” Athlyne had now made
up his mind how to meet him. He said at once:

“I am going to try your patience, old chap, and perhaps your
friendship; but I want you to keep a secret. I can’t deceive a
comrade; and we military men are that to each other all the world
over. I am here under a false name. I had reasons for keeping my
identity concealed as I came for a special purpose. So I want you to
bear with me and keep even that much a secret between you and me.”

“That’s all right!” said the boy with a hearty smile. “On my honour
I’ll keep your secret as my own.”

“And when I can I’ll write and let you know!” And so a friendship
began.

“Mr. Hardy” left word at the desk that he would not see any one,
especially any newspaper man. But on the Riverside Drive the kodaks
had been hard at work; the black horse was recognised, and the morning
papers had many execrable likenesses of Lootenant Breckenridge as he
appeared galloping.


In the hall of the Holland House Lord Athlyne found Colonel Ogilvie
waiting for him with that old-fashioned hospitality which is still to
be found in the South. He cordially greeted his guest, and when they
had come from the elevator took his arm to lead him into his own
suite. Athlyne was quite touched with the greeting extended to him. He
had not for years been in the way of receiving anything of the nature
of family affection. But now when his host’s warmth was followed by a
tearful gratitude on the part of his wife which found expression of a
quick bending forward and kissing the hand which she held in hers--to
the great consternation of the owner thereof--he was sensible of
feeling foolish.

“Oh, pray! pray!” he said, and then remained silent; for what could he
do but submit gracefully to such an overt outcome of the feelings of a
grateful mother. Joy was a girl in whom were the elements of passion;
was it strange that the same emotional yeast worked in her as in her
mother’s nature.

The introduction to Miss Judith Hayes was a relief. She too felt
strongly; no less strongly when she realised that the valiant stranger
was so handsome and of so distinguished an appearance. But after all
the matter was not so vitally close to her. An aunt, howsoever loving
her nature may be, cannot be actuated by the overwhelming impulses of
motherhood. This very difference, however, made speech easier; she it
was who of all the grateful little party gave best verbal expression
to her feelings. In frank phrases, touched with the native warmth of
her heart and emphasised by the admiring glances of her fine eyes, she
told him of the gratitude which they all felt for his gallant rescue
of her dear niece. She finished up with an uncontrollable sob as she
said:

“If it hadn’t been for your bravery and resource and strength there
would be no more sorrowful band of poor souls in all the wide world
than--than” she turned her head and walked over to the window. Athlyne
could see that for quite a minute or two afterwards her shoulders
shook. When at last she did turn round, her glassy eyes but ill
accorded with her incisive humorous phrases or her ringing laugh. The
effect on Athlyne was peculiar; without analysing the intellectual
process too closely, he felt in his mind with a secret exultation that
he had “found an ally.” It may have been the soldier instinct, to
which he had been so long accustomed, working in his mind; or it may
have had another basis. Anyhow he was content.

His meeting with Joy surprised whilst it satisfied them both. They
looked into each other’s eyes for an instant, and to them both the
whole world became crystal. The “whole world” to them both--their
world--the only world that was to them at that moment, that ever could
be, that had been since the ordination of things. This is the true
heart’s-content. It is the rapture of hearts, the communion of souls.
Passion may later burn the rapture into fixed belief, as the furnace
fixes the painted design on the potter’s clay; but in that first
moment of eyes looking into answering eyes is the dawn of love--the
coming together of those twin halves of a perfect soul which was at
once the conception and realisation of Platonic belief.

At dinner Athlyne was placed between Mrs. Ogilvie and Joy, Colonel
Ogilvie being next his daughter and Miss Hayes next her sister. Thus
Aunt Judy, being opposite both her niece and the guest, could watch
them both without seeming to stare. In the early part of the dinner
she was abnormally, for her, silent; but later on, when she felt that
things were going dully with some of the party, she manifested her
usual buoyancy of spirits. She had in the meantime come to certain
conclusions of her own.

Somehow there was an air of constraint over all the party, but in
different ways and from different causes. Athlyne was ill at ease
because they all made so much of him; and as he was painfully
conscious of his false position in accepting the hospitality of such
persons under an alias, their kindness only emphasised to him his own
chagrin. Colonel Ogilvie conscious, rather by instinct than from any
definite word or action, that his guest was more reticent than he
would have thought a young man would be under the circumstances, was
rather inclined to resent it. The Ogilvies had from the earliest times
been very important people in their own place; and many generations of
them had grown up to the understanding that their friendship, even
their acquaintance, was an honour. Now when he had asked into his
family circle a young man known personally to him only by his visiting
card and by the fact that he had saved his daughter’s life--very
gallantly it was true--he found his friendly interest in his new
acquaintance was not received with equal heartiness. The truth was
that Athlyne was afraid. He felt instinctively that he was not his own
master whilst those great grey eyes were upon him--most certainly not
when he was looking into the mystery of their depths. And so he feared
lest he should become confused and weave himself into a further tangle
of falseness. In the background of his own mind he knew what he
wished--what he intended; that this beautiful grey-eyed girl should
become his wife. He knew that he must first get clear of his false
position; and he was determined at any cost not to let anything
interfere with this. At first Colonel Ogilvie’s allusions to his home
and his place in the world were purely kindly; he thought it only
right, under the circumstances of his great obligation, to show such
an interest as a man of his age might with another so much his junior.
But he could not help feeling that though his guest’s manner was all
that was winning and that though his words were adequate there was no
loosening of the strings of self-possession. Such a thing was new to
the Colonel, and new things, especially those that he could not
understand, were not pleasing to him. Still, the man was his guest;
and only a few hours before had rendered him the greatest service that
one could to another. He must not let him, therefore, feel that there
was any constraint on his part. And so he acted what was to him an
unfamiliar part; that of an exuberant man.

Joy was constrained, for with her deep knowledge of her father’s
character she saw that he was upset by something; and, as that
something could only be in connection with the guest, she was uneasy.
She knew well what her opinion of that guest was; and she had a
feeling of what her hopes would be, dare she give them a voice. But
that must be postponed--till when she should be alone. In the meantime
she wanted to enjoy every moment when that guest was by her side. And
now her breast was stirred with some vague uneasiness.

Mrs. Ogilvie had her own disturbing cause. She could not but see that
her daughter was very much absorbed in this strange gentleman whom she
had not ever even seen till that afternoon, and she wanted to know
more of him before she could allow matters to become more definite.
She knew that he was brave and she could see that he was a gentleman
and a handsome one. But still--A mother’s heart has its own anxieties
about her child. And this mother knew that her child was of no common
nature, but had her own share of passions which might lead her into
unhappiness. Too well from herself she knew the urging of a passionate
nature. Joy had not been tested yet, as she had herself been. She had
not yet heard that call of sex which can alter a woman’s whole life.

As to Judy her sympathy with romance in any form and her love for Joy
acted like the two ingredients in a seidlitz-powder. Each by itself
was placid and innocuous, but when united there was a boiling over. It
needed no spirit come from the grave, or from anywhere else, to tell
her of the power which this handsome, gallant, young man had already
over her niece. A single lifting of the girl’s eyes with that adorable
look which no habit of convenience could restrain; a single lifting or
falling of the silky black lashes; a single sympathetic movement of
the beautiful mouth in its receptive mood as she took in her
companion’s meaning told her all these things and a hundred
others--told her a story which brought back heart-aching reminiscence
of her own youth. She was not jealous, not a particle--honestly and
truly. But after all, life is a serious thing, serious to look back
on, though it seems easy enough to look forward to. The heart knoweth
its own bitterness. “A sorrow’s crown of sorrow is remembering happier
things.”

So far, as to possibilities. Judith was much too clever and too
sympathetic a person to go wrong as to facts on which they were based.
She was a natural physiognomist, like other animals who have learned
to trust their instincts; and within a very few minutes had satisfied
herself as to the worthiness of “Joy’s man”--that is how she tabulated
him in her own mind. She felt quite satisfied as to her own judgment,
not always the case with her. In her own mind, living as she had done
for so long in a little world of her own thoughts, she was in the
habit of arguing out things just as she would were she talking with
some one else, a man for preference. She always wanted to know the
truth, even if she did not use it. She had once said to her sister
when they were considering how they should act with regard to a
scandal in a neighbouring family:

“Well, Sally, it’s all very well not being inquisitive; but you know,
my dear, we can’t begin to lie properly till we know what we are to
lie about. There’s nothing so destructive of after happiness--no
kindliness so full of pitfalls, as a useless lie.”

Now, her argument ran:

“You can’t be all wrong about a man. You have thought too much on the
subject not to be able to form an opinion. And even if your old maid’s
instinct--for you are an old maid, my dear, despite your saying that
you are so to prove that you are not--warps your judgment in favour of
the man. The pride that is in that man’s features never came out of
merely one or two generations of command. It takes a couple of
centuries at any rate to put _that_ stamp on a face. He is bold--well
we know that from to-day’s work; he is courtly--a man doesn’t do nice
things unconsciously, unless it has been his habit. He’s in love with
Joy--no doubt about that; and small blame to him for it. He’s in her
father’s house, an honoured guest as he should be. He’s sitting next
to her and she’s looking straight into his soul with those big lamps
of eyes of hers. He saved her life a few hours ago, and now he can
see--if he’s not a fool and he’s not that whatever else he may
be--that she adores him--and yet he’s not at his ease… What is it?
What does it mean? For Joy’s sake I must find that out. I may have to
lie a bit; but at least I’ll know what I am doing!”

With this object in view she took, when the charm of the meeting began
to lose its lustre, the conversation in hand herself. She felt that
the time had come. Well she understood when she saw on Colonel
Ogilvie’s face the very faintest shade of a shadow of that dark look
which in earlier years had meant trouble for some one. “Lucius is
thinking!” was the way she put it to herself. To a woman of her
bringing up, the acts of the men of the family, and especially of its
head, were not within the women’s sphere. In the old slave-owning
families there was perpetuated something of the spirit of
subordination--some survival of old feudal principle. This was
especially so in everything relating to quarrels or fighting. It was
not women’s work, and women were trained not to take any part in it,
not even to manifest any concern. Indeed the free-spirited Judy having
lived so many years in that particular atmosphere, before being able
to look round her in wider communities, compared the dominance of view
of a man in his own family life to that of a cock who lords it over
the farmyard, struts about masterfully, and summons his household
round him with no other purpose than his own will. Woman-like she was
content to yield herself to the situation.

“We’re all the same,” she once said to a farmer’s wife, “women or
hens. When the master clucks we come!”

As it was quite apparent to her that both her sister and
brother-in-law were uneasy, she began to take on herself the
responsibility of action, even if it should have to be followed by the
odium.

“What’s the use of being an old maid if you can’t do _something_!” she
said to herself as a sort of rallying cry to her own nerves. Such
gathering of one’s courage is not uncommon; it is, in unusual
circumstances, to many men and to most women. It does not as a rule
apply to professional or accustomed duties. To the soldier, the
lawyer, the engineer, the man of commerce, each as such, the faculties
which wait on the intelligence are already braced by habit. And to the
woman in her hours of social self-consciousness the same applies. When
a woman puts on her best frock she is armed and ready as completely as
is the cavalry man with the thunder of the squadron behind him; as the
artillery man when “Action!” has been sounded. Ordinarily Miss Judith
was equal to all demands made on her; now she was engaging in a matter
in which she did not thoroughly understand either the purpose or the
end. Now she spoke:

“Have you been staying long in New York Mr. Hardy?” At the moment
Athlyne was talking with his hostess and did not seem to hear; but Joy
heard and said gently: “Mr. Hardy!” He turned suddenly red, even to
his ears.

“I beg your pardon, I didn’t …” There he stopped, suddenly realizing
that he had almost betrayed himself. The fact was that he heard the
question but forgot for an instant the part he was playing. His ears
had been tuned to the music of Joy’s voice, and he did not wake at
once to the less welcome sound. Partly it was of course due to the
fact that as yet he had heard but little of Aunt Judy’s speech; her
intentional silence had a drawback as well as an advantage. He stopped
his explanation just in time to save suspicion from the rest of the
family, but not from Judy, who having an intention of her own was
alert to everything. She made a mental note to be afterwards
excogitated: “I didn’t--what?”

She repeated the question. He answered with what nonchalance he could:

“No. Only a few days.”

“Do you remain long?”

“I am sorry to say that I cannot. I had promised myself a few weeks
after grizzlies; but that has to be foregone for the present.
Something has happened which requires my going back at once. But I
hope to renew my visit before long.” He was pleased with himself for
the verbal accuracy of the statement, and this reassured him.

“What a pity you have to give up your hunting,” said Colonel Ogilvie,
heartily. “You would find it really excellent sport. I haven’t had any
of it for twenty years; but I’d dearly like to have another turn at it
if I could.”

“What boat do you go by?” asked Mrs. Ogilvie.

“By the French boat. The _Mignonette_ which sails on Saturday.” He
answered with confidence for he had spent a quarter of an hour looking
it up before he had dressed; and had already posted a letter to the
Office asking to have the best cabin open kept for him.

“What a pity,” said Joy. “We are going on the _Graphic_ on the
Wednesday after; you might have come with us.” She coloured up as she
became conscious of the dead silence--lasting for a few seconds--of
the rest of the party.

“H’m!” said the Colonel.

“Perhaps dear, Mr. Hardy has reasons of his own for choosing his own
route,” said Mrs. Ogilvie, determined that her daughter should not
appear to be too ardent in pressing the new acquaintanceship.

Athlyne hastened to set matters right, as well as he could. He knew
from his own bringing up that such a request should come rather from
the parents than from the girl herself; but he understood and tried to
protect her. He addressed himself therefore to Mrs. Ogilvie and not
her daughter as he spoke:

“It would I assure you, be a delight to me to go on your ship. But
unhappily it would not be possible. Some business matters, not
altogether my own, are dependent on my arriving in England. If I had
only known that you were going--Indeed I may say,” he added with a
smile which all three women accepted as “winning” “that if I had
known, to begin with, that such delightful people existed. … But
until that … that accident I had no such knowledge. I must not say
that ‘happy’ accident for it was fraught with such danger to one whom
you hold dear. But, that apart, it _was_ a happy accident to me that
has given me the opportunity of making friends whom I already value so
highly!” This was for him quite a long speech; he breathed more freely
when it was over.

When the ladies had gone, he and his host had a long chat over their
cigars. He was now more at ease, and as the conversation was all about
sport and horses, matters in which he was thoroughly at home, he could
speak more freely and more naturally than he had yet done. There was
not any personal element which would require him to be on guard and so
cause constraint. The result was that Colonel Ogilvie got quite over
his stiffness and began to warm to his genial influence.

It was quite a sign of his existing attitude that he now took on
himself to say just what he had reprehended in his daughter:

“I am really sorry you can’t come on the _Graphic_ with us. It would
make the voyage a new pleasure for us all!” As he spoke he took the
young man’s arm in a most friendly way; and to Joy’s secret delight,
they came in this wise into the drawing-room.




 CHAPTER VII.
 A DISCUSSION

On reflection Lord Athlyne was glad that circumstances had not
allowed him to travel on the _Graphic_ with his new friends. At first
he felt horribly disappointed; as if Fate had in a measure checkmated
him. Had he known that the Ogilvies were to travel on the White Star
boat he could have easily arranged his plans. The voyage would in some
ways--_one_ way--have been delightful. Well he knew that; but as he
should have to keep up his alias he would have been in a perpetual
state of anxiety and humiliation.

This feeling made it easier for him therefore to come to a definite
conclusion regarding his journey home: he would keep to himself, as
far as possible, during the journey and try to get at the earliest
possible moment out of his present humiliating position. Under any
ordinary circumstances he would have gone to Colonel Ogilvie and told
him frankly of the state of matters, relying on his good feeling to
understand and sympathise with his difficulty. Had there been
opportunity for reflection he would have done so; but all was so
hurried at the scene of the accident that there had not been time for
thought. He had accepted of necessity the invitation to dinner. Then,
or before going to the Holland House would have been his chance. But
again the Colonel meeting him and taking him at once to his family
made present explanation difficult. Dinner finished him. When first on
the Drive he had seen Joy he had thought her a beautiful girl. The act
of rescuing her had made her of the supremest interest to him. But it
was not till he had sat beside her and looked into her eyes that he
felt that love had come. No man could look into those beautiful eyes
and remain untouched. But this man, heart-hungry and naturally
susceptible after some years of campaigning, fell madly in love. His
very soul had gone down into the depths of those unfathomable eyes,
and come back purified and sweetened--like the smoke drawn through the
rosewater of a hookah. Every instant that he sat beside her the spell
grew upon him. Joy was a woman in whom the sex-instinct was very
strong. She was woman all over; type of woman who seems to draw man to
her as the magnet draws the steel. Athlyne was a very masculine person
and therefore peculiarly sensitive to the influence. That deep
thinking young madman who committed suicide at twenty-three, Otto
Weininger, was probably right in that wonderful guess of his as to the
probable solution of the problem of sex. All men and all women,
according to him, have in themselves the cells of both sexes; and the
accredited masculinity or femininity of the individual is determined
by the multiplication and development of these cells. Thus the ideal
man is entirely or almost entirely masculine, and the ideal woman is
entirely or almost entirely feminine. Each individual must have a
preponderance, be it ever so little, of the cells of its own sex; and
the attraction of each individual to the other sex depends upon its
place in the scale between the highest and the lowest grade of sex.
The most masculine man draws the most feminine woman, and _vice
versa_; and so down the scale till close to the border line is the
great mass of persons who, having only development of a few of the
qualities of sex, are easily satisfied to mate with any one. This is
the true principle of selection which is one of the most important of
Nature’s laws; one which holds in the lower as well as in the higher
orders of life, zoological and botanical as well as human. It accounts
for the way in which such a vast number of persons are content to make
marriages and even liaisons, which others, higher strung, are actually
unable to understand.

As yet, of course, Joy being a young woman had not her power
developed. Such an unconscious power takes in the course of its
development its own time. Instinct is a directing principle, and
obedience can be given to it in many different ways. With Joy its
course had been slow, the growth of time alone. Up to now there had
been no disturbing element in her life; most of her years had been
spent in a quiet house in a quiet neighbourhood where there were but
few inhabitants of her own class; and where, therefore, the percentage
of eligible men was small. There was even to her, as there must be to
any girl like her, certain protecting oppositions. She was at once
practical and sentimental, sensuous and dainty. Her taste was her
first line of defence to the attacks of the baser qualities of her own
nature. Nothing could appeal to her thoroughly which did not answer
widely divergent conditions. Aunt Judy had summed her up well in
saying that she would, if she ever fell in love, give herself
absolutely. But it must be the right man to whom she did so give
herself; one who must comply with all the conditions which she had
laid down for herself. A girl of her up-bringing--with a father and
mother who adored her each in special way; with an aunt who
represented impulsive youth all the more actively because she
professed the staidness of age which is without hope; and with no
intimate relationships or friendships of the male kind--had not only a
leaning to, but a conviction of romance as a prime factor of life.
“Life” was to her not that which is, but that which is to be. As the
world of the present, where such thoughts are, is not one which is lit
and coloured by love, the world of the future is the World of Love.
The Fairy Prince who is to bring so much happiness--when he comes--is
no mere casual visitor to feminine childhood. He is as real to the
child’s imagination as the things of her waking life, though his
nodding plume has little in common with the material things which
surround her. As she grows older so does he change form, coming more
into harmony with living fact; till at last in some lofty moment,
whose memory is a treasure for after life, the ideal and the real
merge in one.

To Joy the hour had come. The Prince Charming who had swept across her
path in such heroic fashion was all that she had ever longed for. He
was tall and strong and handsome and brave. He was a gentleman with
all a gentleman’s refined ways. He had taste and daintiness, though
they were expressed in masculine ways. He too had love and passion.
How could she not know it who had seen--had felt--his soul sink into
the deeps of her eyes, where mermaid-like her own soul peeping from
behind the foliage of the deep had smiled on him to lead him on. How
could she forget that strong arm which was thrown around her waist and
which tore her from her saddle just in time to save her from a
horrible death. How could she forget the seconds when she hung on to
him for life, her arms clasped around his neck.

Whilst he was beside her at dinner she was in an ecstasy. Every fibre
of her being quivered in response to his. And yet, such is the
influence of teaching and convention, all this did not detract from
her outward calm. When the ladies had left the table she had gone out
with her arm round Aunt Judy’s waist as was the convention of the
time, and her smile had not lost its frank geniality. But in very
truth she did not feel like smiling. She would have given anything to
have stolen away to her own room and have lain on her bed, face down,
and have thought, and thought, and thought. The whole thing had come
on her so suddenly. Even the little preparation which she had had at
the auction--the beautiful horse and the fine-looking masterful man
who had bought him--did not seem to count. As he had swept past her in
the Drive, man and horse seen singly seemed superb; but together a
dream. Still there was nothing to fix it in her mind. There needs some
personal quality to fix a dream; just as the painter requires a
mordant to hold his colours to the canvas. But such luxury of thought
would have to be postponed. It would come, of course--later in the
night when there would be loneliness and silence. So she had to
contain herself, and wait.

When “Mr. Hardy” came back to the drawing-room arm in arm with her
father her heart thrilled. It seemed like a promise of hope if not
hope itself. Aunt Judy, ever watchful, saw and understood. To her
seeing eyes and understanding nature there was no mistaking the
meaning of the girl’s unconscious pantomime--those impulsive
expressions of thought made through the nerves: the eager half turning
of the ear to catch the sound of the opening of the dining room door
and the passing of the feet in the passage way; the uplifting of the
head as the drawing-room door began to open; the glad look in the eyes
and the quick intake of the breath as she saw the attitude of the two
men, each to the other.

As he came in Athlyne looked at her; a look that seemed to lay any
ghost of a doubt in her mind. She was glad when he went straight
across the room and began to talk with her mother. She was content to
wait till when, having done his social duties, he would find his way
to her. Mrs. Ogilvie had much to say and detained him, Judy thought,
unduly; but Joy gave no possible sign of impatience. When in due
course he spoke a few words to Judy herself that estimable young lady
managed to find something to say to her sister.

When the guest was at last beside her in her corner of the room Joy
felt that all was right and becoming. No matter how willing a woman
may be to take steps to the accomplishment of her own wishes, it is an
added pleasure to her when she is the objective of man rather than his
pursuer. Even the placid pussy-cat when her thoughts tend to
flirtation runs--slowly--from her mate until she sees that he notices
her going. Then she stops and sings to him--in her own manner of
music--as he approaches.

The two young people did not use many words in their speech; such
seemed inadequate for what they had to say. Suffice it that what they
did say was thoroughly understood.

Athlyne did not prolong his stay, much as he would have enjoyed
staying. He felt that it would be better, in every way, if he did not
enforce his first opportunity. Mrs. Ogilvie very graciously hoped that
he would manage to make them a visit before sailing. Joy said
nothing--in words. He had a little conversation with Colonel Ogilvie
who was standing away from the rest and leaning on the chimney piece.

When he had gone Joy said good-night to them all; she felt that at
present she _could_ not talk the little commonplaces of affectionate
life; and she could not bear to hear “him” discussed. If that acute
reasoner on causes and effects in the female mind, Aunt Judy, had been
able to permeate her heart and brain she would at once have understood
that simple way of accepting a man’s personality--simulacrum. What
need is there to differentiate when there is but one. Names are given
as aids to memory; and at times memory ceases to be an important
matter.

The next evening after dinner “Mr. Hardy” became the subject of
conversation, and Joy was not comfortable. She knew that there must be
divergent views regarding any one, and was content to let them all
have their own opinions. She had hers. Indeed she would not have been
wholly content to hear him praised even up to the perfection which she
allowed him. He was by far too personal a possession of her own to
share even community of feeling regarding him with any one.

In the night that had passed her own feeling had grown, multiplied;
the feelings of the others had changed too, but in a different way.
The glamour which had become for her intensified had for them been
lost in the exactness of perspective. Perhaps it was that Joy’s night
had been different from theirs. To her had come all the evils of
reaction. Now and again with wearing recurrency came the exciting
memories of the day; but always with that kaleidoscopic inconsistency
which is the condition of dreaming. The brains of most people are not
accustomed to self-analysis, else we should perhaps more widely
understand that this very inconsistency is mere reproduction. Whilst
we think we do not think that we are thinking, and memory does not
adjust our thoughts to comparison. But, all the time, our thoughts are
really errant; reflections of the night, which seem to be
exaggerations or caricatures, are but just surveys taken from an
altitude which is not our own. In the day time thought is too often
initiated by carnal or material considerations. Selfishness, and need,
and ambition, and anxiety are bases on which thought is built in
working and waking hours. But in the dark and freedom of the night the
mind borrows the wings of the soul and soars away from the body which
is held down by all its weighty restraints. It is perhaps in such
moments that we realise that passion, however earthly may be its
exciting cause, is in itself an attribute or emanation of the Soul.
Over and over again did Joy live through the mad moments of that ride
towards death. Over and over again did that heroic figure sweep up
beside her out of the great unknown. She began to understand now
whence came her calmness and quickness of apprehension as she realised
his presence--the presence of a man who dominated her--even whose
horse in the easiness of its calm intention outstripped the wildness
of her own maddened steed. Here again the abstract mind was working
truly; the horse had its own proper place in her memories of the
heroic deed. Over and over again did that strong hand and arm seize
her; and over and over again did her body sway to him and yield itself
to the clasp, so that at his command it went to him as though of its
own volition. And then, over and over again, came the remembrance of
the poor mad mare disappearing over the edge; of the sickening crash
from below and the wild scream of agony; of the confused rush and
whirl; of the crowding in of people; of the vista of moving carriages
and crowds down the curve of the road. And then all kept fading away
into a blind half consciousness of the strong arm supporting her and
her wearied head resting on his shoulder. …

This evening Mrs. Ogilvie was very quietly inclined to be tearful. She
too had had a bad night; constant wakings from vague apprehensions,
horrible imaginings of unknown dangers; dread that she could not
localise or specify. Altogether she was upset, something as one is in
the low stage following an attack of hysteria; nervous, weak,
apprehensive, inclined to misunderstand things on the melancholy side.

Colonel Ogilvie was in that state of mind following a high pressure,
which is a masculine reaction. He was very hard to please about
anything. His wife always thought of this nervous and intellectual
condition as “one of Lucius’s humours,” to others she said “the
Colonel is worried about something.” Judy called it: “one of his
tantrums.” This however did not affect his manner, outwardly. At such
times he was perhaps even more precise than usual in his observance of
the little etiquettes and courtesies of social life. It had perhaps
been unfortunate that his household was exclusively female, for want
of opposition rather encouraged the tendency. In his club or amongst
men such irritation or ill feeling as he had found more outward
expression; and the need to keep himself so that standard of personal
hearing which his own self esteem had set, perpetually recalled him to
himself. But at home, this, though it would not have been possible for
a stranger to find fault with any part of his manner or bearing, still
kept the rest of the family in a sort of hushed self-surrender. Even
Judy the daring kept her natural exuberance in control at such times
and was content to rest in unnoticed quiet. Joy knew well the storm
signals and effaced herself as far as possible; she loved her father
too well and respected him too much to do or say anything which might
cause him disquiet or tend to lower him in his own eyes.

Judy on this as on other occasions maintained a strictly neutral
position. But her wits were keener and her eyes more observant even
than usual on that very account. She did not know the cause of her
brother-in-law’s disturbance, but she understood it all the same. Few
things there are which lead so directly to the elucidation of truth as
a clever, unselfish woman on the watch.

Silence rather than speech was the order of the day, and the talking,
such as it was, began with Colonel Ogilvie. Men when they are carrying
out a settled intention or policy can be more silent than women; their
nerves are stronger and their nature more fixed. But in the casual
matters of life they are children in the hands of women. Here were
three women, all of them clever, all of them attached to the man and
all respecting him; but they had only to remain neutral, each in her
individual way, and let him overcome the _vis inertia_ as well as he
could. He could not but be aware that the subject of the guest of last
evening had been tacitly avoided. He had been conscious of such in his
own case, and with the egotism which was so marked a part of his own
character he took it for granted that the avoidance was with the
others due to the same cause as with himself. It was therefore with
something like complacency--if such a thing could be synchronous with
irritability, even if one of the two be in a latent condition--that he
began on the deferred subject:

“I am afraid that our guest last night did not enjoy himself!” There
was silence for a few seconds. Then each of the three listeners,
feeling that some remark must be made by some one, spoke suddenly and
simultaneously:

“Why, Lucius, what do you mean?”

“You surprise me, Colonel!”

“Is that so, Daddy!”

He waited deliberately before saying more; he had been thinking over
the subject and knew what he wanted to say. Then he spoke with an air
of settled conviction:

“Yes, my dear!” He spoke to Joy alone, and thus, to all three,
unconsciously gave away his purpose. “I thought so at the time, and
to-day, whenever I have considered the matter, the conviction has
increased.” Mrs. Ogilvie, seeing on her daughter’s face a certain
hardening of the muscles, took it for granted that it was some form of
chagrin; in a protective spirit she tried to make that matter right:

“My dear Lucius, I really cannot see how you arrive at such a
conclusion. It seemed to me that the young man was in rather an
exalted condition of happiness. I could not help noticing the way he
kept looking at Joy. And indeed no wonder after the gallant way he had
saved her life.” She added the last sentence as a subtle way of
reminding her husband that they were all under obligation to the young
gentleman. Moreover there was in her heart as a mother--and all
mothers are the same in this respect--that feeling of pride in her
daughter which demands that all men shall be attracted by her charms.
No matter how detrimental a man may be, nor how determined she is that
his suit shall not be finally successful, a mother considers it the
_duty_ of the young man to love her daughter and desire her.

Joy somehow felt humiliated. It was not merely that she should be the
centre of such a discussion--for, after all, it was through rescuing
her that he was there at all; but she was hurt and disappointed that
this particular man should be discussed in any way. She had seen no
fault in him; nothing to discuss in his conduct or his bearing or his
words or his person. She herself had admired him immensely. He was
somehow different from all the other men she had ever seen. … Then
pride came to her rescue. Not pride for herself, but for him. In her
heart he was her man, and she had to protect his honour; and she would
do so, if necessary. This idea at once schooled her to restraint, and
steeled her to endure. With an unconscious shrug she remained silent.

But Judy’s keen eyes had been on her, and both her natural sympathy
and the experience of her own heart allowed her to interpret pretty
well. She saw that for Joy’s sake--either now or hereafter--some
opposition to the Colonel’s idea was necessary. She had noticed the
settled look--it had not yet become a frown--which came over his face
when his wife spoke of his looking at Joy. In just such moments and on
subjects as this it is that a father’s and a mother’s ideas join
issue. Whilst the mother expects the singling out of the daughter for
devotion, the father’s first impulse is to resent it. Colonel
Ogilvie’s resentment had all his life been habitually expressed with
force and rapidity; even in a tender matter of this kind the habit
unconsciously worked.

“All the more reason, Sarah, for his being candid about himself. For
my own part I can understand one attitude or the other; but certainly
not both at once!”

Joy began to get seriously alarmed. The mere use of her mother’s
formal name was a danger-signal of rare use. By its light she could
realise that her father had what he considered in his own mind to be a
real cause of complaint. She did not like to speak herself; she feared
that just at present it might complicate matters. So she looked over
appealing at Judy, who understood and spoke:

“What two attitudes? I’m afraid I for one, don’t understand. You _are_
talking in riddles to-night!” She spoke in a gay debonair manner so
like her usual self that her brother-in-law was unsuspicious of any
underlying intent of opposition. This was just the opportunity for
which he was waiting. With a sardonic smile he went on, singling out
Joy as before:

“Your mother, my dear, has told us one of them. Perhaps the young man
did look at you. There’s little wonder in that. Were I a young man and
a stranger I should look at you myself; and I would also have looked
at any other man who dared to look at you too. If this is a man’s
attitude he should be more genial--more explicit--more open--less
constrained to her relatives. That my dear Judy,”--he turned to her as
he spoke “is the other attitude.” Mrs. Ogilvie answered--the
conversation to-night was decidedly oblique:

“Really, Colonel, I can’t agree with you. For my own part I thought
his attitude towards her relatives was all that was courteous and
respectful. Certainly to her mother!” She bridled, and Joy grew more
serious. Her mother calling her husband “Colonel” was another
danger-signal; and she knew that if once her father and mother got to
loggerheads over him--“him” was her way of thinking of Mr. Hardy--it
might keep him away from her. She summoned up her courage and said
with all the affectionate raillery which was usually so effective with
her father:

“Daddy dear do you remember Æsop’s fable about the Boy and the
Frogs?”

“I suppose I ought to, little girl; but I’m afraid I have forgotten.
What was it about?”

“The Boys were throwing stones at the Frogs, and when the Frogs
remonstrated the Boys said they were doing it for fun. So the Frogs
answered: ‘It may be fun to you; but it is death to us!’” Colonel
Ogilvie puckered up his eyebrows:

“I remember, now, my dear; but for the life of me I don’t see its
application here.” Joy said with a preternatural demureness:

“It means Daddy, that you are the Boy and I am the Frog!” Her father’s
gravity became intensified:

“That does not help me much, daughter!”

“Well, you see, Daddy, here are you and mother commenting on how a man
looked at me--and--so forth. But you don’t take into consideration the
sensitiveness of a woman’s heart--let alone her vanity. I think you’ve
forgotten that I am not now ‘merely a child emerging into
womanhood’--don’t you remember on the _Cryptic_--but a staid woman to
whose waning attractions everything relating to a man is sacred. One
who looks on man, her possible rescuer from the terrors of old
maidhood with the desperation of accomplished years.” As she had
spoken unthinkingly the word “rescuer” a hot tide of blood had rushed
to her face, but she went bravely on to the end of her sentence. There
was not one of the three who did not understand the meaning. Her
mother and aunt were concerned at the self-betrayal. Her father’s face
grew fixed, now to sternness. With a faint heart Joy felt that she had
made a terrible mistake, and inwardly condemned herself for its
foolishness. Colonel Ogilvie now went on with grave deliberateness, he
was determined that there should be no error regarding his
disapprobation. All the time he was inwardly fuming against Mr. Hardy
whom he held responsible:

“As I was saying, that fellow’s attitude, as it appeared to me, was
wanting in both openness and that confidence which underlies respect.”
Here Joy quivered. Judy, watching her, noticed it and for a moment was
scared. But the girl at once forced herself into calm, and Judy’s
anxiety quite disappeared. She knew that Joy was now quite master of
herself, and would remain so. The Colonel, accepting the dejected
silence as a request to continue, went on:

“Of course there is no need for me to say that he is a very gallant
fellow and a superb horseman, and that his manners are those of a
polished gentleman. Nor, further still, that I and mine are under a
deep debt of gratitude to him. But there are some things which a man
can do, or what is worse which he can leave undone, that show
distrust.”

“What things, for instance?” It was Judy who asked the question
falteringly; but it was to Joy that the answer was directed:

“Well, my dear, I shall illustrate. When I, wishing to show that we
all took an interest in him and his surroundings, mentioned Airlville
and spoke of clubs and such matters he did not proffer me any
information. Still, thinking that his reserve might be that usually
attributed to the stand-off-ness of the English as often accepted
here--that it was due to habit rather than intent--I asked him where
he lived in London. He wrote an address on one of his cards--which by
the way has no address graven on it--and handed it to me, saying:
‘That is only a lodging. I have not got a house yet.’ Then I asked
what clubs he belonged to; and he simply said ‘Several’ and began to
ask me questions about what sport we usually have in Kentucky. Now my
dear, I am not usually inquisitive; and as this man was my guest I
could not proceed in face of such a--a snub.” He winced at the word.
“But as I was really anxious that we should see more of one who had
rendered us so signal a service, I expressed a hope that when we were
in England in the summer we might have the pleasure of seeing him. I
am bound to say that he reciprocated the wish very eagerly. He asked
me a host of questions as to our plans; and I told him what we had
arranged about the Lake Country and the Border of which we have such
traditions in our family. He certainly has a very winning way with
him, and I quite forgot at the time his want of trust about his
residence and his clubs!”

“Perhaps he may have no home; he may be a poor man,” suggested Aunt
Judy. The Colonel answered her, this time directly:

“He may not be a rich man, but he is certainly not a poor one. You and
I” this to Joy “saw him pay three thousand for that horse. And he is
free with his money too in other ways. That police sergeant who was
with me this morning--and who, my dear, asked me to convey his
gratitude to you; I gave it for you--told me that the gentleman had
given him on the Viaduct a hundred dollars for himself, and then
another hundred for the officer who was run down.”

“How generous!” said Judy. Joy said nothing; but she leaned forward,
gladness in her eyes. There is some chord in a woman’s heart which
sounds to any touch of generosity or even of liberality. It is some
survival of conditions of primitive life, and a permanent female
attribute. Judy, anxious to propitiate her brother-in-law, and to
preserve the absent man’s character, said as though it were the
conclusion of some process of reasoning:

“He must be some important person who is here on private business.”
Ogilvie smiled genially:

“Our dear Judy will find a romance in everything--even in a man’s
distrust!” Judy, somewhat nettled, felt like defending her own
position. This had nothing to do with Joy so she felt she could argue
freely about it:

“It needn’t be a romance, Lucius, only fact!”

“My dear Judy, I don’t see why a man should give so extravagantly
merely because he is on private business. Why, it is the very way to
attract attention.” Judy was made more obstinate by the apparent
appositeness of the remark and by the tolerant tone of the speaker.

“I don’t mean that he gives _because_ he is on private business,
surely you know that; but that he may be an important man who gives
handsomely as a habit. He may be keeping his identity concealed.”

“How do you mean exactly. How keep his identity concealed? He never
told me; and he has been my guest!” Colonel Ogilvie had a puzzled look
on his face.

“Well, for instance by taking another name for the occasion.
Perhaps--” Here she caught sight of the look of positive horror on
Joy’s face and stopped short. Joy had seen in what direction the
conversation was drifting, but was afraid to interfere lest she should
bring on the very catastrophe which she dreaded. She had never
forgotten her father’s expressions regarding an alias; and she had
reason to fear that should his suspicions be in any way directed
towards the new friend whose accidental acquaintanceship already
promised so much, some evil or hindrance must ensue. But her
hypothetical concern was lost in a real one. As Judy spoke, the
Colonel started to his feet, his manner full of suppressed fury. He
was bristling all over, preliminary of his most dangerous mood.

Joy rose to the occasion. It was now or never. It was apparent that
her father had taken that form of offence which is generally expressed
in idiom or slang. Cornishmen call it a “scunner,” Cockneys “the
hump,” Irishmen “an edge,” Americans “shirty.” It is a condition
antecedent to active offence; a habitat of the germ of
misunderstanding; a searchlight for cause of quarrel. Joy felt cold,
into the very marrow of her bones; well she knew that her father would
never forgive any such offence to him as was implied in an assumed
name. His remarks on the subject flamed before her like fiery
handwriting on the walls of her memory. Moreover Judy’s incautious
remark had but echoed her own thought. All day she had been dreaming
of this man who had plunged so gallantly into her life. Naturally
enough to a young woman, she had been weaving romances in various
forms round that very identity which, even to her, had been
unexpressed if not hidden. Naturally her dreams had in them some
element of concealment; romances always have. She had in her secret
heart taken it for granted that this man must be distinguished--how
could he be otherwise; and now her father’s suspicion might result in
some breach which might result in her never seeing him again. … It
was a possible tragedy! To her, grim and real from her knowledge of
her own heart; and none the less a real tragedy or less potent because
its bounds were lost in the vagueness of mist and fear. … She was
pale and inwardly trembling; but, all the same, her light laugh rang
true; she was desperate and fighting for her man, and so was strung up
to nature’s pitch:

“Why, Daddy, if you’re going to kill anyone it will have to be dear
Aunt Judy. She’s the one who has made the alias. The poor man
himself--who by the way is not here to answer for himself and
explain--hasn’t done any conceivable thing wrong that we know of--even
you Daddy know that; except not having a house and not bragging of his
clubs!”

This seemed to strike her father; it touched him on the point of
Justice. The lightness of his daughter’s laugh reassured him.

“True!” he said. “That is quite true. I was too hasty. And he saved my
little girl’s life!” He rose from the table and putting his arm round
her shoulders kissed her. Then they went into the drawing-room.

Joy bore up bravely for the rest of the evening. But when she was in
bed and assured that she was alone, the reaction came. She was as cold
as a stone and trembled all over. Putting her face down into her
pillow she pulled the sheet over her head and wept her very heart out.

“Oh what it might have been if all went well. But what might be if
Daddy took some queer idea … and quarrelled …!”




 CHAPTER VIII.
 “LOOK AT ME!”

When on Tuesday afternoon “Mr. Hardy” visited at the Holland House
he found only the single ladies at home. Colonel Ogilvie had gone out
in the morning to see after several matters of business, both in
connection with Air and relating to the forthcoming visit to Europe.
He had said he would probably not be back till dinner time. Mrs.
Ogilvie had gone out after lunch for a drive and would pay some visits
before returning home. Joy pleaded headache as an excuse for remaining
at home. Indeed her excuse was quite real; no one can pass so
melancholy a part of a night as she had done without suffering the
next morning. As the day wore on, however, the headache insensibly
departed; something else had taken its place. Joy would not admit to
herself what that something was; but that afternoon she took unusual
pains with her toilet. Judy noticed it with her usual acute
observation, understood it with her understanding sympathy; with her
wonted discretion she remained silent. She felt, and rightly, that the
time had not yet come when she could either be serious with Joy or
jest with her on the subject nearest to her heart. One thing she did
which can never be out of place, especially when it is true: she
showed pleasure in her niece’s looks, taking care, however to put her
own reason for it on a non-offensive basis.

“Joy,” she said “that terrible experience of Sunday has not told on
you a bit. You are looking simply lovely.” Ordinarily Joy would have
known it, and would not have shrunk from admitting it to herself, or
possibly even to her aunt; but to-day she was full of self doubting.
Her very flush of happy excitement when her aunt spoke would have
betrayed her secret to a much less sympathetic or experienced person
than Judy.

It is love more than any other cause or emotion or feeling which
creates self-distrust with the young. And sometimes with the old, for
the matter of that.

When she found that Aunt Judy did not “chaff” her or ask her
questions, which she rather feared would happen, Joy beamed. Indeed it
looked to Judy’s loving eyes as if she visibly blossomed. Judy spoke
of her dress, remarking how well the dark full-coloured green silk
became her slender figure; but she was careful not to overdo her
praise, or to suggest any special cause for so elaborate a toilet.

But Judy was of a distinctly practical nature. She took care to send a
message to the hall that if any visitors should come, though both
Colonel and Mrs. Ogilvie were out, Miss Ogilvie and Miss Hayes were at
home.

Athlyne found both ladies busily idle. Joy was reading a novel; which
by the way she put down hurriedly without as Judy noticed, marking the
place. Judy was knitting; that sort of heavy uninteresting knitting
which is manifestly for the poor! She was used to say that such was
the proper sort of occupation for an old maid. She, too, put down the
cause of her occupation, but deliberately; thereby giving time for the
guest to salute her niece without the need of interruption. It did not
matter, then, if Joy’s hand did remain an instant longer in his than
formality demanded, nor if--when released--it was white in patches as
when extra force is applied to delicate flesh. For a few minutes Judy
joined in the conversation with her usual brilliancy. But to-day she
was distinctly restless, sitting down and jumping up again; moving out
of the room quietly and coming back noisily--the proper way as she
said on an after occasion for all old maids to move. Whenever she came
back she would join in the conversation in a sort of butterfly fashion
till she flitted away again.

In one of these trios when Mr. Hardy happened to remark that he would
like to know what the movements of the Ogilvies would be, and what
address they gave for letters when they were away, Joy answered:

“Daddy always has our letters sent to Brown Shipleys in Pall Mall. But
we shall be moving about a good deal I expect. Mother has to take
baths at Ischia again, and one of us will stay with her; but Daddy
wants to go about a bit and see something of England. He is set on
seeing the Border counties this summer.”

“Then how am I to know where you are?” he asked impulsively. With a
bright smile Joy nodded over to Miss Hayes:

“You had better ask Aunt Judy. She might keep you advised. She’s the
letter-writer of the family!”

When in her turn Joy had moved away on some little domestic duty he
turned to Judy and said:

“Won’t you let me know the moves on the board, Miss Hayes. It would be
very kind of you.” He looked so earnest over it that she felt her
heart flutter. She said at once:

“Of course I shall, if you will let me have an address to write to.”
He had evidently thought over this part of the matter, for he took
from his pocketbook a card on which he had written below his printed
name: care Jonathan Goldsworth, Solicitor. 47B Lincoln’s Inn Fields,
London, W. C. “That will always find me. I may be away or travelling;
but my letters are sent on every day.”

Judy thanked him, and seeing that Joy was out of earshot added on her
own account:

“It is only right that you, who did so much for my dear niece--and so
for us all--should know at least where she is.”

“Thank you very, very much!” said Athlyne impulsively. He had all an
Irishman’s instinctive knowledge of woman’s character and felt that
Judy was to be trusted, that she was heart-wholly devoted to her
niece. On her part Judy _knew_ that he could be trusted to the full,
especially where Joy was concerned. And from that moment she began to
take an interest in the love affair; an interest quite personal to
herself and independent of her love for the girl. She felt that she
was a participant in all schemes which were to be; and that, she came
to the conclusion, was about all the real romance that an old maid
could share in. “Thank God there’s that left at any rate!” was her
prayer of gratitude.

Athlyne felt a powerful impulse to make a _confidante_ of her. This
was the first chance he had of disclosing the reality of things, and
he was just about to begin when Joy returned. Once again did that
self-distrust, incidental to his state of mind, cramp him. He fancied
that it might be premature. Not knowing how deeply Joy cared for him
already, he was unwilling to take any chance which might militate
against his ultimate success. There was also another hampering feeling
coincident with the self-distrust: he thought it might be possible
that a confidence made to Judy might be embarrassing to her with her
own folk. Already his devotion was deep enough and pure enough to
prevent his doing intentionally anything which might cause her pain.
Could Aunt Judy have looked into his heart, as she could and would
have done had he been a woman, she would have been satisfied of the
genuineness of his affection; and so she would have had no doubts at
all as to the end of Joy’s love affair.

Joy’s return, however, brought somehow a sense of restraint. She had
herself originated or initiated a mechanism of correspondence and she
feared that Mr. Hardy might notice that she had done so. In her
present state of feeling towards the man, the very idea of such a
thing was fraught with humiliation. It is extraordinary how much
people take to heart the belief on the part of others of that they
have intended. Truth, truly, is a bright weapon; even the flash of it
has its own terrors!

Judy did not comprehend exactly what the trouble was. She could see
that there was restraint on both sides, and was wondering whether it
had been possible that he had been speaking too impulsively--“going
too quick” was the way she put it to herself--and that Joy had
resented or feared it. Not the fact but the rapidity. Well Judy knew
that in her youth a woman most holds back when the wildest desire of
her heart is to rush forward; that the instinct of woman being to draw
man on, she will spend the last ounce of her strength in pushing him
back. Judy had once said:

“A woman wants a man to be master, and specially to be her master. She
wants to feel that when it comes to a struggle she hasn’t got a chance
with him, either to fight or to run away. That’s why we like to make a
man follow when in truth we are dying to run after him--and to catch
him up!” Some of her circle to whom the heterodox saying had been
repeated professed to be very indignant as well as horrified. This was
chiefly noticeable in such of the most elderly of the good ladies as
had a lurid past or a large family, or both.

If, however, Judy had any doubts as to the cause she had none whatever
of the fact. There was no mistaking the droop of Joy’s eyes, or the
sudden lifting and quick dropping of the lids which makes the densest
man’s heart flutter; no mistaking his eager look; the glowing eyes
ranging over face and form when the windows of her soul were closed,
and entranced in their light when they were open. Judy herself knew
the power of those gray, deep eyes. Even when her niece had been a
baby there seemed something hypnotic about them. They could disarm
anger, or change the iron of theory into the water of fact. Often and
often after some such episode when she had thought the matter over she
had said to herself:

“Lord! if she’s like that as a baby with me, what will she be with a
man when she’s a woman!” Judy who was a self-observer knew
instinctively that in Joy was an inherent influence over men. There
was some very subtle, delicate force which seemed to emanate from her;
some force at once compelling and tranquillizing, for the explanation
of which mere will-power was insufficient. The power was now in active
exercise; but it was turned inwards. Joy was in love! Judy knew it as
well as if she had herself acknowledged it; indeed better, for the
acknowledgment of such a secret, except to the man himself, is given
with reserve. And so she made up her mind to further the affair; but
to prevent Joy betraying herself unduly during such furtherance. By
“unduly” Judy really meant “unwisely” as to ultimate and most complete
efficacy.

She had an idea that Joy herself would approve, at present, of such
discretion. It seemed a direct confirmation of such idea when
presently the girl said to her in a faint whisper:

“Don’t go away again Aunt Judy!”

When, however, in the course of conversation as the three sat chatting
together happily, Mr. Hardy mentioned that his ship sailed in the
early morning and she saw the colour leave the girl’s cheeks for a
moment, just as a white squall sweeps a sunlit sea, Judy’s heart
softened. She understood that retreating wave of colour. Nature has
its own analogies to its own anomalies; there is a white blackbird,
why not a white blush! So when the time drew near for the departure of
the visitor Judy slipped away for a minute. When she had gone the two
sat still. Athlyne’s eyes were on Joy, eager, burning. Her eyes were
down, the black lashes curling against her cheeks. In a voice rather
husky he said in a low tone:

“Won’t you think of me sometimes till we meet again?” Her answer was
given in what she wished to be a matter-of-fact tone, but the slight
quaver in it told another story:

“Of course I shall! How can I help it? You saved my life!” There was
an entrancing demureness in the downcast eyes. But it was not enough
for the man. He wanted to see the eyes, to gaze in them, to lose
himself in them once again. There is for each individual nature some
distinctive way of expressing itself. Sometimes it is the mouth which
tells the story; sometimes it is by simple existence such as the lines
of the nose or forehead, by the shape and movement of the hands;
sometimes by a characteristic habit. Joy’s nature spoke through the
eyes; perhaps it is, that intention is best given by the eyes. Anyhow
the lover wanted to see them.

In a low voice--not a whisper--that thrilled with intensity he said:

“Joy, look at me!” He spoke her name, though it was for the first
time, quite unconsciously. As she heard it Joy’s heart beat so that
she feared he would notice it, and all the self-protective instincts
of womanhood rose at the thought. For an instant her face glowed; then
it grew pale again. She did not hesitate, however. She raised her eyes
and looked him full in the face. Her cheeks were flaming now, but she
did not heed it. In the face of nature what, after all, is convention.
As Athlyne lost himself in those wonderful eyes he had a wild almost
over-mastering desire to take her in his arms and kiss her straight on
the beautiful mouth. He was bending towards her for the purpose, she
was swaying towards him, he believed; but for long afterwards he could
not be sure of the matter.

But suddenly he saw a change in the girl’s face, a look of something
like terror which seemed in an instant to turn her to stone. It was
but a momentary change, however. The spasm passed, and, just as though
it was to his eyes as if he had waked from a dream, she was her
easeful self again. At the same moment the outer door of the _piece_
opened and Mrs. Ogilvie’s voice was heard as she entered:

“Judy, I am so glad! I am told he has not gone yet. I should have been
so sorry if I had not seen him!” When she entered the room, three
seconds later, she found the two young people talking quietly
according to the demure common-place of convention.

Mrs. Ogilvie was very hearty in her manner; a little more hearty than
usual, for she had a sort of feeling as if something extra in the way
of civility was due to him after the way her husband had spoken of
him. This was illustrative of two things. First the woman’s
unconscious acceptance of an unfavourable criticism of an absent
person, as if it had been made to and not merely of him; second the
way the sternness of a man’s judgment is viewed by the females of his
family. She insisted that Mr. Hardy should stay for tea and asked Joy
to ring and order it.

Joy had been at once relieved and disappointed by the sudden entry of
her mother. The maidenhood in her was glad of the postponement of the
necessity for her surrender; the womanhood in her was disappointed by
it. She was both maid and woman; let the female reader say, and the
male reader guess, which feeling most predominated. She was glad that
_he_ was staying a little longer; for so she might at least feast her
eyes on him again; but it was at best a chastened gladness, for well
she knew that that thrilling moment would not come again--during that
interview. And he was going away next morning!

Athlyne, too, was ill at ease. He, too, knew there would be no more
opportunity now to follow up his declaration. The chagrin of his
disappointment almost made him cross, such being the nature of man.
Here, however, both his breeding and the kindliness of his nature
stood to him; the shadow quickly passed. Later on in the evening, when
he was thinking the matter over, he came to the conclusion that the
interposition, though he did not attribute it to any divine origin,
was after all perhaps best. It could not, or might not, suit him to
declare himself so quickly. He felt that under the circumstances of
his false name it would be necessary, or at any rate wise, to take
Colonel Ogilvie into his confidence before declaring himself to his
daughter.

It is thus that we poor mortals deceive ourselves. He had been just
about to declare himself in the most passionate and overt way a man
can; by taking the girl in his arms and kissing her, without even a
passing thought of her father. But now, from some other cause, quite
outside the girl and not even within her knowledge, he found his duty.
One might with this knowledge easily differentiate the values of
“necessary” and “wise” in his mind regarding his confession to her
father.

Joy found a very distinct, though shy, pleasure in handing him tea and
cake. Judy as usual presided at the tea-table. She did not interfere
unduly with her niece’s ministrations, but she took care that she had
plenty of opportunities. “Joy dear won’t you see if Mr. Hardy will
take more tea?”--“has Mr. Hardy enough sugar?” and so forth. She had
noticed those sudden liftings of the girl’s eyes, and knew what they
meant to a woman--and to a man. Athlyne did not as a rule make tea a
“square” meal, but this time he got in that direction. He refused
nothing she offered. He would have accepted death at her hands now, if
it would have pleased her; and it was only the girl’s discretion which
saved the situation.

In due time he made his adieux and took his leave. With Joy there was
no more than a handshake. It was perhaps part of a second longer than
customary, but the force with which the squeeze was given lingered
long in her memory. Perhaps it was the pain inflicted in the operation
which made her often during the evening, when she was alone, caress
the possibly wounded hand! That night she went to sleep with her right
hand pressed to her heart.

Judy had a wild impulse to tell Joy to go to the door with the
departing guest, but in the presence of her mother she did not dare to
suggest it. Had she been alone she would probably have done so.

Athlyne walked away with his mind in a whirl. In his heart was ever
surging up through all other thoughts that one sublime recognition
which comes to every man at least once in his life: that which Sir
Geraint voiced:

“Here, by God’s rood is the one maid for me!” To this all other
thoughts gave way. It obsessed him. When he came to Forty Second
Street he did not turn towards the hotel but kept straight on up Fifth
Avenue till he reached Central Park. He felt the need of movement. He
wanted to be alone in the open. At Central Park his steps took him
seemingly of their own accord towards the Riverside Drive. When he
came to a place amongst trees seeming to hang over the river he sat on
a seat and gave way to his thoughts. There was no one near him. Below
him was the quiet river with its passing life; beyond, the Jersey
shore so distant that details of life were not apparent. He took off
his hat, more in reverence than for ease, as he thought of the
beautiful girl who had so strangely come into life. Over and over
again he said to himself in endless repetition:

“Joy! Joy! Joy! Joy!” He sat till the light began to fail and for long
after the sudden darkness of the American night had swooped down. Then
he went home.

In the hotel he found a visitor waiting for him. Mr. Breckenridge had
come to say good-bye. He did so with so much heartiness that Athlyne
could not bear to be aught but hearty himself. Though he longed to be
alone he insisted on the young fellow coming up to his own rooms.

The boy was not quite at ease so Athlyne said to him:

“There is something on your mind. What is it?”

“Well, look here, sir,” he answered gravely. “You have treated me like
a comrade, and I want to treat you like one!”

“Go on, old chap. I’m listening.” Not without some nervousness the
other proceeded:

“I saw in the _Journal_ last evening that you had dined on Sunday
evening in the Holland with Colonel Ogilvie.”

“Those damned reporters!” interrupted Athlyne, but at once told him
with a wave of his hand to proceed:

“That hung in my mind from something you said to me the other evening.
That confidence which I shall always value.” Athlyne nodded. He went
on:

“I know something of that family. I’m from Kentucky myself; and I was
there for a while--that time of the nigger disturbance you know--and I
was quartered not far from Airlville. I have met Colonel Ogilvie; but
it was on duty and amongst a good many others so he would not remember
me. I never met any of his family; but I need not tell you that I fell
in love with Miss Ogilvie. No fellow could help that; one glimpse of
her is enough---- However---- I heard a lot down there about the old
man, and as I was keen about the girl I took it all in and remembered
it. I want to tell you this, because he is a very peculiar man. He is
a splendid old chap. As brave as a lion, and as masterful as Teddy
Roosevelt himself. But all the same he has his ideas which are hardly
up to date. He is as stern as Fate in matters of--of--well, social
matters. They told me a story of him which when I recalled it has
troubled me since I saw you. It was about a man whose identity he
mistook and who for a jest allowed the error to go, and kept it up. He
was a Northern of course, for a Southern would have understood, and
our boys are sometimes very keen on a joke. But it was no joke when
the old man tumbled to it. He called it an unforgivable outrage and
insisted on fighting over it. I tell you it nearly cost the joker his
life. He was drilled right through, and only escaped death by a
miracle. I tell you all this, sir, because of your confidence in me.
If I might make a suggestion--you won’t think it beastly presumptuous
of me will you?” Athlyne held out his hand; the other after shaking
it, went on: “I would venture to suggest that--of course if you have
not done so already--you should take him into your confidence before
leaving here. It might be awkward if the old man were to find out for
himself. He would think it a want of trust, and he might never forgive
it. I am sure you would like to meet him and his again--you know you
can’t save the life of a girl like that every day----” He stopped
there, confused and blushing.

Athlyne was touched by the young man’s kindly frankness and sincerity.
He thanked him heartily but in a regretful way added:

“Unfortunately I didn’t tell him. It was all so quick, and there was
no opportunity when we did meet; and now I may not have the chance for
some time. It would not do to write; I must see him and explain. And I
go away early to-morrow. But be sure of this: the very first chance I
get I shall tell him. I do wish for the friendship of him and his; and
I should be main sorry if any foolishness hindered it. I shall have to
do it carefully, I can see from what you tell me that he may construe
my accepting his hospitality in my assumed name as an offence.” He
went to the door with his friend, but before parting he said:

“By the way I should like you to do something for me if you don’t
mind. I have asked the Horse Exchange people to get me another mount
of the same strain as my black, a mare this time. I have given them
full instructions, and if you will, I shall tell them that they must
have your approval. I want some one who knows a good horse; and as I
have given them carte blanche as to price it is right I should have
some one to refer to. They are to send it to England for me.”

When Breckenridge was gone he set about his preparations for his early
start. Strange to say he never thought of dinner at all that day; the
omission may have been due to his hearty tea! As he worked he thought
gravely over what his young friend had told him. He could see good
cause for concern. Colonel Ogilvie’s attitude towards
misrepresentation only echoed his own feeling. He came to the
conclusion that there lay before him much thought; and possibly much
action.

But all the same this branch of the subject did not monopolise his
thoughts that night. As he lay awake he kept repeating to himself
again, and again, and again:

“Joy! Joy! Joy! Joy!” He fell asleep with the words on his lips. The
thought continued in his heart.




 CHAPTER IX.
 THE CAR OF DESTINY

Athlyne did not feel safe till the French vessel was dipping her
nose into the open Atlantic seas, and the Long Island Hills were a
faint blue line on the western horizon. The last dozen hours of his
stay in New York had been as though spent in prison. He knew well now
that he really loved Joy; that this was no passing fancy, no mere
desire of possession of a pretty woman. All phases of the passion of
love, from the solely physical to the purely spiritual, have their own
forces commanding different sets of nerves. Any one of these many
phases may be all-compelling--for a time. But it is rather the blind
dogged reckless pursuit of an immediate purpose than the total
abandonment to a settled conviction. All the passions--or rather the
phases of one passion--are separate and co-ordinate. Inasmuch as they
are centred in one physical identity they are correlated. Nature has
its own mysteries; and the inter-relations of various functions of a
human being form not the least of them. As there are broad divisions
of them--Christians accept three, the ancient Egyptians held to
eight--so must we accept their uses and consequences. “Body and soul,”
so runs the saying of the illiterate, not seldom used in objurgation.
“Body, mind and soul” says the quasi-thinker who believes that he has
grasped the truth of the great parcelling-out of qualities. “Heart,
soul and flesh” says the lover who knows that he understands. The
lover alone it is who knows as distinguished from believing. For his
world is complete; in it there is no striving after knowledge, no vain
desire of many things, no self-seeking. For the true lover’s one idea
is to give. In such a world there can be no doubting, no fearing, no
hoping. Before its creation Pandora’s box has been emptied to the
last. It may be that the lover’s world is only a phantasm, a
condition. It may be that it is a reality which can only be grasped by
those who have been gifted with special powers. It may be that it is
an orb as real as our own world, whirling in space in darkness, and
can only be seen by those who have a new sense of vision. Surely it is
not too much to believe, following the great analogies, that the soul
as well as the body has eyes, and that all eyes of all sorts and
degrees have vision of one kind or another; that there may be even a
power of choice. We know that in the great manifestation which we call
Light are various rays, each with its own distinctive powers and
limitations. When these are all classified and understood, then
science may take breathing time for its next great effort at
investigation. Why, then, may not certain visual organs be adapted to
specific purposes! We know through our sensoria that there is response
in various ways to seekings of our own; whatever be the means of
communication; whatever it be--electrical or magnetic, or through some
other of the occult root forces, the message is conveyed. Why may it
not be, again following the great analogies, that two forces of
varying kind coming together are necessary for creation of any kind.
We know it of lightning, we know it of protoplasm, and of whatever
lies between them of which we know anything. We find or have ground
for believing that the same conditions hold in all the worlds which
germinate and increase and multiply. May it then not be that in
love--“creation’s final law”--the meeting of the two forces of sex may
create a new light; a light strange to either sex alone; a light in
which that other world, spinning in the darkness through ether, swims
into view in that new-created light.

In physical life when flesh touches flesh the whole body responds,
provided that the two are opposite yet sympathetic. When ideas are
exchanged, mind come forth to mind till each understands with a common
force. When soul meets soul some finer means of expression comes into
play. Something so fine and of condition so rare that other senses can
neither realise nor conceive.

But in the lover all the voices speak, and speak simultaneously; the
soul and the mind and the body all call, each to its new-found mate.
What we call “heart” gives the note for that wonderful song of love;
that song of songs whose music is as necessary in a living world as
light or air, and which is more potent in the end than the forces of
winds or seas.

To Athlyne this new world had dawned. In the light which made it
visible to him other things looked small; some of them base. And this,
though the consciousness of love was still wanting; it had only spoken
instinctively. The completeness only comes with that assurance of
reciprocity which need not be spoken in words. Athlyne had been very
close to it. The yearning of his own nature had spoken in that call
out of the depths of his heart: “Joy look at me!” And if there had
been time for the girl’s new-wakened love to surge up through the deep
waters of her virgin timidity his happiness might have been by now
complete. As yet he only believed that there might yet be happiness
for him; he did not know! Had he seen in Joy’s beautiful eyes the
answering look which he hoped for, he would have been justified in a
change of his plans. He would then have spoken to her father at the
earliest possible opportunity, have told him the entire story of his
visit to America under an assumed name, and trusted to his good
feeling to understand and absolve him. As it was he had to accept
existing circumstances; and so he prepared himself for the future.
First he would get rid of his alias; then he would try to see Joy
again and form some idea of his fate. After that he would make his
confession to Colonel Ogilvie; and if the latter still remained
friendly he would press his suit.

If some impartial reasoner, like Judy for instance, had been summing
up the matter for him the same would have said: “What are you
troubling yourself about. You are as good as he is, you are a suitable
match for the girl in every way. You have a title, a large estate, a
fine social position personally. You have a more than good record as a
soldier. You are young, handsome, strong, popular. You saved the
girl’s life at the risk of your own. Then why, in the name of common
sense, are you worrying? The old man is not an ass; he will understand
at once that you had a good reason for assuming another name. He will
see that the circumstances of your meeting were such that you had no
time to undeceive him. He owes you already the deepest debt of
gratitude that a father can owe. The girl owes you also her life. What
in the world better chance do you want? You love the girl yourself
…”

Aye! there it was. He loved the girl! That hampered him.

During the whole time of the voyage he kept to himself. He made no new
friends, not even acquaintances; he had begun to feel that so long as
he remained under the shadow of that accursed alias each momentarily
pleasant episode of his life was only the beginning of a new series of
social embarrassments. When the ship arrived at Havre he got off and
went at once to London. There he stayed for a few days in the lodgings
which he had taken in the name of Hardy. He set himself gravely to
work to wipe out from his belongings every trace of the false name. It
was carefully cut or scraped from the new luggage, obliterated from
the new linen and underclothes by the simple process of scissors. The
cards and stationery were burned. It was with a sigh of relief that,
having discharged all his obligations, he drove to his chambers in the
Albany and resumed his own name and his old life. He was, however,
somewhat restless. He tried to satisfy himself with long rides, but
even the speed of the Kentucky horse who got more than his share of
work did not satisfy him. There was some new uneasiness in his life;
an overwhelming want which nothing of the old routine, no matter how
pleasant it might be, could fill.


When “Mr. Hardy” had said good bye to her, Joy’s new life began. New
life indeed, for Love is a new birth, a re-creation. Whenever she
thought of herself she seemed to be leading a double life. All the
routine, the cares and the duties of the old life remained unchanged;
but superimposed on it was quite a new existence, one of
self-surrender, of infinite yearning, of infinite hope, of endless
doubting as to whether she was worthy of all that which she shyly
believed really existed. She was all sweetness to those around her, to
whom she seemed happy--but with a tinge of sadness. Both her father
and mother believed that she was feeling the reaction from the shock
of the Riverside adventure. Her mother possibly had at first an idea
that she had given some thought to the handsome young man who had
saved her; but when she herself reviewed in her mind how quietly, not
to say unconcernedly, the young man had taken the whole episode she
was content to let it take a minor place in both her concern and her
recollection.

In due course the Ogilvie family set out on their European journey,
and in due course without any occurrence of note they arrived at their
destination.


Hotel Bellevue,
Casamicciŏla, Ischia.

Dear Mr. Hardy:

As I promised to write to you I now try to keep my word. I dare say
you will think that an old maid is glad to get a chance of writing to
a man! Perhaps she is! But I may say a word in your ear: the habit of
personal reticence begins younger and lingers longer than you would
think. However this is not the time or place--or weather for
philosophising. The scenery is far too lovely to think of anything
unpleasant. We got here all right after a voyage which was nice
enough, though rather dull, and with no opportunities of making new
friends. We can’t have runaway horses on shipboard! My sister will
remain here for some weeks and I shall stay with her as it wouldn’t do
to leave her all alone. It brought the whole caboodle of us hurrying
over from America through a blizzard the last time! No, thank you! And
Colonel Ogilvie doesn’t care to travel by himself. He is set on going
up to Westmoreland which he says is the original Country of his branch
of the Ogilvies. He is complaining of getting no riding here; and yet
he says that when he gets to London he will hire a motor. Men are
queer things, aren’t they? The rest of us are quite well and looking
forward to our English visit where we may meet some friends. How are
you? I suppose spending your time as usual galloping about like a
knight-errant on a big black horse rescuing distressed ladies. And
writing letters to a pack of women not _all_ old maids! I suppose you
will spare a moment to write to one in answer to this, just to say
where you are and where you will be in the next few weeks. My
brother’s section of our party leaves here next week. As I am an old
maid I am shy of telling my sister, and most of the rest of us, that I
am writing to a gentleman; but if they knew it they too would send
their love. For my own part I must confine myself to kind remembrance.

                                          Believe me,
                                          Yours faithfully,
                                          Judith Hayes.

P. S.--By the way, I forgot to say that the first contingent will
after a few days in London go on to Cumberland or Westmoreland--I know
it is the “Lake” country!


Athlyne read the letter eagerly; but when he had finished he dropped
it impatiently. There was not a thing in it that he wanted to
know--not once the name he wanted to see. He sat for a while thinking;
then he took it up again saying to himself:

“She’s no fool; it must have taken her some pains to say so little.”
As he read it the second time, more carefully this time and not merely
looking for what he wished to find, the letter told its own story, and
in its own way. Then he smiled heartily as he sat thinking it over and
commenting to himself:

“Not a word about her; not even her name! And yet she must know that
it would be of _some_ interest to me to hear of her. I wonder if it
would do to run over to Ischia. There seems to be a party of them …”
He read over the letter again with a puzzled look, which all at once
changed to a smile. “Good old Judy! So that’s it is it! That’s not the
first letter Miss Judy has written with a double meaning in it. She
hasn’t those fine eyes and that quick wit for nothing. Why it’s as
clever and as secret as that sent to Basing at Pretoria.” For a good
while he pondered over it, making notes on the back of the envelope.
Then he read these over:

“We are at Ischia.

“I am writing because I promised.

“The habit of personal reticence (that means not saying a thing for
yourself) is for both young and old.

“Our voyage was dull, no adventure, no meeting any one like you.

“Mrs. Ogilvie and Judy remain at Ischia some weeks.

“Colonel Ogilvie doesn’t like going alone and goes to the Lake County
(who is to be with him but Joy?)

“He wants to go motoring (seems more in this--think it over).

_The rest of us_--(that can only mean Joy) are looking forward to
meeting friends in England--(that proves she is going with her
father).

“Let me know where you will be during the coming weeks.

“My brother’s section of our party--(He and Joy)--leave here next
week.

“I haven’t told Mrs. Ogilvie _or most of the rest of us_ (Besides Mrs.
O. there are only two so that _most_ of them must mean the
bigger--that is Colonel Ogilvie--she has not told that one of the
two--then she _has_ told the other. And the other is Joy!)

“If any of those kept in ignorance knew they _too_ would send their
love!

“‘_Too!_’ Then one does. Judy sends her own ‘kind remembrance.’ The
only other one, Joy, sends her love--to me.

“Joy sends her love to me!”

He sat for a moment in an ecstasy, holding the letter loosely in his
hand. Then he raised it to his lips and kissed it. Then he kissed it a
second time, a lighter kiss, murmuring:

“That’s for Aunt Judy!” He proceeded with his comment:

“The postscript: ‘After a few days in London--will go on to Cumberland
or Westmoreland.’ No address in either place, what does that mean? She
has been so clever over the rest that she can’t be dull in this. She
_must_ know the London address … she thinks it best not to tell it
to me--why?”

That puzzled him. He could not make out any reason from her point of
view. He was willing to accept the fact and obey directions, but Judy
had been so subtle in the other matter that he felt she must have some
shrewd design in this. But the simple fact was that in this matter she
had no design whatever. She intended to write to him again on hearing
from him and to give him all details.

But for his own part Athlyne had several reasons for not seeing
Colonel Ogilvie in London. Knowing that the father might make some
quarrel out of his coming to his home in a false name he wanted to
make sure of the daughter’s affection before explaining it to him.
Besides there was the matter of continuing the fraud--even to Judy.
Until things had been explained, meeting and any form of familiarity
or even of hospitality on either side was dangerous. He could neither
declare himself nor continue as they knew him. He was known in London
to too many people to avoid possible _contretemps_, even if he decided
to continue the alias with them and take chance, until he could seize
a favourable opportunity. And as he could not introduce the old
gentleman to his friends and his clubs it would be wiser not to see
him at all. When all was said and done the pain of patient waiting
might be the least of many ills.

All the morning and afternoon he thought over the letter which he was
to write to Judy. He despaired of writing anything which could mean so
much; and beyond that again he felt that he could say nothing which
would be so important to its recipient as the message of Judy’s letter
had been to him. How could he hope for such a thing! The letter, which
just before the time of collection he posted with much trepidation,
ran:


“My Dear Miss Hayes:

“Thank you very much for your most kind letter and for all that you
have said and left unsaid. I too had a dull journey from New York and
found London duller still. As a town it seems to have fallen off; but
it will brighten up again I am sure before long! I am glad you are all
well. I suppose your party will re-unite after Mrs. Ogilvie’s cure has
been completed. It is strange how we are all taking to motor cars. I
am myself getting one, and I hope in the early summer to have some
lovely drives. I am looking out for a companion. But it is a difficult
thing to get exactly the one you want, and without such it is lonely
work. Even going the utmost pace possible could not keep one’s mind
away from the want. When I went to America that time I was feeling
lonely and dull; and I have felt lonelier and duller ever since. But
when I get my motor I hope all that will shortly cease. I hope that
when you arrive--if you and Mrs. Ogilvie do come over--that you will
honour my car by riding in it. I shall hope to have some one with me
whom you must like very much--you seem to like nice people and nice
people seem to be fond of you. I greatly fear it will not be possible
for me to see Colonel Ogilvie in London, for I have to be away very
shortly on some business, and I probably shall not be back in time;
but I am going up North in a few weeks--in my new car if it is
ready--and I shall hope to see my friends. Perhaps Colonel Ogilvie and
some of his friends will come for a drive with me. Won’t you let me
know where he will be staying after he leaves London. Please give, if
occasion serves, my warm remembrance to all. I have not forgotten that
delightful conversation we had before tea the day I called. Tell Miss
Joy that I wish we could renew and continue it. Miss Ogilvie must be a
very happy girl to have, in addition to such nice parents who love her
so much, an aunt like you so much her own age, so sympathetic, so
understanding. I cannot tell you how much I am obliged to you for
writing. I look eagerly for another letter.

                                              “Believe me,
                                              Yours very sincerely.”


There he hesitated. He had meant never to write again the name Richard
Hardy. Here the letter seemed to demand it. He had already thought the
matter over in all ways and from all points of view and had, he
thought, made up his mind to go through with the fraud as long as it
was absolutely necessary. There was no other way. But now when he had
to write out the lie--as it appeared to him to be--his very soul
revolted at it. It seemed somehow to dishonour Joy. Since he had
looked into the depth of her eyes, scruples had come to him which had
not ever before troubled him. It was unworthy of her, and of himself,
to continue a lie. And so with him began again the endless circle of
reasoning on a basis of what was false.

A lie, little or big, seems gifted with immortality. At its creation
it seems to receive that vitality which belongs to noxious things. The
germs which preserve disease survive the quick lime of the plague-pit
and continue after the seething mass of corruption has settled into
earthly dust; and when the very bones have been resolved into their
elements the waiting germs come forth on disturbance of the soil
strong and baneful as ever.

Sometimes Athlyne grumbled to himself of the hardness of his lot. It
was too bad that from such a little thing as taking another name, and
merely for the purpose of a self-protective investigation of a lie, he
should find himself involved in such a net-work of deceit. Other
people did things a hundred times worse every day of their lives. He
had often done so himself; but nothing ever came of it. But now, when
his whole future might depend upon it, he was face to face with an
actual danger. If Colonel Ogilvie quarrelled with him about it that
would mean the end of all. Joy would never quarrel with her father; of
that he felt as surely as that he loved her. All unknown to himself
Athlyne had an instinctive knowledge of character. Any one who had
ever seen him exercise the faculty would have been astonished by the
rapidity of its working. The instant he had seen Joy he had recognised
her qualities. He had understood young Breckenridge at a glance;
otherwise he was too shrewd a man to trust him as he had done. It is
not often that a man will entrust the first comer in a crowd with a
valuable horse. To this man, too, an utter stranger, he had entrusted
his secret, the only person who now knew it on the entire American
continent. So also with Colonel Ogilvie. He was assured in his inner
consciousness that that old gentleman would be hard to convince of the
necessity for disguise. There was something about his fine stern-cut
features--so exquisitely modified in his daughter--and in his haughty
bearing which was obnoxious to any form of deceit.

One of these grumbling fits came on him now, and so engrossed him that
he quite forgot to sign the letter. It was in the post box when he
recollected the omission. He rejoiced when he did so that he had not
written the lie. It was queer how sensitive his conscious was
becoming!

One immediate effect of the awakened conscience was that he went about
a motor car that very afternoon. He had said to Miss Judy that he was
getting one, and his words had to be made good. Moreover he had, in
addition to the train of reasons induced by Miss Judy’s mention of
Colonel Ogilvie’s getting a car, a sort of intuition that it would be
of service to him. Of service to him, meant of course, in his present
state of mind with regard to Joy--of service in furthering his love
affair. He had wished for a horse and got one, and it had brought him
to Joy. Now he wanted a motor … The chain of reasoning seemed so
delightfully simple that it would be foolish to dispute it.
Sub-conscious intuition supplied all lacunæ.

The logic of fact seemed to support that of theory. He looked in at
his club to find the name of a motor agency. There in the hall he met
an old diplomatic friend, who after greeting him said:

“This is good-bye as well.”

“How so?” he asked.

“I am off for Persia. Ballentyre got a stroke just as he was starting
and they sent for me in a hurry and offered me the post. It is too
good to refuse, so I am booked for another three years. I was
promising myself a long rest, or a spell in a civilised place anyhow.
It is too bad, just when I was expecting home my new
Delaunay-Belleville car which has been nearly a year in hand.”

“Do you take the car with you?” asked Athlyne feeling a queer kind of
beating of his heart.

“No. It would be useless there; at all events until I see what the
country and the roads are like. I was just off to the agents to tell
them to sell it for me.”

“Strange we should meet. I came here to look up the address of an
agent. I want to buy a car.”

“Look here, Athlyne; why not take over this? I shall have to sell it
at a sacrifice, and why shouldn’t you have the advantage. I’ll let you
have it cheap; I would rather clear it all up before I go.”

“All right, old chap. I’ll take it. What’s the figure?”

“I agreed to pay £1,000. You may have it at what you think fair!”

“All right. Can we settle it now?”

“By all means.” Athlyne took out his cheque-book and wrote a cheque
which he handed to the other.

“I say,” said Chetwynd. “You have made this for the full sum.”

“Quite so! What else could I offer. Why man, do you think I would beat
you down because you are in a hurry. If there is any huckstering it is
I who should pay. I get my car at once, the very car I wanted. I
should have to wait another year.”

Three days after, the car arrived. Athlyne had spent the time in
getting lessons at a garage and learning something of the mechanism.
He was already a fair mechanic and a fine driver of horses; so that
before another week was out he had learned to know his car. He got a
good chauffeur so that he would always have help in case of need; and
before the next letter arrived from Miss Judy he was able to fly about
all over the country. The new car was a beauty. It was 100-110 h. p.
and could do sixty miles an hour easily.

The next letter which he received from Miss Hayes was short and
devoid, so far as he could discern after much study, of any cryptic
meaning whatever. She thus made allusion to the fact that he had not
signed his letter:

“By the way I notice that you forgot to sign your letter. I suppose
you were thinking at the time of other things.” The later sentence was
underlined. The information in the letter was that Colonel Ogilvie and
“his daughter” expected to be in London on the Saturday following her
letter and would stay at Brown’s Hotel, Albemarle Street, “where I
have no doubt they will be happy to see you if you should chance to be
in London at the time. I think Lucius intends to write you.”

The latter sentence was literally gall to him. He knew that he must
not be in London during their stay there. To be away was the only
decent way of avoiding meeting them. He must not meet Colonel Ogilvie
until he had made certain of Joy’s feeling towards him, for he could
not make his identity known till he had that certainty. He could then
explain his position … The rest of the possibilities remained
unspoken; but they were definite in his own mind.

As he had to go away he thought it would be well to study up the
various branches of the Ogilvy as well as of the Ogilvie family. He
would then make a tour on his own account to the various places where
were their ancient seats. As Colonel Ogilvie was interested in the
matter some knowledge on his part might lead … somewhere.




 CHAPTER X.
 A LETTER

Before he set out for London, Colonel Ogilvie wrote a letter to “Mr.
Hardy” which he sent to the address given on the card handed to him at
New York. He had thought over the matter of writing with the
seriousness which he always gave to social matters. Indeed he was
careful to be even more punctilious than usual with this young man;
firstly because he had got the idea that his overtures had not been
cordially received and he wished to be just, secondly because he felt
he must not forget the great service rendered to his daughter and
himself. In his letter he apprised Mr. Hardy that with his daughter he
was coming to London for a week or more, that they would be staying at
Brown’s Hotel, Albemarle Street, and that they would be very pleased
to see him there if he would honour them with a visit, and that
perhaps he would make it convenient to dine with them any evening
which he himself might select. He also told him that Mrs. Ogilvie and
her sister were to remain some weeks longer in Italy, and that they
would join him in the North of England, whence they would go all
together to some bracing part of Scotland, to be decided later on when
the time came for the after-cure. Of course, as he did not know that
Athlyne was already in correspondence with Miss Judy, and was
particular to give details of his future movements. Before posting it
he showed the letter to Joy so that he might have her opinion as to
whether all was correct. Joy was secretly fluttered, but she preserved
admirably her self-control and came well through the ordeal, leaving
no suspicion in the mind of her father as to the real state of things.
She was now very deeply in love; the days that had passed had each and
all fed the flame of her incipient passion. Time and the brain working
together have a period of growth of their own which the
physiopsychists have called “unconscious cerebration,” a sort of
intellectual process whereby crude thoughts are throughout the
darkness of suspended effort developed into logical results. Again,
one of Nature’s mysterious workings; again one of her analogies to the
inner and outer worlds of growth. As the hibernating seed, as the
child in the womb, so the thought of man. Growth without ceasing, in
light or darkness. Logical development, from the gates of Life to the
gates of Death.

Joy was so deeply in love that all her thoughts, all her acts, all her
hopings and fearings were tinged by it. Dreams need a physical basis
somewhere; and whatever is the outward condition of man or woman so
will be the mind. Whatever the inward, so will be the outward; each is
the true index to the other. Her father, though an acute enough man in
other respects, was sublimely unconscious of any change in his little
girl; indeed he held her in his mind as but a child to whom the
realities of life had not yet presented themselves. And yet even as a
father he was feeling the effects of her developed affection. All the
sweetness of her childhood had ripened. Somehow her nature had become
more buoyant, more elastic. Sweetness and thoughtful understanding of
his wishes seemed to breathe from her. Now and again were languorous
moments when her whole being seemed to yield itself involuntarily to a
wish outside her own. To a woman these are times of danger. For when
the will ceases, passivity is no longer negative; it is simply a
doubling of the external domination--as though an active spirit had
been breathed into inertness. There are many readings to any of the
Parables. When certain devils have been cast out and the house has
been swept and garnished may it not be that spirits other than devils
may find place therein. May it not also be that there is a virtue in
even selfishness; if only that its protective presence keeps out
devils that would fain enter the house where it abides.

With a spirit of meekness Joy waited the coming of the friend who had
been bidden. She had every confidence that he would come. True that he
had not written to her; but she had seen his unsigned letter to Judy,
and into its barrenness had read meanings of her own. How could he
_not_ come to her when she would have so gladly flown to him? Besides
there was always with her the memory of that rapturous moment when he
had spoken her name: “Joy look at me!” It was not hard to remember
that; it was the only time she had heard her name upon his lips. As
the weeks had gone by, that little sentence impulsively spoken had
arrived at the dignity of a declaration of passion. It had grown in
her mind from a request to a command; and she felt the sweetness of
being commanded by a man she loved. In that moment she had accepted
him as her Master; and that acceptance on a woman’s part remains as a
sacred duty of obedience so long as love lasts. This is one of the
mysteries of love. Like all other mysteries, easy of acceptance to
those who believe; an acceptance which needs no doubting
investigation, no proof, no consideration of any kind whatever. She
had faith in him, and where Faith reigns Patience ceases to be a
virtue.

Her father waited also, though not in the same meekness of spirit.
Indeed his feeling was fast becoming an exasperation in which the
feeling of gratitude was merging. He felt that he had done all that
was right and correct with regard to the young man. He had gone out of
his way to be nice to him; but with only the result of insult--that
was the way in which he was beginning to construe the silence of Mr.
Hardy. Insult to his daughter as well as himself; and that was a thing
which could not be brooked from anyone no matter how strong or how
numerous were his claims for leniency! Joy saw that there was some
cause of displeasure with her father, and with a sinking heart had to
attribute it to the real cause. She knew--which her father did
not--from his letter to Judy that Mr. Hardy would have to be away from
London just at the time of their visit; but she was afraid to speak
lest she should precipitate catastrophe. It was not that she had fear
in the ordinary sense. Much as she loved her father she would face him
if necessary. But she felt that it would be unwise to force the issue
prematurely; her father was a man of such strong prejudices--he called
them convictions!--that once they were aroused they mastered his
judgment. What might happen if he should give them scope on this
occasion! Her heart sank more deeply still at the very thought.

In her anxiety she took what was probably the wisest course; she kept
him perpetually busy, trotting about with her to see the sights of
London. This was a pleasure which she had long promised herself
with--since the adventure with the run-away horse--the added interest
of having present a nice Englishman to point out and explain. This
special charm had now to be foregone; and the denial made her secretly
sad. However, the best anodyne to pain is pain; her anxiety regarding
her father’s case was a counteractant to her own. Father and daughter
were so busy, morning noon and night, and the girl appeared to be so
tired when the day’s programme as laid down had been exhausted, that
occasion was lacking for consideration of a disagreeable subject.
Towards the end of the first week, however, Colonel Ogilvie’s patience
began to fail. He felt that he must speak of his annoyance to some
one, and there was no choice. Joy felt that the moment had come, and
she did not flinch. She had a grim foreboding that there would be
something said which would give her pain to hear. Her hands were tied.
She could not even mention that Mr. Hardy was away; her father would
be sure to ask how she knew it. If he did so, she would not dare to
tell him; for she knew well that if he learned that the man who had
not even answered his own letter was in secret correspondence with the
ladies of his own family--that is how he would put it--the fact would
add fuel to the flame, would change chagrin to fury. And so she
steeled herself to the quiet endurance of suffering.

The blow fell at breakfast time when her father had looked through the
few letters which lay beside his plate.

“Well, I do think that that young man’s rudeness is unpardonable!”

Joy looked up with a pleasant smile which belied the chilly feeling
about her heart. She felt that she must pretend ignorance; her father
might, later on, hold a too ready acceptance as suspicious:

“What, Daddy? Who? Whose rudeness?”

“That--that gentleman whom I asked to dine with us. Mr. Hardy.”

“Perhaps he may not have got your letter.”

“How do you mean, daughter? He must have got it; I directed it to the
address he gave me himself.”

“But Daddy, he may be away. You remember he told you at dinner that
day in the Holland that he had important business. It may have been
prolonged you know. He may not even be in London.”

“Then he should see that his letters are duly sent on to him.”

“Certainly he ought. But perhaps Daddy he’s not as careful as we are.
He may not be a man of business!” Colonel Ogilvie smiled:

“I’m afraid that is a very bad argument my dear. You have just used
the opposite!”

“How so, Daddy?” she asked wrinkling up her brows.

“You said he might be away on business!” He was so pleased with his
combating of her argument that her purpose was effected; he abandoned
the subject--for a time.

The next morning, however, he renewed it again under similar
circumstances:

“I think, my dear, that we had better give up any idea of keeping that
young man on the list of our friends. It is quite evident that he does
not care to continue our acquaintanceship!” Joy suffered much this
time; all the more because there was nothing that she could say which
would be wise. She had to content herself with a commonplace
acceptance of his views. So she answered with as steady a voice as she
could manage:

“Of course, Daddy! Whatever you think right!” The answer pleased her
father; he showed it in his reply:

“I am sorry about it, my dear; for he seemed a fine young fellow, and
he saved you very bravely. However we cannot help it. _We_ did all we
could to make him welcome; but we can’t force him to come to us. It
isn’t an occasion for wain-ropes!” After a pause she ventured to say
meekly:

“Yes. It would be a pity if we had to quarrel with a man who did so
much for us. I suppose if he _could_ show that he did not get your
letter, then it would be--you could forgive him.”

“Of course I would, my dear. But these English are so stand-off that
there is no understanding them. I wanted to be friends with the man
who saved my little girl … But there, it is no use wishing anything
when people are pig-headed …”

His words somehow made Joy’s heart glow. It might be all right yet, if
only …

But the present was sadly un-right. The suspense, the uncertainty, the
waiting in the dark were hard to bear. It was little wonder that in
the middle of the following week her father noticed that she had grown
pale and listless. Deep down in his mind he connected it somehow with
“that damned fellow” but he took care not to betray his thought to his
daughter in any way. His present wish was that even the existence of
the fellow should fall out of the memory of his family. As for himself
he never let a grievance fall out of his memory; there had to be a day
of reckoning for all concerned in such.

He quietly made preparations for their northern tour, and when all was
ready told Joy who joined with alacrity in the move. London was now
growing hateful to her.


In the meantime Athlyne, living either in his castle of
Ceann-da-Shail--which he had long looked on as his home--as a centre,
was flying about in his new motor, learning each day fresh mysteries
of driving. The speeds of the motor are so much above those of other
vehicles that a driver, howsoever experienced he may be in other ways,
seems here to be dealing with a new force. The perspective changes so
fast as the machine eats up the space that the mind requires to be
practised afresh in judging distances and curves. It had been a bitter
regret to him that he had to keep out of London just when Joy had come
to it. His mind was always running on what a delight it would be to be
with her when all the interesting things came before her; to note the
sudden flushes of delight, to see the quick lifting of the beautiful
eyes, to look into their mysterious, bewildering depths. At first when
such ideas took him whilst driving, he nearly ran into danger.
Unconsciously his hands would turn the wheel for speed, and in his
eagerness he would make such swerves and jumps that undesirable things
almost happened. However, after a few such experiences his nerves
learned their own business. It is part of the equipment of a chauffeur
to be able to abstract and control his driving senses from all other
considerations; and such dual action of the mind requires habit and
experience for its realisation. The constant watchfulness and anxiety
had at least this beneficent use: that for a part of the day at all
events his mind was kept from brooding over his personal trouble.

The arrival of Colonel Ogilvie’s letter, sent on to him from London,
made in a way a new trouble for him; for whilst he was delighted to
get so friendly an overture it was he saw but another difficulty ahead
of him. He must either reply in his false name, which was now hateful
to him; or he must leave the letter, for the present, unanswered. This
latter alternative would be dangerous with a man so sensitive and so
punctilious; but, all told, it was the lesser evil. He had had
opportunity to make up his mind on the subject before the letter came,
for Aunt Judy had said in her last letter that Colonel Ogilvie had
spoken about writing to him before they should arrive in London. Still
it was a sore trial to him to be so discourteous, with the added
chagrin that it might--probably would--stand in his way with the one
man in the world whom he wished to propitiate.

As he did not know anything about the history of Colonel Ogilvie’s
family he went to the peerage books and made lists of the bearers of
that name in its different spellings; and then as he decided to go to
many of the places named, he made runs into Perthshire and Forfar. He
came to the conclusion that he must have misunderstood Colonel Ogilvie
in alluding to the “Border Counties.” He laid up, however, a good deal
of local information which might be pleasing to his prospective
father-in-law.

One morning he had a letter which quite fluttered him. It was from
Aunt Judy telling him that Colonel Ogilvie had announced his intention
of starting on the then coming Thursday for the north, and that he had
given as the direction of his letters till further notice the “Inn of
Greeting,” Ambleside. The unqualified pleasure which he received from
this news was neutralised by the postscript:


“By the way--this of course in your private ear, now and
hereafter--Colonel Ogilvie is vastly disappointed that you have not
been to see him in London, and that you have not even replied to his
letter. Surely there must be some mistake about this. I sincerely hope
so, for he looks on any breach of courtesy, or any defect in it, as an
unpardonable sin. I know from the fact of his mentioning it to his
womenkind that he has taken it to heart. Do, do my dear friend, who
have done so much for us and whose friendship we wish to hold, repair
this without delay. He is an old man and may possibly expect more from
a younger man than from one of his own standing. I am sure that if
there has been any omission there is on your part a good reason for
it. But do not lose any time. If you wish to please us _all_--and I am
sure you do--you would do well to go up to Ambleside--if you have not
seen him already--and call on him there. And do like a dear man drop
me a line at once to say you have received this and telling me what
you intend to do.”


He sat for a while quite still, putting his thoughts in order. It was
now Monday so that Colonel Ogilvie would have been already some days
at Ambleside. He took it for granted that Joy was with him, but he
could not help a qualm of doubt about even that. Aunt Judy had not
mentioned her in the matter. The only possible allusion was in the
underlining of the word “all.” Otherwise the letter was too direct and
too serious for any cryptic meaning.

He came to the conclusion that his best plan would be to go at once to
some place on Windermere, and from there go quietly to Ambleside and
find out for himself how things lay. The best place for him to stay at
would, for his purposes, be Bowness. There he would leave his car with
the chauffeur and drive in a carriage to Ambleside. When there he
would contrive to meet if possible Joy alone. He would surely be able
to form from her attitude some opinion of her disposition towards him.
If he were satisfied as to this he would at once go to her father,
tell him the whole story, and place himself in his hands.

But then he thought that if he were so near, his name might become
known to Colonel Ogilvie; that infernal alias seemed to be always
standing in his way! He was so obsessed by the subject that at times
he quite overlooked the fact that neither the Colonel nor any of his
family knew anything whatever of the matter. It took him an hour’s
hard thought before this idea presented itself to him. It took a
weight off his mind. If by any chance Colonel Ogilvie should hear that
an individual called Lord Athlyne was in the neighbourhood it would
mean nothing to him. Nothing except the proximity of one more of that
“bloated aristocracy,” which one class of Americans run down--and
another run after.

He was then up in Ross. As he did not wish to “rush” matters he
decided to start next day. When that time came he had fully made up
his plan of action. As the Ogilvies were at Ambleside he would go to
Bowness. As there was a service of public coaches he could go between
the places mentioned--without even the isolation of a carriage for his
sole use. He would go quietly to the Inn of Greeting and learn what he
could about their movements. The rest must depend on circumstances.
But there must be no hurry; the matter was too serious now and the
issue too important to take any risk. But when he should have seen Joy
and knew, or believed, or understood … Then he would lose not a
moment in seeing her father. But he might not get a chance of seeing
him alone and under circumstances favourable to his purpose. He must
be ready. All at once an idea struck him …

All these weeks Athlyne had now and again had a vague feeling of
uneasiness which he could not understand: a sort of feeling that he
would some time wake and wonder what he had been fretting and fuming
about. Why could he not have written to Colonel Ogilvie at any time?
Even before he had left New York, or whilst he had been on board ship,
or whilst the American family had been in Italy, or even when the
Colonel had been in London? Why not now? After all, there was nothing
in any way wrong; nothing to be ashamed of. He was of good social
position; at least as good as Joy’s father was. He was himself rich
and wanted no fortune with his wife. He had won certain honours--a man
to whose name had been suffixed V.C. and D.S.O. must be considered
personally adequate for ordinary purposes. And so on. Vanity and
self-interest, in addition to the working of the higher qualities,
supplied many good reasons.

And yet! … He was always being brought up against one of two things:
Colonel Ogilvie’s peculiar views and character, or his own position
towards him with regard to the alias. He could always find in either
of these something which might cause pain or trouble to Joy. Moreover
there was another matter which was a powerful factor in his
conclusions, although it was one which he did not analyse or even
realise. It was one that worked unconsciously; a disposition rather
than an activity; a tendency rather than a thought. Lord Athlyne was
Scotch and Irish; a Celt of Celts on his mother’s side. He had all
that underlying desire of the unknown which creates sentiment, and
which is so pronounced a part of the Celtic character. This it is
whence comes that clinging to the place of birth which has made the
peasantry of the Green Isle for seven hundred years fight all opposing
forces, from hunger to bayonets, to hold possession of their own. This
it is which animated a race, century after century, to suffer and
endure from their Conquerors of a more prosaic race all sorts of pain
and want, and for reasons not understandable by others. Those who have
lived amongst those Celts of the outlying fringes, amongst whom racial
tendencies remain unaltered by changing circumstances, and by whom
traditions are preserved not by historical purpose but by the exercise
of faith, know that there is a Something which has a name but no
external bounds or limitations, no quick principle, no settled
purpose. Something which to an alien can only be described by
negatives; if any idea can at all be arrived at by such--any idea
however rudimentary, phantasmal or vague--it can only be acquired at
all by a process of exclusions. The name is “The Gloom”; the rest is a
birthright. Those who can understand it need no telling or explaining;
others can no more understand it than those born without eyes can see.
It is a quality opposed to no other; it can exist with any. It can
co-exist with fighting, with song, with commerce. It makes no change
in other powers or qualities of the children of Adam. Those who
possess it can be good or bad, clever or silly, heroic or mean. It can
add force to imagination, understand nature, give quiet delight or
spiritual pain. And the bulk of those who have it do not think of it
or even know it: or if they do, hardly ever speak of it.

Athlyne had his full share of it. Being young and strong and of a
class in life which seldom lacks amusement he had not been given to
self-analysis. But all the same, though he did not think of it, the
force was there. In his present emotional crisis it brought the lover
in him up to the Celtic ideal. An ideal so strangely saturated with
love that his whole being, his aims and ambitions, his hopes and
fears, his pleasures and pains yielded place to it and for the time
became merged in it. To him the whole world seemed to revolve round
Joy as a pivotal point. Nothing could be of any use or interest which
did not have touch of her or lead to her. So, he wanted to know beyond
the mere measure of intellectual belief if Joy loved him or was on the
way to doing so. When he was satisfied as to this he would be free to
act; but not before.

On the journey he had allowed the chauffeur to drive, as he wanted to
think over the whole matter without fear of interruption. He had sat
in the tonneau and made from time to time notes in his pocket-book. He
had now made up his mind that he would write a letter to Colonel
Ogilvie telling him the whole circumstances. This he would keep in his
pocket so that at the first moment when he was satisfied as to Joy’s
views he could post it, in case he could not have the opportunity of a
personal explanation. After dinner the second night of the journey and
then in his bedroom he sat up writing the letter and then copying it
out on his own note paper of which he had for the purpose brought a
supply with him. When it was completed it left nothing that he could
think of open to doubt. When he had got this off his mind sleep came
to him.

Next day he took the wheel himself; and that day when there was
fitting opportunity the car hummed along merrily at top speed. Before
sunset they arrived at Bowness. There he left the car in charge of the
chauffeur, on whom he again impressed the necessity for absolute
silence. The man was naturally discreet, and he saw that he was in a
good situation. Athlyne was satisfied on leaving him that his orders
would be thoroughly carried out.

In the forenoon of the next day he took the steamer which plies along
the Lake, and in due course landed at Ambleside. His heart beat
quickly now and his eyes searched keenly all around him as he moved.
He would not miss a chance of seeing Joy.




 CHAPTER XI.
 THE BEAUTIFUL TWILIGHT

The first couple of days at Ambleside were a delight to Joy. In the
change from the roar and ceaseless whirl of London was such a sense of
peace that it influenced even the pain of her heart-hunger. Here in
this lovely place, where despite the life and movement of the little
town nature seemed to reign, was something to calm nerves overstrung
with waiting and apprehension. It was a relief to her at first, a
pleasure later, to walk about the pleasant roads with her father; to
take long drives beneath shady trees or up on the hillside where the
lake lay below like a panorama; to sit on the steamer’s deck and drift
along the beautiful lake.

Her father was now and again impatient, not with her but because of
the non-arrival of the motor which he had ordered in London. It had
not been quite ready when they left and so it was arranged that it
should follow them. He wanted to have it in possession so that they
could fly all over the region; the American in him was clamorous for
movement, for speed and progress! He kept up an endless telegraphing
with the motor people in London, and when at last they wired that the
car was nearly ready he got a map and traced out the route. Each day
he marked out a space that he thought it ought to have covered,
crediting it for every hour of daylight with top speed. After all, no
matter what our ages may be, we are but children and the new toy but
renews the old want and the old impatience; bringing in turn the old
disillusionment and the old empty-hearted discontent. And the new toy
may be of any shape: even that of a motor-car--or a beating human
heart.

Partly out of affection for her father and so from sympathy with him,
and partly as a relief to herself, Joy looked eagerly for the coming
of the car. She used to go with him to the post office when he was
sending his telegrams. Indeed she never left him; and be sure he was
glad of her companionship. Now and again would come over her an
overwhelming wave of disappointment--grief--regret--she knew not
what--when she thought of the friendship so romantically begun but
failing so soon. The letters from Aunt Judy used to worry and even
humiliate her. For Judy could not understand why there was no meeting;
and her questions, made altogether for the girl’s happiness but made
in the helplessness of complete ignorance, gave her niece new concern.
She had to give reasons, invent excuses. This in itself, for she was
defending the man, only added fuel to her own passion. Joy’s love was
ripening very fast; all her nature was yielding to it. Each day seemed
to make her a trifle thinner. Her eyes seemed to grow bigger and at
times to glow like lamps. Whenever she could, she kept looking out on
the road by which He might come. Walking or driving or in the hotel it
was all the same. In the sitting-room her seat was near the window,
her place at table where she could command a view. All this added to
her beauty and so her father took no concern from it. He thought she
was looking well; and as she was hearty and always, whilst with him,
in good spirits and vivacious and even eager in her movements, he was
more than satisfied.

One morning as she was sitting alone close to the window, presumably
reading for she had a book in her lap, she caught sight with the tail
of her eye of a figure that she knew. There was no mistaking on her
part that tall, upright man with the springy step; the image was too
deeply burned into her heart for that. For a fraction of a second her
heart stood still; and then the wave of feeling went over her.
Instinctively she drew back and kept her head low so that only her
eyes were over the line of the window sill. She did not wish to be
recognised--all at once. With the realisation of her woman’s wishes
came all the instinctive exercise of her woman’s wiles. He was walking
so slowly that she had time to observe him fully, to feast her eyes on
him. He was looking up at the hotel, not eagerly she thought, but
expectantly. This, though it did not chill her, somehow put her on
guard. She slipped behind the window curtain and peeped cautiously. As
he came closer to the hotel he went still more slowly. He did not come
to the door as she expected, but moved along the street.

This all puzzled her; puzzled her very much. She knew that Judy had
written to him of their coming to London, she had seen his reply to
her letter; and Judy with her usual thoughtful kindness had
mentioned--as though by chance, for she was the very soul of kindly
discretion--that when she knew what locality and hotel had been fixed
on for the visit to the Lakes she would tell him. It was evident, that
he knew they were there and in the hotel; why, then, did he not come
to see them. How she would have hurried, she thought, had she been the
man and loved as she did! She had no doubting whatever of his good
faith. “Perfect love casteth out fear.” And doubt is but fear in a
timid form. She accepted in simple good faith that he had some purpose
or reason of his own. Her manifest duty to him, therefore, was not to
let any wish or act of hers clash with it. So she set herself to think
it all out, feeling in reality far happier than she had done for many
weeks. It was not merely that she had, after long waiting, seen the
man; but she was now able to do something for him--if indeed it was
only the curbing of her own curiosity, her own desires.

She rose quietly and went to her bed-room which was at another side of
the house--on the side towards which He had passed. Her father was
writing letters and would not want her; he had said at breakfast that
he would not be able to go out for an hour or two. In her room she
went cautiously to her window and, again hiding behind the curtains,
glanced into the street. She felt quite sad when she only saw his back
as he walked slowly along. Every now and again he would stop and look
round him as though admiring the place and the views as the openings
between the houses allowed him to see the surrounding country. Once or
twice she could see him look out under his eyebrows as though watching
the hotel without appearing to do so. Presently he turned the corner
of the next street to the left, moving as though he wished to go all
round the hotel.

She sat down and thought, her heart beating hard. Her face was covered
with both her hands. Forehead and cheeks and neck were deeply flushed;
and when she took away her hands her eyes were bright and seemed to
glow. She seemed filled with happiness, but all the same looked
impossibly demure; as is woman’s nature, playing to convention even
when alone.

Before she left her room she had changed her clothes, putting on after
several experiments the frock which she thought the most becoming. She
did not send for her maid, but did everything for herself; even to
hanging up the discarded frocks. Then she went back to the sitting
room and took as before her seat at the window, keeping however a
little more in the background. She wanted to see rather than to be
seen. With her eyes seemingly on her book, but in reality sweeping
under her lashes the approaches to the hotel like searchlights, she
sat quite quietly for some time. At length the eyes suddenly fell for
an instant under an uncontrollable wave of diffidence; she had seen
Him pass into the garden opposite to the hotel and go secretively
behind some lilac bushes opposite the doorway. But after that one
droop of the eyes, there was scarce even the flicker of an eyelid; she
did not want to lose a single glimpse of him.

Sitting by the window, where he could see her, for a full hour until
her father appeared, she thought over the new phase of the matter. If
she had ever had any real doubt as to whether Mr. Richard Hardy loved
her it was all resolved now. For certain he loved her--and as much,
she hoped, as she loved him! He had sought her out at Ambleside; for
even in her own secret mind she never went through the pretence of
trying to persuade herself that it may have been some one else that he
was looking for.

But why was he so secret? Why did he not come at once into the hotel
and ask to see her father. He had been invited to come; he had been
made a welcome guest at the Holland. He knew their movements; he had
written to Judy. But why did he keep so aloof? If he wanted to avoid
them altogether he had only to keep away. Why then did he keep coming
round the house and looking at it secretively? She was absolutely at a
standstill every time her thinking led her to this _impasse_. But, all
the same, she never questioned or doubted the man. In her own mind she
was sure that he had some good reason for all he did; and it was her
duty not to thwart but to help him.

She had already accepted the position of a true wife, a true lover:
The man’s will was law!

Then her thoughts turned as to how best she could help him. Here all
her brains as well as all the instincts of her womanhood came into
play; and this is a strong combination in a man’s service. Her
arguments ran:

As he evidently wishes his presence to be unknown she must not seem to
know of it.

As he evidently wanted to know something about her she would take care
that he knew what he wished, so far as she could know or effect it.

As (perhaps) he wished to see her (from afar, or at all events without
proclaiming himself) she would take care that he would have plenty of
opportunities.

But as he did not want Daddy to see him--at present (this last
qualification she insisted on to herself) she would have to be careful
that her father did not notice his presence. This she felt would be
difficult, and might be dangerous; she feared that if the two men
should meet just at present (another qualification equally insisted
on) her father might make some quarrel or trouble.

As Daddy might make trouble this way, she must keep very close to him.
She might thus be able to smooth matters, or do _something_ if any
occasion came.

_And_ she must be careful that he did not notice that she saw him.
This argument came straight out of her sex-artfulness. Every instinct
of her being told her that such would be the most effective way of
bringing the man to her. And Oh! but she did long to see him, close to
her where they could see each other clearly. “Look at me!” seemed to
throb through her every nerve, and make a clang of great music in her
brain.

When presently Colonel Ogilvie, having finished his letters, asked her
what she would like to do that morning she said she would like to go
for a drive. She knew that there would be more security in the
isolation of a carriage than when walking, where a chance meeting
might occur at any moment.

When Athlyne, who was watching the hotel from the garden where the
shrubs gave him cover, saw the landau at the door he thought he would
wait and see if by any chance it might be for the Ogilvies’ use. His
hopes were justified when he saw Joy follow her father from the
doorway. She looked radiantly beautiful; so beautiful that all his
love and passion surged up in him till he felt almost suffocated. He
had quite a good view of her, for she stood for a minute or two in
front of the horses giving them lumps of sugar and stroking their
noses. He heard the voices of both father and daughter. Colonel
Ogilvie’s was strong and resonant; Joy’s was sweet and clear.
Moreover, she spoke on purpose a little more loudly than usual; she
knew that He was listening and would like to hear her voice.

“Tell him where you would like to go, little girl.”

“Anywhere you think best, coachman; provided we get a good view. We
had better be back here in about an hour. Then, Daddy, we shall keep
quiet after lunch--if that will suit you, dear. After tea we can go
out again and have a long drive and come back in the lovely English
twilight. Of course if you would like to, Daddy. I must say there is
one institution that I wish we had in America.”

“And what is that daughter?”

“The twilight! Since I have seen it, our own night seems very cruel!
It shuts down too fast. For my own part if ever I fall in love----”
here the words became indistinct; she was entering the carriage.

She had chosen her words on purpose. She wished to let Him know the
plans for the day. She knew well that at the end of the hour he would
be waiting, hidden in the garden, to see their return. Thus he would
see her again, and she by going quickly to the window would perhaps
see him again. She had spoken of not going out again till after tea,
because she did not wish to keep him all day at his post; she knew
that this would happen if he were in ignorance of her movements. He,
poor fellow! would have to get lunch. … She was exercising for him
already the solicitude of a wife for a husband. As to the remarks
about twilight, that had a double origin. Firstly it was quite true;
she had long had it in her mind. Secondly it was a sort of _ballon
d’essai_; it might point or lead somewhere. Where that might be she
knew not; but she had a vague hopeful feeling that there was an
answer--somewhere.

As to the remark about ever loving. Well! she could not have explained
that herself. All she knew was that she had a sudden desire to mention
the word. …

Athlyne profited by the lesson; but his acts were not quite what Joy
had anticipated. She, thinking from the feminine standpoint, had taken
it that he would remain at his post until the return and then avail
himself of the longer period for rest and food. But Athlyne was a
soldier and had as such long ago learned the maxim that in route
marching the camp should be set beyond the bridge. Moreover in the
strenuous life of the Boer war he had superadded the wisdom of taking
his meal at the first opportunity. As soon as the carriage had
disappeared from view he went straight into the hotel and ordered his
lunch in the Coffee-room. He was really hungry, and the lamb and salad
were excellent; but had he not been hungry, and had the food been
poor, he would have enjoyed it without knowing its inferiority.
Everything was good to him this morning; he had seen Joy!

He was out in the garden in good time. Fortunately so, from his point
of view. For Joy, believing that he would be still waiting, kept the
coachman up to time. It might well have been that they had met in the
hall.

The drive had increased the girl’s loveliness, if such were possible.
Her eyes were bright, there was fine colour in her cheeks, and her
voice and manner were full of vivacity. The bright sun and the sweet,
strong air had braced her; and perhaps some inward emotion had
exercised the same effect. One quick glance under her eyelashes as
they drove towards the hotel had shewn her the outline of a tall
figure close to the lilacs in the garden. As her father helped her
from the carriage with all his habitual gallantry of manner she said
in a clear voice--Athlyne across the street heard every word:

“That drive was exquisite! Wasn’t it Daddy? Thank you so much for it!
The lights and shadows on the hills were simply divine. It would be
nice to go again to-morrow in something of the same direction. We
might go about the same hour, if it would suit you, and see the same
effects again!”

When they had gone in Athlyne waited a little while in the garden. He
sat in the sunshine on a garden seat placed in the centre of the grass
plot. He was not afraid of being seen at present, and as he knew that
Joy and her father were in the house he did not even try to look for
them. Had he chosen a position for the purpose of giving Joy pleasure
he could not have done better than this. From behind her window
curtain she could see him plainly. To her he made a beautiful picture,
of which the natural setting was complete: the background of sweet
pale lilac, the dropping gold of the laburnum and the full red of
scarlet hawthorn; his feet in the uncut grass starred with daisies.
She had a long, long view of him, watching every movement and
expression with eager eyes. One thing he did which she could not
understand. He took from his breast pocket an envelope; this he opened
and took from it a letter. Instead of reading it, however, he sat for
a long time with it in his hand. Then with a quick movement he put it
back in the envelope, moistened the flap with his lips and closed it.
Joy’s idea had been that it might have been Judy’s letter which he had
intended to re-read; but this could not be. For an instant a spasm of
pain had gripped her heart as the thought came that it might have been
from some other woman. But that idea she swept aside imperiously. Now
she knew that it was some letter of his own, and the questioning of
her brain began to assail her heart:

Whom could he be writing to? What could he be writing about? Why did
he have a finished letter in his pocket, not even sealed up?

If she had known the truth she would have sat quiet, not with
perturbation but in a silent ecstasy. Athlyne had made up his mind
that if occasion did not serve for his seeing Joy alone he would send
the letter to Colonel Ogilvie and risk being refused. In such case he
would have to take another course, and try to obtain her consent in
spite of her father’s wishes. He did not, however, intend to send the
letter yet. His first hope was too sweet to abandon without good
cause. His closing the letter was but an impulsive expression of his
feeling.

Suddenly he stood up and moved out of the garden. This did not puzzle
her, but awoke all her curiosity. She had a wild desire to see where
he was going; but as she could not follow him she made up her mind to
present patience. She watched from her window till he had passed out
of sight. She was glad that she was concealed behind the curtain when
she saw him at the furthest point of sight turn and give a long look
back at the hotel. Then she went to her room to get ready for lunch.

Athlyne felt that he must do something to let off steam. Movement of
some kind was necessary in his present frame of mind. For his pleasure
was not unmixed. He had seen Joy, and she was looking more radiantly
beautiful than ever. But she had said one thing that sent a pang
through him: “if I ever fall in love.” There could hardly be any doubt
of her sincerity; she was talking to her father quite alone and
unconscious that he of all men was within earshot. “If I ever fall in
love,” that meant that she had not yet done so. It would be wise to
wait before sending the letter so that he might see if that happy time
had come or had even begun to peep above the horizon. Unconsciously he
took from his pocket the letter and his pocket-book, put the former
into the latter and returned it to its place.

Athlyne was no fool; but he was only a man, and as such took for
gospel every word spoken by the woman he loved. Had Joy been present
and known his difficulty, and had cared to express herself then as she
would have done later, she would have smiled at him as she said:

“Why you dear old goose how could I fall in love with you when I had
done that already!”

Had Aunt Judy been commenting on the comment she would have said in
her genial cynicism:

“A woman--or a man either--can only fall in love once in a life time;
with the same person!”

Athlyne telephoned his chauffeur to whom he had already sent a wire to
be prepared, and in a time to be computed by minutes met him outside
Ambleside. There he took the wheel himself, telling the man to meet
him a little before five o’clock. He felt that he must be alone. He
went slowly so long as he was near the town; but when he found himself
on a clear road, over which he could see for a long way ahead, the
index went round to “speed” and as the car swept over the ground its
rush kept pace with his own thoughts.

He went about a hundred miles before he regained anything like calm.
Trying afterwards to recall the sequence of his thoughts he never
could arrive at any sort of conclusion regarding them.

The only thing definite in his mind was that he wanted to see Joy
again, and soon. He knew they would be starting out after tea time
which meant, he knew, something after five o’clock; and not for a
world of chrysolite would he miss being there. Outside Ambleside he
met the chauffeur whom he sent back to Bowness; he did not want his
car to be too much _en evidence_ at Ambleside at present. He had a
wash and a cup of tea at another hotel; and at five strolled back to
his nook in the garden.

By this time Joy had made up her mind that he _might_ come back that
evening though--with still her protective instinct, partly for herself
but more for him--she had quite made up her mind that even if he
should not come she would not be disappointed. He was not to be blamed
in any way, now or hereafter. How could he be? It would not be fair. A
few minutes before five she took her place at the window, but sitting
so far back this time that she could not be seen from without. She
herself could see out, but only by raising her head high. This she did
now and again, but very cautiously. She felt a sort of diffidence, a
certain measure of shamefacedness lest he should see her again and
suspect anything. We are very sensitive as to the discovery of truth
by others when we are ourselves trying to deceive ourselves! The few
minutes passed slowly, very slowly. Then when once more she looked out
a great thrill of joy shook her. He _had_ come. If doubt there had
been, it could no longer exist. Her heart beat, her face flushed, she
trembled with a sort of ecstasy; the waves of high passion swept her.
She was half inclined to stand boldly in the window and let him see
her; to let him see that she saw him; to run out to him and fall into
his arms. There is no boldness that love will not commit when it is
true! She felt this, though not consciously. There was no need for
consciousness, for thought, for argument. She knew!

It was perhaps just as well that her father came into the room. He
brought a sense of sanity with him; she felt that consciously enough.
Her mere faint sigh of regret was sufficient proof.

Joy did not walk down the staircase; she floated, as though matter had
ceased to exist and the soul was free. She stood for a minute on the
step looking out at the view; but presently kept changing her pose so
that her face might be seen with both profiles, as well as the full
face. If He had come there to see her He should not be
disappointed--if she could help it.

That drive was a dream, an ecstasy. At first there was a miserable
sense that each turn of the wheels took them farther apart; but
shortly this was lost in the overwhelming sense of gladness. She could
have sung--danced--shouted. She wanted some physical expression of her
feeling. Then the excitement settled down to a quiet tingling
happiness, a sense of peace which was ineffable and complete.

   “… if that all of animated nature
   Be but organic harps diversely framed
   That tremble into thought as o’er them sweeps
   Plastic and vast one intellectual breeze
   At once the soul of each and God of all.”

So sung, a century before, a poet of that sweet cult of the school
centred in the very area in which she moved; and if his thoughts were
true there was a true act of worship that sunny afternoon on the
rising hills beyond the lakehead. For happiness is not merely to be at
rest. It is to be with God, to carry out to the full His wish that His
children should appreciate and enjoy the powers and good things given
them by His hands. And when that happiness is based on love--and there
is no true happiness on aught that is not high--the love itself is of
the soul and quivers with the flapping of its wings. Then indeed can
we realize that marvellous promise of the words of the Master:

“Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.” Wordsworth and
those who held with him saw God and worshipped Him in those myriad
beauties of the lake they loved; and as the beauty and its immortal
truth soothed and purified their souls, so was the spirit of the
love-sick girl cleansed of all dross. How at such a time, when the
soul swam free in grateful worship, was there place for anything that
was not clean? Her father thought, as he looked at her and heard the
ring of her voice, that he had never seen her look better or happier.
She was full of spirits, gay, sweet, tender; and yet there was over
her such a grace of gentle gravity that the old man felt himself
saying to himself:

“My little girl is a woman!”

That mellow afternoon was to her lovely; the trees and shrubs, the
flowers, the fields. The singing of the birds was ethereal music; the
lights and shadows were the personal manifestation of Nature’s God.
Her heart, her sympathy, her nature were at full tide; all overflowing
and in their plenitude full.

The long summer afternoon faded into the softness of twilight during
the homeward journey. Perhaps it was the yielding to its mysterious
influence which made Joy so still; perhaps it was that she was drawing
nearer to the man whom she adored. Her father neither knew nor took
note of it. He saw that his little girl was silent in an ecstasy of
happiness in that soft twilight of which she had spoken so tenderly;
and he was content. He too sat silent, yielding himself to the
influence of the beauty around him.

When they reached the hotel Joy seemed to wake from a dream; but she
lost none of her present placidity, none of her content. One form of
happiness had given way to another, that was all. As she stood on the
steps, waiting whilst her father was giving the coachman his
instructions for the morrow, she tried to peer into the lilac bushes
in the garden. She had a sort of intuition--nay more that an
intuition, an actual certainty--that He was again behind them. And
once more she so stood and moved that he might see her face as he
would. When her father turned to come in she took his arm and pointed
to the sky:

“Oh look, Daddy, the beautiful twilight! Is it not exquisite!” Then
impulsively she put her hand to her lips and threw a kiss to it--over
the square by way of the lilacs. Her voice was languishing music as
she said softly, but clearly enough to heard in the garden:

“Good night; Good night beloved! Good night! Good night!”

And Athlyne peering through the bushes heard the words with a beating
of his heart which made his temples throb. His only wish at the moment
was that it might have been that the words had been addressed to him.

That evening before going to dress for dinner Joy went to the window
and pulled aside the blind so that she stood outside it. The dusk was
now thick; the day had gone, but the moon had not yet risen. It was
impossible to see much; only the outline of the trees, and out on the
grass the shadowy form of a man seated. There was one faint red spark
of brightness, face high, such as might be the tip of a cigar.

When she came back into the room her father raised his face from his
book:

“Why how pale you are little girl. I am afraid that long drive must
have tired you. You were quite rosy when we arrived home. You had
better sleep it out in the morning. If mother sees you pale she will
blame me, you know. And Judy--well Judy will be Judy in her own way.”




 CHAPTER XII.
 ECHO OF A TRAGEDY

Athlyne had one other day almost similar to the last. This time he
came to Ambleside a little earlier; fortunately so, for Joy had got up
early. When he came into the square she was standing in the window
looking out. Not in his direction; did a woman ever do such a stupid
thing when at the first glance she had caught sight of the man far
off. No, this time she appeared to be eagerly watching two tiny
children toddling along the street hand in hand. He had time for a
good look at her before she changed her position. This was only when
the children had disappeared--and he had gained the shelter of the
lilacs.

Love is a blindness--in certain ways. It never once occurred to
Athlyne that Joy might have seen him, might have even known of his
being at Ambleside or in its neighbourhood. Any independent onlooker
or any one not bound by the simplicity and unquestioning faith of
ardent love would at least have doubted whether there was not some
possible intention in Joy’s movements. His faith however saved him
from pain, that one pain from which true love can suffer however
baseless it may be--doubt. Early morning took him to Ambleside; he
only went back to Bowness when those windows of the hotel which he
knew were darkened for the night.

The second day of waiting and watching was just like the first, with
only the addition that the hearts of both the young people were more
clamant, each to each; and that the rising passion of each was harder
to control. The same routine of going out and returning was observed
by the Ogilvies, and each of the lovers had tumultuous moments when
the other was within view. More than once Athlyne was tempted to put
his letter in the post or to leave it at the hotel; but each time
Joy’s chance phrase: “If I ever fall in love” came back to him as a
grim warning. He knew that if he once declared himself to Colonel
Ogilvie the whole truth must come out, and then his title and fortune
might be extraneous inducements to the girl. Whenever he came to this
point in his reasoning he thrust the letter deeper into his pocket and
his lips shut tight. He would win Joy on his mere manhood and his
manhood’s love--if at all!

By the post next morning Colonel Ogilvie and Joy both got letters from
Italy. That of the former was from his wife who announced that they
were just starting for London where they wished to remain for a few
days in order to do some shopping. When this was done she would wire
him and he could run up to London and bring them down with him. This
pleased him, for he was certain that by then he would have his
automobile. He felt in a way that his pride was at stake on this
point. He had told his women folk that the car would be ready, and he
wished to justify. He wired off at once to the agents, in even a
sterner spirit than usual, as to the cause of delay. For excuses had
come in a most exasperating way. Long after it had been reported that
the car had started and had even proceeded a considerable distance on
the way he was told that there had been an error and that by some
strange mistake the progress made by a car long previously ordered by
another customer had been reported; but that Colonel Ogilvie’s
esteemed order was well in hand and that delivery of the car was
daily--hourly--expected; and that at once on its receipt by the writer
it would be forwarded to Ambleside either with a trusty chauffeur or
by train as the purchaser might wish. Colonel Ogilvie fumed but was
powerless. He wanted the car and at once; so it was useless for him to
cancel the contract. He could only wait and hope; and console himself
with such attenuated expressions of disapproval as were permissible in
the ethics of the telegraphic system.

Joy’s letter was from Judy. It was in her usual bright style and full
of affection, sympathy and understanding, as was customary in her
letters to her niece. Judy had of late been much disturbed in her mind
about the future, and as she feared Joy might be taking to heart the
same matters as she did and in the same way, she tried to help the
other. She knew from Colonel Ogilvie’s letters to his wife which they
talked over together that he was seriously hurt and pained by the
neglect of Mr. Hardy. Indeed in his last letter he had declared that
in spite of the high opinion he had formed of him from his brave and
ready action he never wished to see his face again. To Judy this meant
much, the most that could be of possible ill; Joy’s happiness might be
at stake. The aunt, steeped through and through with knowledge of the
world and character--a knowledge gained from her own heart, its hopes
and pains and from bitter experience of the woes of others--knew that
her niece would suffer deeply in case of any rupture between her
father and the man who had saved her life. It was not merely from
imaginative sympathy that she derived her belief. She had had many and
favourable opportunities of studying Joy closely, and she had in her
own mind no doubt whatever that the girl’s affections were given
beyond recall to the handsome stranger. So in her letter she tried to
guard her from the pain of present imaginings and yet to prepare her
subtly for the possibility of disappointment in the future. Her letter
in its important part ran:


“Your father is undoubtedly very angry with Mr. Hardy; and though I
believe that his anger may have a slight basis it is altogether
excessive. We do not know yet what Mr. Hardy’s limitations of freedom
may be. After all, darling, we do not know anything as yet of his
circumstances or his surroundings. He may have a thousand calls on his
time which we neither know nor understand. For all we can tell he may
have a wife already--though this I do not believe or accept for a
moment. And you don’t either, my dear! Of course this is all a joke.
We _know_ he is free as to marriage, though I don’t believe his heart
is--Eh! Puss! But seriously if you ever get a chance tell him to try
to be very nice to your father. Old men are often more sensitive in
some things that young ones, more sensitive than even we women are
supposed to be. So when he does come to see you both--for he _will_
come soon (if he hasn’t come already)--don’t keep him all to yourself,
but contrive somehow that your father can have a little chat with him.
You needn’t go altogether away you know, my dear. Don’t sit so far
away that he can’t see you nor you him (this is a whisper expressed in
writing) and I dare say you will like to hear all they say to each
other. But if he says a word about seeing your daddy alone for a
moment, if he begins to look ill at ease or to get red and then pale
and red again, or stammers and clears his throat do you just get up
quietly and go out of the room without a word in the most natural way
in the world, just as if you were doing some little household duty. I
suppose I needn’t tell you this; you know it just as well as I do,
though I have known it by experience and you can not. You know how I
know it darling though I never told you this part of it. Women are
Cowards. _We_ know it though we don’t always say so, and we even
disguise it from others now and then. But in such a time as I have
mentioned we are _all_ Cowards. We couldn’t stay if we would. We
_want_ to get away and hide our heads just as we do when it thunders.
But what an awful lot of _rot_ I am talking. When Mr. Hardy and your
father meet they will, I am sure, have plenty to talk about without
either you or me being the subject of it. They are both sportsmen and
fond of horses--and a lot of things. It is only if they don’t meet
that I am afraid of. I am writing by the way to Mr. Hardy this post to
know where he is at present and where he has been. I shall of course
write you when I hear; or if there be anything important I shall wire.
We are off to London and it is possible that whilst we are there we
may have unexpected meetings with all sorts of friends and calls from
them. I hope, darling, that by the time we reach Ambleside we shall
find you _blooming_, full of happiness and health and freshness, the
very embodiment of your name.”


The letter both disquieted Joy and soothed her. There were suggestions
of fear, but there was also a consistent strain of hope. Judy would
never have said such things if she did not believe them. Moreover she
herself knew what Judy did not; her aunt hadn’t peeped from behind
window blinds at a tall figure behind lilac bushes or sitting in the
darkness with only a fiery cigar tip to mark his presence. Poor Judy!
The girl’s sympathetic heart, made more sympathetic by her own burning
love, ached when she thought of the older woman’s lonely, barren life.
She too had loved--and been loved; had hoped and feared, and waited.
The very knowledge of how a woman would feel when the man was asking
formally for parental sanction disclosed something of which the girl
had never thought. She had always known Judy in such a motherly and
elderly aspect that she had never realised the possibility of her
having ever been in love; any more that she had given consideration to
the love-making of her own mother. Now she was surprised to find that
she too had been young, had loved, and had pleasures and heart-pains
of her own. This set her thinking. The process of thought was silent,
but its conclusion found outward expression; the girl understood now.
The secret of her life--the true secret was unveiled at last:

“Poor Aunt Judy. Oh, poor Aunt Judy!”

Athlyne’s letter reached him a day later, having been sent on from
London. It was a fairly bulky one, with a good many sheets of foreign
post, written hastily in a large bold hand.


“My Dear Friend:

I have been, and am, much concerned about you. I gather from his
letters that Colonel Ogilvie has been much disappointed at not having
heard from you. And I want, if you will allow me to take the liberty,
to speak to you seriously about it. You will give me this privilege I
know--if only for the fact that I am an old maid; for the same Powers
that made me an old maid have made me an old woman, and such is
entitled, I take it, to forbearance, if not to respect. You
should--you really should be more considerate towards Colonel Ogilvie.
He is an old man--much older than you perhaps think, for he bears
himself as proudly as in his younger days. But the claim on you is not
merely from his years; that claim must appeal to all. From you there
is one more imperative still, one which is personal and paramount: he
is under so very deep an obligation to you. A matter which from
another would pass unconsidered as an act of thoughtfulness must now,
when it is due to you, seem to him like a studied affront. I put it
this way because I know you are a man of noble nature, and that
generosity is to such even a stronger urge than duty--if such a thing
be possible. In certain matters he is sensitive beyond belief. Even to
a degree marked in a place where men still hold that their lives rest
behind every word and deed, every thought or neglect towards another.
I have some hesitation in mentioning this lest you should think I am
summoning Fear to the side of Duty. But you are above such a
misunderstanding, I am sure. Oh my dear friend do think of some of the
rest of us. You have saved the life of our darling Joy--the one
creature in whom all our loves are centred. Naturally we all want to
see you again--to make much of you--to show you in our own poor way
how deeply we hold you in our hearts. But if Colonel Ogilvie thinks
himself insulted--that is how he regards any neglect however
trivial--he acts on that belief, and there is no possible holding him
back. He looks on it as a sacred duty to avenge affront. You must not
blame him for it. In your peaceful English life you have I think no
parallel to the ungovernable waves of passion that rage in the hearts
of Kentuckians when they consider their honour is touched. Ah! we poor
women know it who have to suffer in silence and wait and wait, and
wait; and when the worst is made known to us, to seal up the founts of
our grief and pretend that we too agree with the avenging of wrong.
For it is our life to be silent in men’s quarrels. We are not given a
part--any part. We are not supposed to even look on. It is another
world from ours, and we have to accept it so. Please God may you never
know what it is to be in or on the fringe of a Feud. Well I know its
dread, its horror! My own life that years ago was as bright and
promising as any young life can be; when the Love that had dawned on
my girlhood rose and beat with noonday heat on my young-womanhood made
it seem as if heaven had come down to earth. And then the one moment
of misunderstanding--the quick accusation--the quicker retort--and my
poor heart lying crushed between the bodies of two men whom I loved
each in his proper way… Think of what I say, if only on account of
what I have suffered.

“Forgive me! But my anxiety lest any such blight should come across a
young life that I love far far beyond my own is heavy on me. I have
lost myself in sad thoughts of a bitter past… Indeed you must take
it that my earnestness in this matter is shown in the lurid light of
that past. I have been silent on it always. Never since the black
cloud burst over me have I said a word to a soul--not to my
sister--nor to Joy whom I adore and whose questioning to me of my
‘love affair’--as they still call it when they speak of it--is so
sweet a tightening bond between us. I have only said to her: ‘and then
he died,’ and my heart has seemed to stop beating. Be patient with me
and don’t blame me. You are a man and can be tolerant. Think not of me
or any gloom of my life but only that makes me sadly, grimly, terribly
in earnest when I see similar elements of tragedy drawing close to
each other before my eyes. You may be inclined to laugh at me--though
I know you will not--and to put down my thinking of possible great
quarrels arising from such small causes as ‘an old maid’s’ fears. But
when I have known the awful effect of a mere passing word,
misunderstood to such disastrous result, no wonder that I have fears.
It is due to that very cause that my fears are those of an old maid. I
suppose I need not ask you to be sure to keep all this locked in your
own breast. It is my secret; I have shared it with you because I deem
such necessary for the happiness of--of others. I have kept it so
close that not even those nearest and dearest to me have even
suspected it. The rowdiness of spirit--as it seems to me--which other
friends call fun and brightness and high spirits and other such
insulting terms--has been my domino as I have passed through the
hollow hearted carnival of life. Judge then how earnest I am when I
put it aside and raise my mask for you a stranger whom I have seen but
twice; I who even then was but an accessory--a super on the little
stage where we began to act our little--comedy or tragedy which is it
to be?

“There! I have opened to you my memory, not my heart. That you have no
use for. After such a letter as this I shall not pretend to go back to
the Proprieties, the _Convenances_. If I am right in my surmise--you
can guess what that is or why have you written to the old rowdy aunt
instead… there is every reason why I should be frank. But remember
that I hold--and have hitherto held--what I believe to be your secret
as sacredly as I hope you will hold mine. And if I am right--and from
my knowledge and insight won by past suffering I pray to God that I
am--you have no time to lose to make matters right, and possibly to
save the world one more sorrowful heart like my own. It is only a word
that is wanted--a morning call--a visit of ceremony. Anything that
will keep open the doors of friendship which you unlocked by your own
bravery. We are going in a day or two to Ambleside. In the meantime we
shall be in London at Brown’s Hotel Albemarle Street where my sister,
and incidentally myself, shall be glad to see you. …

“Won’t you let me have a line as soon as you can after you get this. I
am torn with anxiety till I know what you intend to do about visiting
Colonel Ogilvie. Again forgive me,

                                                 Your true friend,
                                                 Judy.

“P. S.--I shall not dare to read this over, lest when I had I should
not have courage to send it. Accept it then with all its faults and be
tolerant of them--and of me.”


Athlyne read the letter through without making a pause or even an
internal comment. That is how a letter should be read; to follow the
writer’s mind, not one’s own, and so take in the sequence of thoughts
and the general atmosphere as well as the individual facts. As he read
he felt deeply moved. There was in the letter that manifest sincerity
which showed that it was straight from the heart. And heart speaks to
heart, whatever may be the medium, if the purpose is sincere. It was a
surprise to him to learn that Miss Judy’s high and volatile spirits
rested on so sad a base. His appreciation of her worthiness came in
his unconscious resolution that when he and Joy were married Aunt Judy
should be an honoured guest in the house, and that they would try to
lighten, with what sympathy and kindness they could, the dark shadows
of her life.

He sat with the letter in his hand for some time. He was sitting in
the window of the hotel at Bowness looking out on the lake. It was
still early and the life of the day had hardly begun. At Bowness the
life was that of the tourists and visitors and it would still be an
hour or more before they began to move out on their objectives. He had
very many various and whirling thoughts, but supreme amongst them was
one: Time was flying. He must not delay, for every hour was more and
more jeopardising his chance of winning the woman he loved. He
realized to the full that his neglect of Colonel Ogilvie, for so it
was being construed, was making--had made--a difficulty for him. Each
day, perhaps each hour, was widening the breach; if he did not take
care he might end with the door permanently closed against him. As he
came to the conclusion of his reasoning he drew once more from his
pocket the sealed letter to Colonel Ogilvie, and stood up. He fancied
that his determination was made that he would see Colonel Ogilvie as
soon as possible and broach the subject to him. As however he went
towards the boat--for he was going to Ambleside by water--he postponed
the intention of an immediate interview. He would wait this one day
and see what would turn up. If nothing happened likely to further his
wishes he would whilst at Ambleside the next morning put the letter in
the post. Then he would hold himself ready for the interview with
Joy’s father for which the letter asked.

At Ambleside he took his place behind the lilacs in the garden and
kept watch on the window where Joy was wont to appear. A little before
breakfast-time she appeared there for a brief space, and then moved
back into the room. He waited with what patience he could till nearly
eleven o’clock when the same carriage which they used drove up to the
door; waiting became then an easier task. Presently Colonel Ogilvie
came out and stood on the steps. Athlyne wondered; this was the first
time that Joy had not been before him. Throwing his eyes around in
vague wondering as to the cause he saw Joy standing in the window
dressed and pulling on her gloves. She was radiantly beautiful. Her
colour was a little heightened and her lovely grey eyes shone like
stars. Her gaze was fixed so that her eyes seemed to look straight
before her but beyond him. The look made him quiver as though he felt
it were directed at him, and his knees began to tremble with a mighty,
vague longing. For quite a minute she stood there, till her eyes
falling she caught sight of her father standing by the carriage below.
She drew back quickly and almost immediately appeared at the
hall-door, saying:

“I am so sorry, Daddy. I hope I did not keep you waiting too long!”

“Not a bit little girl. It is a pleasure to me to wait for you; to do
anything for you, my dear. Whatever else is the use of being a
father.”

“You dear! May we go to-day up the mountain road where we can look
over the lake. I want you to have a nice glimpse of it again before
you go.”

Here Athlyne’s heart sank for an instant. This was the first idea he
had of any intention of moving, and it actually shook him. Joy had as
usual a handful of sugar for the horses. She went to the off side
horse first and gave him his share. Then when she stood at the head of
the other, her face toward the lilacs, she turned to her father and
said in a low, thrilling tone:

“Daddy, am I nice to-day? _Look at me!_” She stood still whilst the
old man looked at her admiringly, proudly, fondly.

“You are peerless, little girl. Peerless! that’s it!” She was
evidently pleased at the compliment, for her colour rose to a deep
flush. Her grey eyes shone through it like two great grey suns. Whilst
her father was speaking to the coachman she gave the other horse, now
impatient, his share of the sugar and stood looking across the road.
Athlyne could hardly contain himself. The few seconds, although flying
so fast, were momentous. Past and present rushed together to the
creation of a moment of ecstasy. The sound of the words swept him; the
idea and all it rewoke and intensified, transfigured his very soul.
And then he heard her say in a low, languorous voice which vibrated:

“Thank you Daddy for such a sweet compliment. I am glad I said ‘_Look
at me!_’” As she spoke it seemed to Athlyne that her eyes fixed across
the road sent their lightnings straight into his heart. And yet it did
not even occur to him at the moment that the words could have been
addressed to him.

During the drive Joy kept her father interested in all around them. He
saw that she was elated and happy, and it made his heart glad to that
receptive mood which is the recrudescence of youth. In the girl’s mind
to-day several trains of thought, all of them parental of action, went
on together. She did not analyze them; indeed she was hardly conscious
of them. The mechanism of mind was working to a set purpose, but one
which was temperamental rather than intentional--of sex and individual
character rather than of a studied conclusion. For that morning was to
her momentous. She knew it with all her instincts. Unconsciously she
drew conclusions from facts without waiting to develop their logical
sequence.

A telegram had arrived from Mrs. Ogilvie saying that she and Judy were
now ready to leave London and, as her husband had said that he wished
to escort them to Ambleside, they would be prepared on his coming to
leave on the next morning or whatever later time he might fix. After a
glance at the time-table he had wired back that he would go up on that
night, and that they would all start on the following morning. Joy had
offered to accompany him, but he would not have it: “No, little girl,”
he said. “Travel at night is all very well for men; but it takes it
out of women. I want your mother to see the bright, red-cheeked girl
that has been with me for the last week, and not a pale, worn-out
draggled young woman with her eyes heavy with weariness. You stay
here, my dear, and get plenty of air and sunshine. You will not be
afraid to be here alone with your maid!” Joy smiled:

“Not a bit, Daddy! I shall walk and drive all day and perhaps go down
the Lake in a boat. If I do the latter I shall take Eugenie with me
and we shall lunch down at Newby Bridge. We shall be home here in good
time to drive over and meet you all at the station at Windermere.”

From that moment Joy hardly left her father out of her sight.
Instinctively she knew that the chance of her life had come. She had a
conviction--it was more than a mere idea or even a belief--that if she
were alone whilst her father was up in London or on the way down, that
figure which even now was hidden by the lilacs would abandon secretive
ways and come out into the open where she could see him close, and
hear the sound of his voice--that voice whose every note made music in
her ears. It was the presence of her father which kept him hidden. It
was imperative, both in accordance with his wishes as well as from her
own apprehensions of what might happen if they should meet
unexpectedly before she had time to warn him, that no mischance should
prevent an early meeting, free from any suspicion between herself and
Mr. Hardy. When Daddy was well on his way. … Here she would close
her eyes; definite thought was lost in a languorous ecstasy. The
coming day would mean to her everything or. …

The drive was a fairly long one and they did not get back till nearly
one o’clock. Colonel Ogilvie had said to Joy:

“I shall have a good time to-day, have plenty of fresh air and be
ready for sleep when I get into the train. As I shall arrive early in
the morning I shall have time to express my opinions on their conduct
to those automobile people. They won’t expect my coming and be able to
get out of the way. I fancy it will do me good to say what I feel; or
at any rate enough to give them some indication of what I could say,
and shall say if there is any further delay in the matter.”

When they arrived Joy went at once into the hotel leaving her father
to tell the coachman at what hour to be ready for the afternoon drive.
She went straight to the window and, keeping as usual behind the
curtain, looked over at the lilac bushes. She could see through the
foliage that there was _some one_ there, and that satisfied her. She
would have liked to have instructed the driver herself so that she
would have been sure that he knew; but on this occasion a wave of
diffidence suddenly overwhelmed her. Times were coming when she would
not be able to afford the luxury of such an emotion, so she grasped it
whilst she could.

Colonel Ogilvie was to catch the train from Windermere at nine
o’clock, so the second drive should come after lunch and not after
tea; and when she was in her own room, Joy feared that He might miss
them. When, however, before going downstairs she looked out of the
window she saw that he was still at his post. Athlyne’s campaigning
experience had had its own psychology. Seeing that there was some
change in the Ogilvie day he had arranged his own plans to meet it.
Whilst they had been taking their morning drive he had provided
himself with some sandwiches; he had determined not to leave his post
until he knew more. Joy’s words had all day rung in his ears, and he
was now and again distracted with doubts. Was it possible that there
had been any meaning or intention in her words more than was apparent?
Was the spontaneity consequent on some deep feeling which evoked
memory? Could he believe that she really. … He would wait now before
sending the letter, whatever came. In that he was adamant.

During the drive Joy was mainly silent. It was not the silence of
thought; it was simply spiritual quiescence. She knew that the rest of
the day was so laid out that it was unlikely it could be marred by an
untoward accident. There was this in His persistent waiting that she
had come to trust it. There was some intention, so manifest, though
what it was was unknown to her, that it was hardly to be disturbed by
any sudden exigency. She lived at the moment in a world of calm, a
dream-world of infinite happiness. Now and again she woke to the
presence of her father and then poured on him in every way in which a
young woman can all the treasures of her thought and affection. This
made the old man so happy that he too was content to remain silent
when she ceased to speak.

When they got back to the hotel, she spoke to the driver:

“You will be here at eight o’clock please, as you will have to drive
Colonel Ogilvie to the station at Windermere in good time to catch the
nine o’clock train. I shall not want you in the morning as I intend to
take a walk; but you must be at Windermere to meet my father at five
o’clock. If to-morrow afternoon there is any change in his plans he
will wire the hotel people and they will let you know. Perhaps you had
better call here on your way to Windermere as I may go over in the
carriage. But if I am not here do not wait for me; I may possibly walk
over. When you have left Colonel Ogilvie at Windermere to-night you
will have to leave me back here. I am going to the depot with him.”

Then she went into the doorway, and hurried to the sitting-room where
she looked out into the garden--where the lilacs grew.




 CHAPTER XIII.
 INSTINCTIVE PLANNING

Man’s unconscious action is a strange thing. Athlyne had just heard
words which took from him a strain under which he had suffered for a
whole week of waiting and watching; words which promised him the
opportunity for which he had longed for many weeks. His nerves had
been strung to tension so high that now it would seem only natural if
the relief sent him into a sort of delirium. But he quietly lit a
cigar, taking care that it was properly cut and properly lit, and
smoked luxuriously as he moved across the garden and into the street.
Joy from her window saw him go, and her admiration of his ease and
self possession and magnificent self-reliance sent fresh thrills
through her flesh.

When Athlyne went out of the garden he had evidently made up his mind,
consciously or unconsciously, to some other point in connection with
the motor for he visited such shops as were open and made some
purchases--caps, veils, cloaks and such like gear suitable for the use
of a tall young lady. These he took with him in a hired carriage to
the hotel at Bowness, where he added them to certain others already
sent from London. Then he told the chauffeur to give the car a careful
overhauling so that it be in perfect order, and went for a stroll up
the Lake.

Shortly he was in a mental and physical tumult; the period which had
elapsed since he heard the news of Colonel Ogilvie’s coming departure
had been but the prelude to the storm. At first he could not think; he
had no words, no sequence of ideas, not even vague intentions. He had
only sensations; and these though they moved and concentrated every
nerve in his body were without even physical purpose. He went like one
in a dream. But in the background of his mind was a fact which stood
out firm and solid like the profile of a mountain seen against the
glow of a western sunset. Joy would be alone to-morrow; the
opportunity he waited for was at last at hand! The recognition of this
seemed to pull him together, to set all his faculties working
simultaneously; and as each had a different method the tumult was in
reducing them to unison--in achieving one resultant from all the
varying forces. Gradually out of the chaos came the first clear
intent: he must so master the whole subject that when the opportunity
had come he should be able to avail himself of it to the full. From
this he proceeded to weigh the various possibilities, till gradually
he began to realise what vague purpose had been behind his wish to
have his automobile in perfect working order. It did not even occur to
him that with such machinery at his command he might try to carry her
off, either without her consent or with it. All that he wanted in the
first instance was to have fitting opportunity of discovering how Joy
regarded him. The last twenty-four hours had opened to his mind such
glorious possibilities that every word she had said, every look on her
eloquent face (though such looks had manifestly not been intended for
him) had a place in a chain which linked her heart to his. “Look at
me!” “I am glad I asked you to look at me!” though spoken to her
father seemed to have another significance. It was as though an eager
thought had at last found expression. “Good night! Good night,
beloved!” though ostensibly spoken to the twilight was breathed with
such fervour, with such languishing eyes and with such soft pouting of
scarlet lips that it seemed impossible that it should have other than
a human objective. These thoughts swept the man into a glow of
passion. He was young and strong and ardent, and he loved the woman
with all his heart; with all his soul; with all the strength of human
passion. It is a mistake to suppose--as some abstract thinkers seem to
do always, and most people at some moment of purely spiritual
exaltation--that the love of a man and a woman each for the other is,
even at its very highest, devoid of physical emotion. The original
Creator did not manifestly so intend. The world of thought is an
abstract world whose inner shrine is where soul meets soul. The world
of life is the world of the heart, and its beating is the sway of the
pendulum between soul and flesh. The world of flesh is the real world;
wrought of physical atoms in whose recurrent groupings is the
elaborated scheme of nature. Into this world has been placed Man to
live and rule. To this end his body is fixed with various powers and
complications and endurances; with weaknesses and impulses and
yieldings; with passions to animate, with desires to attract, and
animosities to repel. And as the final crowning of this wondrous work,
the last and final touch of the Creator’s hand, Sex for the eternal
renewing of established forces. How can souls be drawn to souls when
such are centred in bodies which mutually repel? How can the heart
quicken its beats when it may not come near enough to hear the
answering throb? No! If physical attraction be not somewhere, naught
can develop. Judy, the outspoken, had once almost horrified a little
group of matrons who were discussing the interest which a certain
young cleric was beginning to take in one of the young female
parishioners. When one of them said, somewhat sanctimoniously, that
his interest was only in the salvation of her immortal soul, that he
was too good a man to ever think of falling in love as ordinary men
do, the vivacious old maid replied:

“Not a bit of it, my dear! When a man troubles himself about an
individual young woman’s soul you may be quite certain that his eyes
have not neglected her body. And moreover you will generally, if not
always, find that she has a pair of curving red lips, or a fine bust,
or a well-developed figure somewhere!”

Athlyne loved Joy in all ways, so that the best of his nature
regulated the standard of his thoughts. His love was no passing fancy
which might or might not develop, flame up, and fade away. He had, he
felt, found the other half of him, lost in the primeval chaos; and he
wanted the union to be so complete that it would outlive the clashing
of worlds in the final cataclysm. Healthy people are healthy in their
loves and even in their passions. These two young people were both
healthy, both red-blooded, both of ardent, passionate nature; and they
were drawn together each to each by all the powers that rule sex and
character. To say that their love was all of earth would be as absurd
as to say that it was all of heaven. It was human, all human, and all
that such implies. Heaven and earth had both their parts in the
combination; and perhaps, since both were of strong nature and marked
individuality, Hell had its due share in the amalgam.

Athlyne thought, and thought, and thought; till the length of his own
shadow recalled the passing of time. He postponed the thinking over
his plans for to-morrow--the active part of them, and hastened back to
his place behind the lilacs.

He was just in time. The carriage stood at the door with Colonel
Ogilvie’s “grip-sack” at the driver’s feet. Then the Boots ran down
the steps and held the carriage door open. Joy came holding her
father’s arm. They got into the carriage and drove away. Athlyne
waited, sitting on the seat on the grass lawn smoking luxuriously. He
forgot that he was hungry and thirsty, forgot everything except that
he would before long see Joy again, this time _alone_. His thoughts
were evidently pleasant, for the time flew fast. Indeed he must have
been in something like a waking dream which absorbed all his faculties
for he did not notice the flight of time at all. It was only when,
recalled to himself by the passing of a carriage, he looked up and saw
Joy that he came back to reality. To his disappointment her head was
turned away. When within sight of the garden, she had noticed him and
as she did not wish him, just yet, to know that she knew of his
presence, she found her eyes fixed on the other side of the street. It
was the easiest and most certain way of avoiding complexities. He
slipped over to the lilacs to see her alight. When she had done so she
turned to the coachman and said:

“You understand I shall not want you in the morning as I shall be out
walking; but if I don’t send for you in the afternoon, or if you don’t
get any message you will meet my father at Windermere station at a
quarter to five.”

She went to the front of the carriage and stroked the horses’ noses
and necks after her usual fashion. He had as good a view of her
profile as the twilight would allow. Then with a pleasant “Good
evening!” to the coachman she tripped up the steps and disappeared.
For more than a quarter of an hour Athlyne watched the windows; but
she did not appear. This was natural enough, for she was behind the
curtains peeping out to see if he went back to his seat on the lawn.

When she saw that he did not return Joy, with a gentle sigh, went to
her room.

That sigh meant a lot. It was the reaction from an inward struggle.
All day she had been suffering from the dominance of two opposing
ideas, between which her inward nature swayed pendulum-wise. This
“inward nature” comprised her mind, her reason, her intelligence, her
fears, her hopes, her desires--the whole mechanism and paraphernalia
of her emotional and speculative psychology. She would fain have gone
out boldly into the garden and there met Mr. Hardy face to face--of
course by pure accident. But this vague intention was combated by a
maiden fear; one of those delicious, conscious apprehensions made to
be combated unless thoroughly supported by collateral forces; one of
those gentle fears of sex which makes yielding so sweet. Following
this came the fixed intention of that walk to be taken in the morning.
The morning was still far off and its apprehensive possibilities were
not very dreadful. Indeed she did not really fear them at all for she
had privately made up her mind that, fear or no fear, she was going on
that walk. The only point left open was its direction. The hour was
positively settled; an hour earlier than that at which for the past
few days she had driven out with Daddy! Even to herself she would not
admit that her choice of time was in any way controlled or influenced
by the fact that it was the same hour about which Mr. Hardy made his
appearance in the garden.

But all the same her thoughts and her intentions were becoming
conscious. For good or evil she was getting more reckless in her
desires; passion was becoming dominant--and she knew it.

This is perhaps the most dangerous phase of a woman’s trial. She knows
that there is at work a growing desire for self-surrender which it is
her duty to combat. She knows that all contra reasons which can be
produced will be--must be--overcome. She knows with all the subtle
instincts of her sex that she is deliberately setting her feet on a
slope down which some impulse, perhaps but momentary, will carry her
with resistless force. It is the preparatory struggle to defeat; the
clearing away of difficulties which might later be hampering or even
obstructive; the clamant _wish_ for defeat which makes for the
conquered the satisfaction if not the happiness of finality. To all
children of Adam, of either sex, this phase may come. To the strongest
and most resolute warrior must be a moment when he can no more; when
the last blow has been struck and the calling of another world is
ringing in his ears; to the resolute amongst men this moment is the
moment of death. To women it is surrender of self; surrender to the
embrace of Death--or to the embrace of Love. It is the true end of the
battle. The rest is but the carrying out of the Treaty of Peace, the
Triumph of the Victory in which she is now proud to have a part--if it
be only that of captive!

There was no sleep for Joy that night. She heard the hours strike one
after the other, never missing one. She was not restless. She lay
still, and quiet, and calm; patient with that patience which is an
acceptance that what is to come is good. In all the long vigil she
never faltered in her intention to take that walk in the forenoon.
What was to happen in it she did not guess. She had a conviction that
that tall figure would follow her discreetly; and that when she was
alone they would somehow meet. It might be that she would hear his
voice before she saw him; that was most likely, indeed almost certain,
for she would not turn till he had spoken … or at any rate till she
knew that he was close behind her. … Here her thoughts would stop.
She would lie in a sort of ecstasy … whatever might come after that
would be happiness. She would see Him … look into His eyes. …
“Look at me, Joy!” seemed to sound in her ears in sweet low music like
a whisper. Then she would close her eyes and lie motionless, passive,
breathing as gently as a child; high-strung, conscious, awake and
devoid of any definite intent.

When she was dressing for the day she put on one of the simplest and
prettiest of her dresses, one which she had directed over night to be
got ready; a sort of heavy gauze of dull white which fell in long full
folds showing her tall slim figure to its perfect grace. Her maid who
was a somewhat silent person, not given to volubility unless
encouraged, looked at her admiringly as she said:

“I do think miss that is the most becoming of all your frocks!” This
pleased her and sent a red glow through her cheeks. Then, fearing if
she seemed to think too much of the matter it might seem suspicious as
to some purpose, she said quietly:

“Perhaps then it would be better if I put on one of the lawn dresses.
I am going for a walk this morning and as it may be dusty a frock that
will not catch the dust may be better.”

“It does seem a pity miss to wear such a pretty frock and spoil it
when there is no one here to see it; not even your father.” This gave
Joy an opening of which she quickly availed herself. She had not the
least intention of changing the frock or of looking, if she could
avoid it, one whit below her best.

“Fie, Eugenie! one doesn’t put on frocks to attract. If you think that
way, I shall wear it; even if it is to get dusty.” The Abigail who was
a privileged person answered gravely:

“That’s quite true, Miss, exactly as you say it. _One_ doesn’t put on
nice frocks to attract; and that one is yourself. But all the rest
do!” Joy’s merry laugh showed the measure of her ebullient happiness.

“Dear me! Eugenie. You are quite an orthoëpist--indeed a
precisionist. I shall have to polish up my grammar. However I’ll keep
on the frock if only in compliment to your sense of terminological
exactitude!”

A little after breakfast, when the time for starting on the walk drew
nigh, Joy did not feel so elated. Woman-like she was not anxious to
begin. It was not that she in any way faltered in her purpose, but
merely that she was suffering from the nervousness which comes to
those of high strung temperaments in momentous crises. Humming merrily
she put on her hat and finished her toilet for her walk. In the
sitting room from the shelter of the curtain she looked out of the
window, as she tried to think, casually. Her eyes turned towards the
lilac bushes, but caught no indication of the tall figure that she
sought. Her heart fell. But a second later it leaped almost painfully
as she saw Mr. Hardy sitting out openly on the seat, and strange to
say--for she had come to identify that seat with the practice--not
smoking. He evidently had no present thought of being concealed. Why?
The answer to her own question came in a rush of blood to her face, a
rush so quick and thorough that it seemed for the moment to deplete
her heart which beat but faintly… When she looked again he had risen
and was moving toward the lilacs.

Without a word she walked downstairs and out through the hall-door.


Athlyne had not slept either that night. But the manner and range of
his thoughts showed the difference between the sexes. Both his
imagining and his reasoning were to practical purpose. He wanted to
see Joy, to speak with her, to prove to himself if his hoping was in
any way justified by fact. He had for so long been concentrating his
thoughts on one subject that doubts at first shadowy had become real.
It seemed therefore to him that in his planning for the morrow he was
dealing with real things, not imaginative ones. And, after all, there
is nothing more real than doubt--so far as it goes. Victor Cousin took
from its reality his subtlest argument for belief: “At this point
scepticism itself vanishes; for if a man doubt everything else, at
least he cannot doubt that he doubts.” So with Athlyne. By accepting
doubt as reality he began the experiment for its cure.

In the silence of the night, with nerves high-strung and with brain
excited he tried in those most earnest hours of his life, when for
good or ill he was to organise his intellectual forces, to arrange
matters so that at the earliest time he might with certainty learn his
fate. He had an idea that in such a meeting as was before him he must
not be over-precipitated. And yet he must not check impulsiveness as
long as its trend was in the right direction. He knew that a woman’s
heart is oftener won by assault than by siege. For himself he had
plenty of patience as well as a sufficiency of spirit; his task at
present therefore was one of generalship alone: the laying out of the
battle plans, the disposition of his forces. As he thought, and as his
ideas and his intentions came into order, he began to understand
better the purpose of those two preparations of his which were already
complete: the overhauling of his automobile, and the supplying it with
female wraps. He intended by some means or other, dependent on
developing opportunity, to bring her for a ride in the motor. There,
all alone, he would be able to learn, perhaps at first from her
bearing and then from her own lips, how she regarded him.

Athlyne was a young man, a very young man in his real knowledge of the
sex. There are hundreds, thousands, of half-pulseless boys, flabby of
flesh and pallid with enervating dissipation, who would have smiled
cynically--they have not left in them grit enough for laughter--at his
doubting.

He would not frighten her at first. Here for a time he took himself to
task for seeming to plot against the woman he loved. Surely it would
be better to treat her with perfect fairness; to lay his heart at her
feet; tell her with all the passionate force that swept him how he
loved her--tell it with what utterance he had. Then he should wait her
decision. No, not decision! That was too cold a word--thought. If
indeed there was any answering love to his, little decision would be
required. Had _he_ made any decision! From the first moment he had
looked in her beautiful grey eyes and lost himself in their depths,
his very soul had gone out to her. And it might be that she too had
felt something of the same self-abandonment. He could never forget how
on that afternoon visit at the Holland she had raised her eyes to his
in answer to his passionate appeal: “Joy, Look at me!” Then at that
memory, and at the later memory when she had spoken the words herself
only the day before--the sweetness of her voice was still tingling in
his ears, a sort of tidal wave of lover’s rapture swept over him. It
overwhelmed him so completely that it left him physically gasping for
breath. He was in a tumult; he could not lie in bed. He leaped to his
feet and walked to and fro with long, passionate strides. He threw up
the lower sash of the window and looked out into the moonlight,
craning his neck round to the right so that his eyes were in the
direction of Ambleside as though the very ardour of his gaze could
pierce through distance and stone walls and compel Joy’s white eyelids
to raise so that he might once more lose himself in those grey deeps
wherein his soul alone found peace.

In this passion of adoration all his doubts seemed to disappear, as
the sun drinks up the mist. He felt as though uplifted. At the very
idea of Joy’s loving him as he loved her he felt more worthy, more
strong, and with a sense of triumph which had no parallel in his life.
He stood looking out at the beauty of the scene before him, till
gradually it became merged in his thoughts with Joy and his hopes
which the morrow might realise. He never knew exactly how long he
stood there. It must have been a long time, for when he realised any
sense of time at all he was cramped and chill; and the forerunner of
the morning light coming from far away behind him was articulating the
fields on the hill-slopes across the lake.

He was then calm. All the thinking and reasoning and planning and
passion of the night had been wrought into unity. His mind was made up
as to the first stage of his undertaking. He would bring the car to
Ambleside and leave it with the chauffeur outside the town. Then he
would take his place in the garden and wait till she came out for that
walk of which she had told her father. He would cautiously follow her;
and when there was a fair opportunity for uninterrupted speech would
come to her. If he found there was no change in her manner to him--and
here once again the memory of those lifting eyes made him tremble--he
would try to get her to come for a ride in his car. There, wrapped in
the glory of motion and surrounded by all the grandeur of natural
beauty, he would pour out his soul to her and put his fate to the
touch. Then if all were well he would send on the letter to her father
and would pay his formal visit as soon as might be. He would take care
to have ready a luncheon basket so that if she would ride with him
they might have together an ethereal banquet.

It is strange that even those who are habitually cautious, whose
thoughts and deeds alike are compelled and ruled by reason, will in
times of exaltation forget their guiding principle. They will refuse
to acknowledge the existence of chance; and will proceed calmly on
their way as though life was as a simple cord, with Inclination
pulling at one end of it and Fact yielding at the other.




 CHAPTER XIV.
 A BANQUET ON OLYMPUS

On this occasion Athlyne did not continue to sit out on the lawn.
Now that he wished to overtake Joy unawares he was as careful to hide
his presence from her as he had previously hidden it from her father.
He had hardly ensconced himself in his usual cover when Joy came out
on the steps. Her maid was with her and together they stood on the
steps speaking. As she turned to come down the steps Joy said:

“Perhaps I had better arrange to come back after a short walk; there
might be some telegram from father to be attended to. If there is not,
I can then go for a real, long walk.” She did not say more but moved
briskly down the roadway without ever turning her head. Athlyne
slipped through the gate of the garden, following at such distance
that he could easily keep out of view in case she should turn. When
she had cleared the straggling houses which made the outskirts of the
little town she walked slowly, and then more slowly still. Finally she
sat on a low wall by the roadside with her back partially turned to
Ambleside and looked long at the beautiful view before her where,
between the patches of trees which here shut out the houses altogether
and heightened the air of privacy of the bye road, the mountain slopes
rose before her.

This was the opportunity for which Athlyne was waiting. He had hardly
dared to hope that it would be in a spot so well adapted to his
wishes. Dear simple soul! he never imagined that it had been already
chosen--marked down by a keener intellect than his own, and that
intellect a woman’s!

Joy knew that he was coming; that he was drawing closer; that he was
at hand. It was not needed that she had now and again thrown a half
glance behind her at favourable moments as she went. There was at work
a subtler sense than any dealing with mere optics; a sense that can
float on ether waves as surely as can any other potent force. Nay, may
it not be the same sense specialised. The sense that makes soul known
to soul, sex to sex; that tells of the presence of danger; that calls
kind to kind, and race to race, from the highest of creation to the
lowest. And so she was prepared and waited, calm after the manner of
her sex. For when woman waits for the coming of man her whole being is
in suspense. Though in secret her heart beat painfully Joy did not
look round, made no movement till the spoken words reached her:

“Miss Ogilvie is it not!”

Slowly she turned, as to a voice but partly heard or partly
remembered. Athlyne felt his heart sink down, down as he saw the
slowness of the movement and realised the absence of that quick
response which he had by long and continuous thinking since last night
encouraged himself to expect. The quick gleam of pleasure in the face
as she turned, the light in her marvellous grey eyes, the gentle blush
which despite herself passed like an Alpenglow from forehead to neck
did not altogether restore his equanimity or even encourage him
sufficiently to try to regain that pinnacle of complacent hope on
which up to then he had stood.

“Why Mr. Hardy,” she said warmly as she rose quickly to her feet.
“This is real nice. I was afraid we were not going to see you whilst
we were in England.”

It was beautifully done; no wonder that some women can on the stage
carry a whole audience with them, when off it so many can deceive
intellects more powerful than their own. And yet it was not all
acting. She did not intend it as such; not for a moment did she wish
or intend to deceive. It was only the habit of obedience to convention
which was guiding natural impulse into safe channels. For who shall
say where nature--the raw, primeval crude article--ends or where
convention, which is the artfulness necessitated by the elaboration of
organised society, begins. A man well known in New York used to say:
“All men are equal after the fish!” Kipling put the same idea in
another way: … “the Colonel’s Lady an’ Judy O’Grady are sisters
under their skins!”

When Athlyne looked into Joy’s eyes--and there was full opportunity
for so doing--all his intentions of reserve went from him. He was
lover all over; nothing but lover, with wild desire to be one with her
he loved. His eyes began to glow, his knees to tremble, then every
muscle of his body became braced; and when he spoke his voice at once
deepened and had a masterful ring which seemed to draw Joy’s very soul
out towards him. Well it was for her main purpose that her instinct
had given that first chill of self-possession; had the man been able
to go on from where he had first started nothing that she knew of
reserve or self-restraint could have prevented her from throwing
herself straightway into his arms. Had Athlyne not begun with that
same chill, which to him took the measure of a repulse, he would have
caught her to him with all the passions of many kinds which were
beginning to surge in him.

But what neither of them could effect alone, together they did. The
pause of the fraction of a second in the springing of their passion
made further restraint possible. There is no fly-wheel in the
mechanism of humanity to carry the movement of the crank beyond its
level. Such machinery was not invented at the time of the organisation
of Eden.

“I have longed for this moment more than I can say; more than words
can tell!” His voice vibrated with the very intensity of his truth.
Joy’s eyes, despite her efforts to keep them fixed, fell. Her bosom
rose and fell quickly and heavily with the stress of her breathing.
Her knees trembled and a slow pallor took the place of the flush on
her face. Seemingly unconsciously she murmured so faintly that only a
lover’s ear could hear or follow it:

“I have longed for it too--oh so much!” The words dropped from her
lips like faint music. Instinctively she put her hand on the wall
beside her to steady herself; she feared she was going to faint.

Athlyne, seeing and hearing, thrilled through to the very marrow of
his bones. His great love controlled, compelled him. He made no
movement towards her but looked with eyes of rapture. Such a moment
was beyond personal satisfaction; it was of the gods, not of men. And
so they stood.

Then the tears welled over in Joy’s eyes beneath the fallen lids. They
hung on the dark, curly lashes and rolled like silver beads down the
softness of her cheeks. Still Athlyne made no sign; he felt that the
time had not yet come. The woman was his own now, he felt
instinctively; and it was his duty--his sacred privilege to protect
her. Unthinkingly he moved a step back on the road he had come.
Instinctively Joy did the same. It was without thought or intention on
the part of either; all instinctive, all natural. The usage of the
primeval squaw to follow her master outlives races.

Then he paused. She came up to him and they walked level. Not another
word had been spoken; but there are silences that speak more than can
be written in ponderous tomes. These two--this man and this
woman--_knew_. They had in their hearts in those glorious moments all
the wisdom won by joy and suffering through all the countless ages
since the Lord rested on that first Sabbath eve and felt that His
finished work was good.

When, keeping even step, they had taken a few quiet paces, Athlyne
spoke in a soft whisper that thrilled:

“Joy, look at me!”

Without question or doubt of any kind she raised her shining eyes to
his. And then, slowly and together as though in obedience to some
divine command, their lips met in a long, loving kiss in which their
very souls went out each to the other.

When their mouths parted, with a mutual sigh, each gave a quick glance
up and down the road; neither had thought of it before.

The tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil did not die in Eden bower.
It flourishes still in even the most unlikely places all the wide
world over. And they who taste its fruit must look with newly-opened
eyes on the world around them.

Together, still keeping step, not holding each other, not touching
except by the chance of movement, they walked to where the bye-road
joined the main one. As yet they had spoken between them less than
threescore words. They wondered later in the day when they talked
together how so much as they had thought and felt and conveyed had
been packed into such compass. Now, as they paused at the joining of
the roads, Athlyne said--and strange to say it was in an ordinary
commonplace voice:

“Joy won’t you come with me for a ride. I have my motor here, and we
can go alone. There is much I want to say to you--much to tell you,
and the speed will help us. I want to rush along--to fly. Earth is too
prosaic for me--now!” Joy looking softly up caught the lightning that
flashed from his eyes, and her own fell. A tide of red swept her face;
this passed in a moment, however, leaving a divine pink like summer
sunset on snowy heights. Her voice was low and thrilling as she
answered with eyes still cast down.

“I’ll go with you where you will--to the end of the world--or Heaven
or Hell if you wish--now!”

And then as if compelled by a force beyond control she raised her eyes
to his.

“Shall you come with me to the car; or shall I bring it to the hotel?”
He spoke once more in something like his ordinary voice.

“Neither!” she answered with her eyes still fixed on his
unflinchingly. He felt their witchery run through him like fire now;
his blood seemed to boil as it rushed through his veins. Love and
passion were awake and at one.

“I must go back to see if there is any wire from Daddy, and to leave
word that I am going for a drive. I shall tell my maid that I shall
return in good time. Father and Mother and Aunt Judy are to arrive at
Windermere at five o’clock unless we hear to the contrary. You bring
up the motor to--to there where we met.” Her eyes burned through him
as without taking them from his she raised an arm and pointed
gracefully up the bye-road, towards where they had sat.

“Don’t come with me,” she said as he moved with her. “It will be
sweeter to keep our secret to ourselves.”

And so, he raising his cap as he stood aside, she passed on after
sending one flashing look of love right through him.

At the hotel she found a wire from her father to the effect that they
would not be able to leave Euston at 11.30 as intended but that they
hoped to reach Windermere at 7.05. This pleased her, for it gave her
another two hours for that motor drive to which she looked forward
with beating heart. She told her maid that she would be out till late
in the afternoon as she was going motoring with a friend; and that
she, Eugenie, could please herself as to how she would pass the time.
When the maid asked her what she wished as to lunch she answered:

“I shall not want any lunch; but if we feel hungry we can easily get
some on the way.”

“Which way shall you be going, Miss, in case any one should ask.”

“I really don’t know Eugenie. I just said I would join in the drive. I
daresay it is up somewhere amongst the lakes. That is where the fine
scenery is.”

“And what about wraps, miss? You will want something warm for
motoring. That dress you have on is rather thin for the purpose.”

“Oh dear; oh dear!” she answered with chagrin. “This will do well
enough, I think. We shall not, I expect, be going very far. If I find
I want a wrap I can borrow one.” And off she set for the rendezvous.

In the meantime Athlyne had found the car, and had given instructions
to the chauffeur to remain at an inn at Ambleside which he had already
noted for the purpose and where a telegram would find him in case it
might be necessary to give any instructions. He had made sure that the
luncheon basket which he had ordered at Bowness was in its place. Then
he had driven back to the bye-road and waited with what patience he
could for the coming of Joy.

She came up the bye-road walking fast enough. Up to that point she had
walked leisurely, but when she saw the great car all flaming
magnificently in scarlet and gold she forgot everything in the way of
demureness, and hurried forward. She had also seen Mr. Hardy. That
morning he had put on his motor clothes, for he knew he had to look
forward to a long spell of hard work before him--work of a kind which
needs special equipment. More than ever did he look tall and lithe and
elegant in his well-fitting suit of soft dark leather. When he caught
sight of Joy and saw that she was still in her pretty white frock he
began to lift from the bottom of the tonneau a pile of wraps which he
spread on the side. Joy did not notice the things at first; her eyes
were all for him. He stepped forward to meet her and, after a quick
glance round to see that they were alone, took her in his arms and
kissed her. She received the kiss in the most natural way--as if it
was a matter of course, and returned it. It is surprising what an easy
art to learn kissing is, and how soon even the most bashful of lovers
become reconciled to its exacting rules!

Then she began to admire his car, partly to please him, partly because
it was really a splendid machine admirably wrought to its special
purpose--speed. He lifted a couple of coats and asked:

“Which will you wear?”

“Must I wear one? It is warm enough isn’t it without a coat?”

“At present, yes! But when our friend here” he slapped the car
affectionately “wakes up and knows who he has the honour of carrying
you’ll want it. You have no idea what a difference a fifty or sixty
mile breeze makes.”

“I’ll take this one, please,” she said without another word; a ready
acquiescence to his advice which made him glow afresh. One after
another she took all the articles which his loving forethought had
provided, and put them on prettily. She felt, and he felt too, that
each fresh adornment was something after the manner of an embrace. At
the last he lifted the motor cap and held it out to her. She took it
with a smile and a blush.

“I really quite forgot my hat,” she said. “’Tis funny how your memory
goes when you’re very eager!” This little speech, unconsciously
uttered, sent a wave of sweet passion through the man. “Very Eager!”
She went on:

“But where on earth am I to put it? I think I had almost better hide
it here behind the hedge and retrieve it when we get back!” Athlyne
smiled superiorly--that sort of affectionate tolerant superiority
which a woman admires in a man she loves and which the least
sentimental man employs unconsciously at times. He stooped into the
tonneau and from under one of the seats drew out a leather bonnet-box
which ran in and out on a slide. As he touched a spring this flew
open, showing space and equipment for several hats and a tiny dressing
bag.

“Why, dear, there is everything in the world in your wonderful car.”

How he was thrilled by her using the word--the first time her lips had
used it to him. It was none the less sweet because spoken without
thought. She herself had something of the same feeling. She quivered
in a languorous ecstasy. But she did not even blush at the thought; it
had been but the natural expression of her feeling and she was glad
she had said it. Their eyes searched each other and told their own
eloquent tale.

“Darling!” he said, and bending over kissed again the rosy mouth that
was pouted to meet him.

In silence he opened the door of the tonneau. She drew back.

“Must I go in there--alone?”

“I can’t go with you, darling. I must sit in the seat to drive. Unless
you would rather we had the chauffeur!”

“You stupid old … _dear_!” this in a whisper. “I want to sit beside
you--as close as I can … _darling_!” She sank readily into the arms
which instinctively opened.

True love makes its own laws, its own etiquettes. When lovers judge
harshly each the conduct of the other it is time for the interference
or the verdict of strangers. But not till then.

Athlyne took the wheel, feeling in a sort of triumphant glory; in
every way other than he had expected. He thought that he would be
ardent and demonstrative; he was protective. The very trustfulness of
her reception of his caresses and her responsiveness to them made for
a certain intellectual quietude.

Joy too was in a sort of ecstatic calm. There was such completeness
about her happiness that all thought of self disappeared. She did not
want anything to be changed in the whole universe. She did not want
time to fly betwixt now and her union with the man she loved. That
might--would--come later; but in the meanwhile happiness was so
complete as to transcend ambition, hope, time.

Athlyne, who had made up his mind as to the direction of the drive,
came down on the high road and drove at moderate speed to Ambleside;
he thought that it would be wise to go slowly so as not to be too
conspicuous. He had given Joy a dust-veil but she had not yet adjusted
it. The present pace did not require such protection, and the idea of
concealing her identity did not even enter into her head. When they
were passing the post-office a sudden recollection came to Athlyne,
and he stopped the car suddenly. Joy for an instant was a little
alarmed and looked towards him inquiringly.

“Only a letter which I want to post!” he said in reply as he stepped
down on the pavement. He opened his jacket and took from his pocket a
letter which he placed in the box. Joy surmised afresh about the
letter; she vaguely wondered if it was the same that she had seen him
close and put into his pocketbook. The thought was, however, only a
passing one. She had something else than other people’s letters to
think about at present.

Just as he was turning back from the post box Eugenie, who was taking
advantage of her freedom, passed along the pavement. She stopped to
admire the tall chauffeur whom she thought the handsomest man she had
ever seen. She did not know him. Her service with Miss Ogilvie had
only commenced with the visit to London: up to the time of her leaving
Italy Mrs. Ogilvie’s maid had attended to Joy. She stood back and
pretended to be looking in at a window as she did not care to be seen
staring openly at him. Then she saw that he was no ordinary chauffeur.
It was with a sigh that she said to herself:

“_Voila! Un vrai Monsieur!_” Her eyes following him as he turned the
starting handle and took his seat behind the wheel, she saw that his
companion was her mistress. Not wishing to appear as if prying on her
either, she instinctively turned away.

As Athlyne was arranging himself to his driving work he said quietly
to Joy:

“Sorry for delaying, but it was a most important letter, which I want
to be delivered to-night. It might be late if it was not posted till
Carlisle.” This was the first knowledge Joy had of the direction of
the journey. Eugenie heard only the last word as the car moved off.

The pace was comparatively slow until the outskirts of Ambleside had
been passed; then he told Joy to put on her spectacles and donned his
own. When they were both ready he increased the pace, and they flew up
to the shores of Rydal Water. At Joy’s request they slowed down whilst
the lake was in sight; but raced again till the road ran close to the
peaceful water of Grasmere. But when Grasmere with its old church and
Coleridge’s tomb lay away to their left they flew again up the steep
road to Thirlmere. Athlyne was a careful driver and the car was a good
hill climber. It was only when the road was quite free ahead that they
went at great speed. They kept steadily on amongst the rising
mountains, only slackening as they passed to Thirlmere and dropped
down to Keswick. They did not stop here, but passing by the top of
Derwentwater drew up for a few minutes to look down the lake whose
wooded islands add so much to the loveliness of the view. Then on
again full speed by the borders of Bassenthwaite Lake and on amongst
the frowning hills to Cockermouth.

Joy was in a transport of delight the whole time. Her soul seemed to
be lifted by the ever-varying beauty of the panorama as they swept
along; and the rushing speed stirred her blood. She was silent, save
at ecstatic moments when she was quite unable to control herself.
Athlyne was silent too. He had been over the ground already, and
besides such driving required constant care and attention. He was more
than ever careful in his work, for was not Joy--his Joy!--his
passenger.

They did not stop at Cockermouth but turned into the main road and,
passing Bride-kirk--and Bothel, flew up to Carlisle. As he slowed down
at the city wall Athlyne looking at his watch said quietly:

“An hour and a half and some fifty miles. Let us go on and eat our
lunch in Scotland.”

“Oh do! Go on! Go on--darling! I forgot to tell you that I have had a
wire; they don’t get in till seven; so we have two more hours,” cried
Joy enthusiastically. This time she used the word of endearment
instinctively and without a pause. “Practice makes perfect” says the
old saw.

Athlyne controlled himself and went at quiet pace through the
Cumberland capital. He would like to have put the engine at full
speed; the last word had fired him afresh. However, he did not want to
get into police trouble. When he came out on the Northern road and
climbed the steep hill to Stanwix he felt freer. The road was almost a
dead level and there was little traffic, only a stray cart here and
there. Then he let go, and the car jumped forward like an eager horse.
Athlyne felt proud of it, just as though it had an intention of its
own--that it wanted to show Joy how it loved to carry her. Joy almost
held her breath as they swept along here. The wind whistled around her
head and she had to keep her neck stiff against the pressure of the
fifty-mile breeze. They slowed at the forking of the road beyond
Kingstown; and at the Esk bridge and its approaches; otherwise they
went at terrific speed till they reached the border where the road
crossed the Sark. Then, keeping the Lochberie road to the right, they
rushed away through Annan towards Dumfries.

Joy did not know that at that turning off to Annan they were almost in
touch with Gretna Green. Athlyne did not think of it at the time. Had
the knowledge or the thought of either been engaged on the subject the
temptation it would have brought might have been too much for lovers
in their rapturous condition … and the course of this history might
have been different.

The run to the outskirts of Dumfries, where the traffic increased, was
another wild rush which wrought both the occupants of the car to a
high pitch of excitement.

To Joy it seemed a sort of realisation. On the drive to Carlisle, and
from that on over the Border, the fringing hills of the Solway had
been a dim and mystery-provoking outline. But now the hills were at
hand, before them and to the north; whilst far across the waste of
banks and shoals of Solway Frith rose the Cumberland mountains, a
mighty piling mass of serrated blue haze. It was a convincing
recognition of the situation; this was Scotland, and England was far
behind! Instinctively she leaned closer to her companion at the
thought.

Between Dumfries and Castle Douglas was a long hill to climb within a
stretch of seven miles. But the Delaunay-Belleville breasted it nobly
and went up with unyielding energy. Then, when the summit at
Crocketford was reached, she ran down the hill to Urr Water with a
mighty rush which seemed to carry her over the lesser hill to Castle
Douglas. From thence the road to Dalry was magnificent for scenery. At
Crossmicheal it came close to the Ken whose left bank it followed
right up by Parton to “St. John’s Town of Dalry” where it crossed the
river. Athlyne had intended to rest a while somewhere about here; but
the old coach road, winding with the curves of the river, looked so
inviting that he ran a few miles up north towards Carsphairn. Coming
to a bye-road where grew many fine trees of beech and stone pine which
gave welcome shade, he ran up a few hundred yards to where the road
curved a little. Here was an ideal spot for a picnic, and especially
for a picnic of two like the present.

The curving of the road made an open space, which the spreading trees
above shaded. Deep grass was on the wide margin of the flat road which
presently dipped to cross a shallow rill of bright water which fell
from a little rocky ledge, tinkling happily through the hum of summer
insect life. Wildflowers grew everywhere. It was idyllic and
delightful and beautiful in every way, even to where, towering high
above a Druidic ruin in the foreground, the lofty hills of Carsphairn
rose far away between them and the western sky. In itself the scene
wanted for absolute perfection some figures in the foreground. And
presently it had them in a very perfect form. Joy clapped her hands
with delight like a happy child as she glanced around her. Athlyne
drew up sharp, and jumping from his seat held out his hand to Joy who
sprang beside him on the road. As they stood together when Joy’s wrap
had been removed they made a handsome couple. Both tall and slim and
elegant and strong. Both straight as lances; both bright and eager;
with the light of love and happiness shining on them more notably than
even the flicker of sunlight between the great stems and branches of
the trees. His brown hair seemed to match her black; the brown eyes
and the grey both were lit with a “light that never came from land or
sea!” Joy’s eyes fell under the burning glances of her lover; the time
had not yet come for that absolutely fearless recognition which, being
a man’s unconscious demand, a woman instinctively resists. Athlyne
recognised the delicacy and acquiesced. All this without a single
spoken word. Then he spoke:

“Was there ever such a magnificent run in the world. More than a
hundred miles on end without a break or pause. And every moment a
lifetime of bliss--to me at all events--Darling!”

“And to me!” Joy’s eyes flashed grey lightning as she raised them for
a moment to his, and held them there. Athlyne’s knees trembled with
delight; his voice quivered also as he spoke:

“And all the time I never left my duty once for an instant. I think I
ought to get a medal!”

“You should indeed, darling. And I never once distracted you from it
did I?”

“Unhappily, no!” His eyes danced.

“So I ought to get more than a medal!”

“What? What should you get--now?” His voice was a little hoarse. He
drew closer to her. She made no answer in words; but her eyes were
more eloquent. With a mutual movement she was in his arms and their
mouths met.

“And now for lunch!” he said as after a few entrancing seconds she
drew her face away. “I am sure you must be starving.”

“I _am_ hungry!” she confessed. Her face was still flushed and her
eyes were like stars. She bustled about to help him. He took the seats
and cushions from the tonneau and made a comfortable nest for her,
with a seat for himself close, very close beside her. He lifted off
the luncheon basket and unstrapped it. Whilst she took out the plates
and packets and spread the cloth he put a bottle of champagne and one
of fizzy water in the cool of the running stream.

They may have had some delightful picnics on Olympus in the days of
the old gods who were so human and who loved so much--and so often.
But surely there was none so absolutely divine as on that day that
under the trees, looking over at the grey piling summits of the
mountains of Carsphairn. The food was a dream, the wine was nectar.
The hearts of the two young people beat as one heart. Love surely was
so triumphant that there never could come a cloud into the sky which
hung over them like a blue canopy. Life and nature and happiness and
beauty and love took hands and danced around them fairy-like as they
sat together, losing themselves and their very souls in the depths of
each other’s eyes.




 CHAPTER XV.
 “STOP!”

Under the shading trees the time flew fast. It is ever thus in the
sylvan glades where love abides:

   “… The halcyon hours with double swiftness run
   And in the splendour of Arcadian summers
   The quicker climb the coursers of the sun.”

Athlyne and Joy sat in a gentle rapture of happiness. She had made him
draw up his cushion close to her so that she could lean against him.
They sat hand in hand for a while, and then one arm stole round her
and drew her close to him. She came yieldingly, as though such a
moment had been ordained since the beginning of the world. Her hand
stole inside his arm and held him tight; and so they sat locked
together, with their faces so close that their mouths now and again
met in long, sweet kisses. More than once was asked by either the old
question of lovers--which has no adequate or final answer: “Do you
love me?” And at each such time the answer was given in the fashion
which ruled in Eden--and ever since.

Presently Athlyne, drawing Joy closer than ever to him, said:

“Joy darling there is something I want to say to you!” He paused; she
drew him closer to her, and held him tighter. She realised that his
voice had changed a little; he was under some nervousness or anxiety.
This woke the protective instinct which is a part of woman’s love.

“We love each other?”

“I do!” As she spoke she looked at him with her great gray eyes
blazing. He kissed her:

“And I love you, my darling, more than I have words to say. More than
words can express. I am lost in you. You are my world, my hope, my
heaven! Beyond measure I love you, and honour you, and trust you; and
now that I feel you love me too … My dear! … my dear! the whole
world seems to swim around me and the heavens to open …”

“Dear, go on. It is music to me--all music--that I have so longed
for!”

“Darling! It seems like sacrilege to say anything just
now--but--but--You know I love you?”

“Yes!” The simple word was stronger than any embellishment; it was of
the completeness, the majesty, of sincerity in its expression.

“Then there is no need to say more of that now … But before I say
something else which I long to hear--in words, dear, for its truth is
already in my heart …”

“Darling!” she spoke the word lingeringly as though grudging that its
saying must end …

“Before such time I must speak with your father!” He spoke the words
with a gravity which brought a chill to her heart; her face blanched
suddenly as does liquid in the final crystallization of frost. Her
voice was faint--she was only a girl after all, despite her pride and
bravery--as she asked:

“Oh, I hope it is nothing. …”

“Nothing, darling” he said as he stroked tenderly the hand that lay in
his--he had taken his arm from her waist to do it--“except the
courtesy which is due to an old man … and one other thing, small in
itself--absolutely nothing in my own mind--which makes it necessary in
respect to his … his … his convictions that I should speak to him
before …” He stopped suddenly, remembering that if he went on he
must betray the secret which as yet he wished to keep. Not on his own
account did he wish to keep it. But there was Joy’s happiness to be
considered. Until he knew how Colonel Ogilvie would take the knowledge
of his having introduced himself under a false name he must not do or
say anything which might ultimately make difference between her and
her father.

Joy erred in her interpretation of his embarrassment, of his sudden
stopping. Again the pallor grew over her face which had under her
lover’s earlier words regained its normal colour. More faintly even
than before she whispered:

“It is nothing I hope that would keep us …” He saw her distress and
cut quickly into her question:

“No! No! No! Nothing that could ever come between you and me. It is
only this, Joy darling. Your father belongs to another country from my
own and an older generation than mine. His life has been different,
and the ideas that govern him are very masterful in their convention.
Were I to neglect this I might make trouble which would, without our
wish or part, come between us. Believe me, dear, that in this I am
wise.” Then seeing the trouble still in her eyes he went on: “I know
well, Joy, that it is not necessary for me to justify myself in your
eyes.” Here she strained him a little closer and held his arm and his
hand harder “but my dearest, I am going to do it all the same. I want
to say something, but which I mustn’t say yet, so that you must be
tolerant with me if I say unneeded things which are still open to me.
Truly, darling, there is absolutely nothing which could possibly come
between you and me. I have done no wrong--in that way at all events.
There should be no more difference between you and me for anything
that is now in my mind than there is between your soul and the blue
sky above us; between you and heaven. …” She put her hand over his
mouth:

“Oh hush, hush, dear. … By the way what am I to call you--darling?”
For the moment he was taken aback. To give her his own name as yet
would be to break the resolution of present secrecy; to give her a
false name now would be sacrilege. His native Irish wit stood him in
good stead:

“That is the name for to-day--darling. There can be none like
that--for to-day. We began with it. It took me on its wings up to
heaven. Let me stay there--for to-day. For to-day we are true husband
and wife--are we not?”

“Yes dear!” she answered simply. He went on:

“To-morrow … we can be grave to-morrow; and then I can give you
another name to use--if you wish it!”

“I do!” she said with reverence. She accepted and returned the kiss
which followed. This closed the incident, and for a little space they
sat hand in hand, his arm again round her whilst again she had linked
her arm in his. Presently he said:

“And now Joy dear, won’t you tell me all about yourself. You know that
as yet you and I know very little about each other’s surroundings. I
want specially to know to-day dear, for to-morrow I want to see your
father and it will be better to go equipped.” Joy felt quite in a
flutter. At last she was going to learn something about the man she
loved. She would tell him everything, and he would … Her thoughts
were interrupted by her companion going on:

“And then to-morrow when we have talked I can tell you everything.
…”

“Everything!” then there was something to conceal! Her heart fell. But
as the man continued, her train of thought was again interrupted:

“When you see him to-night you had better …”

Suddenly she jumped to her feet in a sort of fright. Seeing her face
he too sprang up, giving, with the instinct of his campaigning a quick
look around as though some danger threatened:

“What is it Joy? What is wrong? …” She almost gasped out:

“My father! He will be home by seven! It must be late in the afternoon
now and we are more than a hundred miles from home! …” Athlyne in
turn was staggered. In his happiness in being with Joy and talking of
love he had quite overlooked the passing of time. Instinctively he
looked at his watch. It was now close on four o’clock. … Joy was the
first to speak:

“Oh do let us hurry! No one knows where I am; and if when Daddy gets
home and finds I am not there he will be alarmed--and he may be upset.
And Mother and Aunt Judy too! … Oh do not lose a moment! If we do
not get home before they arrive … and Daddy finds I have been out
all day with you … Oh, hurry, hurry!”

Athlyne had been thinking hard whilst she spoke, and his thoughts had
been arranging themselves. His intelligence was all awake now. He
could see at a glance that Joy’s absence might make trouble for all.
Colonel Ogilvie was a man of covenance, and his daughter’s going out
with him in such a way was at least unconventional. She _must_ get
back in time! His conclusion was reached before she had finished
speaking. His military habit of quick action asserted itself; already
he was replacing the things in the carriage. Joy saw, and with
feverish haste began to help him. When he saw her at work he ran to
the engine and began to prepare for starting. When that was ready he
held Joy’s coat for her and helped her into her seat. As he took the
wheel he said as he began to back down the road which was hardly wide
enough to turn in:

“Forgive me, dear. It was all my selfish pleasure. But we shall do all
we can. Bar accident we may do it; we have over three hours!” He set
his teeth as he saw the struggle before him. It would be a glorious
run … and there was no use forestalling trouble. … Joy saw the
smile on his face, recognised the man’s strength, and was comforted.

They backed into the road and sprang southward. Without taking his
eyes off his work, Athlyne said:

“Tell me dear as we go along all that I must bear in mind in speaking
to your father of our marriage. …”

There! It was out unconsciously. Joy thrilled, but he did not himself
seem to notice his self-betrayal. He went on unconcernedly:

“It may be a little uphill at first if we do not get in line in time.”
Joy looked under her lashes at the strong face now set as a stone to
his work and kept silence as to the word. She was glad that she could
blush unseen. After a little pause she said in a meek voice:

“Very well, dear. I shall tell you whenever we are on a straight bit
of road, but I will be silent round the curves.” They were then flying
along the old coach road. The road was well-made, broad and with good
surface and they went at a terrific pace. Athlyne felt that the only
chance of reaching Ambleside was by taking advantage of every
opportunity for speed. Already he knew from the morning’s journey that
there were great opportunities as long stretches of the road were
level and in good order and were not unduly impeded with traffic. The
motor was running splendidly, it seemed as if the run in the morning
had put every part of it in good working order. He did not despair of
getting to Ambleside in time. The train was not due at Windermere till
seven. And it might be a little late. In any case it would take the
arriving party a little while to get their things together and then
drive to Ambleside. As they were sweeping down towards the bridge at
Dalry he said to Joy without looking round:

“It will be all right. I have been thinking it over. We can do it!”

“Thank God!” she exclaimed fervently. She too had been thinking.

“Stop!”

The voice rang out imperiously; and a policeman, stepping from behind
the trunk of a great beech, held up his hand. Instinctively Athlyne
began to slow. He shouted back “All right!” He had grasped the
situation and as they were out of earshot of the policeman said
quickly to Joy:

“We are arrested! Oh, I am sorry darling. If they won’t let me pay a
fine and go at once you must take the car on. I shall try to arrange
that. But do be cautious dear--you are so precious to me. If you are
delayed anywhere and can’t make it in time wire to your father tell
him you are motoring and have been delayed. It will soften matters,
even if he is angry. I shall go on by train in the morning. And
darling if you are not getting on as you wish, take a train the best
you can--a special. Don’t stop at any expense. But get on! And don’t
tell your name to any one, under any circumstances. Don’t forget the
telegram if delayed.” As he was speaking the car was slowing and the
panting policeman was coming up behind. When the car stopped, Athlyne
jumped out and walked towards the officer; he wanted to be as
conciliatory as possible.

“I am very sorry, officer. That beautiful bit of road tempted me; and
being all quite clear I took a skim down it?”

“Ye did! Man, but it was fine! But I hae to arrest ye all the same.
Duty is duty!”

“Certainly. I suppose the station is across the bridge?”

“Aye sir.” The policeman, who at first sight had from his dress taken
him for a chauffeur, had by now recognised him as a gentleman.

“Will you come in the car? It’s all right. I’ll go slow.”

“Thank ye sir. I’ve had a deal o’ walkin’ the day!” When the man was
in the tonneau Athlyne who had been thinking of what was to be done
said to him affably:

“It was silly of me going at such a pace. But I wanted my wife to see
how the new car worked.” He had a purpose in saying this: to emphasise
to Joy the necessity of not mentioning her name. It was the only way
to keep off the subject when they should get to the station. Joy
turned away her head. She did not wish either man to see her furious
blushing at hearing the word. She took the hint; silence was her cue.

At the station Joy sat in the car whilst Athlyne went inside with the
officer. The sergeant was a grave elderly man, not unkindly. He too
recognised, but at once, that the chauffeur was a gentleman. There was
an air of distinction about Athlyne which no one, especially an
official, could fail to appreciate. He was not surprised when he read
the card which Athlyne handed to him. He frowned a little and
scratched his head.

“I fear this’ll be a bit awkward my lord. Ye come frae o’er the Border
and ye’ll hae to attend the summons at New Galloway. I dinna want to
inconvenience you and her ladyship but …”

“Will it not be possible to let the car go on. My wife has to meet her
father and mother who are coming up to Ambleside to-night, and they
will be so disappointed. Her mother is an invalid and is coming from
Italy. I shall be really greatly obliged if it can be managed.”

The sergeant shook his head and said slowly:

“’Tis a fine car. A valuable commodity to take out of the jurisdiction
and intil a foreign country.” Athlyne had already taken out his
pocket-book. Fortunately he had provided himself well with money
before coming north.

“I paid a thousand pounds for the car. Will it not suit if I leave
that amount in your custody.” The official was impressed.

“Losh! man what wad I be daen wi’ a thoosan poons in a wee bit station
like this, or carryin’ it aboot in me claes. Na! na! if ye’ll
de-po-sit say a ten poon note for the guarantee I’m thinkin’ ’twill be
a’ reet. But how can the leddy get ava; ye’ll hae to bide till the
morn’s morn.”

“Oh that’s all right, officer, she’s a licensed driver. Unhappily she
has not got her license with her. She left it in Ambleside as I was
driving myself and had mine.” He said this to avert her being
questioned on the neglect; in which case there might be more trouble
about the pace.

“Ooh! aye. Then that’s a’ reet! A maun ax her masel forbye she mayn’t
hae the license aboot her. Wimmen is feckless cattle anyhow!”

“Do you think sergeant she may get away at once. It is a long drive,
and the day is getting on. I shall be very grateful indeed if you can
manage it!” The sergeant was still impressed by the pocket book.

“Weel A’ll see what A can dae!” He went outside with Athlyne to the
automobile, and touching his cap said:

“Yer pardon ma leddy, ye’re the wife o’ the defender?” Joy was glad
that she had put on the motor veil attached to her cap.

“Yes! My husband told you, did he not?” she said. The thrill that came
to her with the speaking of the word “husband” she kept for later
thought. The sergeant answered respectfully:

“He did ma leddy. But as an offeecial o’ the law I hae to make sure as
ye’re aboot to travel oot o’ the jurisdiction. He says ye hae left yer
licence at hame; but as ye hae answered me that ye are his wife I will
accept it, an’ ye may go. The defender remains here; but I’m thinkin’
there’s a chance that he may no hae to remain so lang as he’s fearin!
Ma service to ye ma leddy.” He touched his cap and went back into the
station.

Athlyne came forward and said in a low voice, for the policeman who
had effected the arrest was now standing outside the door:

“You will be careful darling. You may be able to do it. But if you are
late and your father be angry say as little as you can. Unhappily I
must remain here, but I shall do all I possibly can to settle things
quietly. I shall follow in the morning; but not too early. Don’t
forget to wire your father if you are delayed anywhere, or are certain
to be late. For my own part I shall leave proof everywhere of my own
presence as we shall be in different countries!” He said this as it
occurred to him that if she should be delayed it might later avert a
scandal. Then he spoke up for the benefit of the policeman:

“As the time is so short, and we have learned the lesson of the danger
of going too fast, you might ask when you get to Carlisle whether it
is not quicker to return by Penrith and Patterdale. That way is some
miles shorter.” The policeman who had heard--and had also seen the
pocket-book--came close and said with a respectful touch of his cap:

“If A may make sae bold, the leddy can save a wheen o’ miles by takin’
the road to Dumfries by Ken Brig an’ Crocketford up yon. A saw ye the
morn comin’ up there.” Athlyne nodded and touched his pocket; the man
drew back into the station. One last word to Joy:

“I wish you knew the machine darling. But we must take chance for all
going well.” As he spoke he was turning the starting handle. Joy in a
low voice said:

“Good bye my darling!” Resolutely she touched the levers, and the car
moved off quietly to the “God bless you!” of each.

Athlyne watched the car as long as it was in sight; then he went back
into the station. He spoke at once to the sergeant.

“Now sergeant is there nothing that can possibly be done to hasten the
matter. You see I have done all I can to obey rules--once having
broken them. I am most anxious to get back home as I have some very
important business in the morning. I shall of course do exactly as is
necessary; but I shall be deeply obliged if I can get away quietly,
and double deeply to you if you can arrange it.”

“Well ma lord I dinna think ye’ll hae much trouble or be delayed o’er
lang neither. For masel A canna do aught; but A’m thinkin that the
Sheriff o’ Galloway himsel will be here ony moment. He nearly always
rides by when the fair at Castle Douglas is on, as it is to be in the
morn. A’ll hae a sharp look oot for him. He’s a kind good man; an A’m
thinkin that he’ll no fash yer lordship. He can take responsibeelity
that even a sargeant o’ polis daurn’t. So it’s like ye’ll get ava
before the nicht.”

Athlyne sat himself down to wait with what patience he could muster.
Once again nature’s pendulum began to swing in his thoughts; on one
side happiness, on the other anxiety. The delight of the day wherein
he had realised to the full that Joy indeed loved him, even as he
loved her; the memory of those sweet kisses which still tingled on his
lips and momentarily exalted him to a sort of rapture; and then the
fear which was manifold, selfish and unselfish. She might get into any
one of many forms of trouble if only from her anxiety to reach home
before the arrival of her parents. She was, after all, not a practiced
driver; and was in control of the very latest type of machine of whose
special mechanism she could know nothing. If she should break down far
from any town she would be in the most difficult position possible: a
girl all alone in a country she did not know. And all this apart from
the possibility of accident, of mischance of driving; of the act of
other travellers; of cattle on the road; of any of the countless
mishaps which can be with so swift and heavy a machine as a motor. And
then should she not arrive in time, what pain or unpleasantness might
there not be with her father. He would be upset and anxious at first,
naturally. He might be angry with her for going out on such a long
excursion with a man alone; he would most certainly be angry with him
for taking her, for allowing her to go. And at such a time too! Just
when everything was working--had worked towards the end he aimed at.
He knew that Colonel Ogilvie was and had been incensed with him for a
neglect which under the circumstances was absolute discourtesy. And
here he bitterly took himself to task for his selfishness--he realised
now that it was such--in wanting to make sure of Joy’s love before
consulting her father, or even explaining to him the cause of his
passing under a false name. Might it not be too late to set that right
now. … And there he was, away in Scotland, kicking his heels in a
petty little police station, while the poor girl would have to bear
all the brunt of the pain and unpleasantness. And that after a long,
wearying, wearing drive of a hundred miles, with her dear heart
eternally thumping away lest she might lose in her race against Time.
And what was worse still that it would all follow a day which he did
not attempt to doubt had been, up to the time of the arrest, one of
unqualified happiness.

   “… nessun maggoir dolore
   Che ricordasi del tempo felice
   Nella miseria.”

  (“A sorrow’s crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.”)

The contrast would be terrible. He knew what the thought of it was to
him; what would it be to her! Her sweet, gentle, loving heart would be
hurt, crushed to the very dust.

He sprang to his feet and walked about the room, till noticing the
sergeant was watching him with surprise and suspicion, he controlled
himself.

He talked with the sergeant for a while genially. It was positively
necessary that there should not be any doubt in the mind of the latter
when the Sheriff should arrive. This episode took the strain from his
mind--for a time. He expressed to the officer how anxious he was to
get on and interested the worthy man so much that he sent over to the
hotel to borrow a time-table. There Athlyne learned that it would be
practically impossible for him to get on to Ambleside that night. Not
even if he could get a special train at Carlisle--there was no
possibility of getting one from a nearer place. When he asked the
sergeant his opinion, that grave individual condescended to smile:

“Losh! man they don’t run specials on these bit lines. ’Tis as much as
they can do to run a few trains a day. A’m thinkin’ that if ye asked
the stationmaster anywheer along the Dumfries and Kircudbright line
for a special he’d hae ye in the daft-hoose, or he’d be there himsel!”
Athlyne went back to his seat; once again the pendulum of his thoughts
swung to and fro.

He was now face to face with one certainty amongst many possibilities:
Whatever befel he could not give any immediate help to Joy. She, poor
dear, must fend for herself and if need be, fight her battle alone. He
could only try to make it up to her afterwards. And yet what could he
do for her, what more give to her who had already all that was his!
And here again he lost himself in memories of the immediate past;
which presently merged into dreams of the future which has no end.

But again swung the pendulum with the thought of what he was next day
to do which might help Joy. He began to realise out of the intensity
of his thought, which was now all unselfish, in what a danger of
misconception the girl stood already and how such might be multiplied
by any accident of her arrival. In the eyes of her friends her very
character might be at stake! And now he made up his mind definitely as
to how he would protect her in that way. He could prove his time of
leaving Ambleside by his chauffeur, the time of that swift journey
would be its own proof; the time of his arrest was already proved.
Likewise of Joy’s departure for home. Henceforward till he should meet
her father he would take care that his movements were beyond any
mystery or suspicion whatever. In any case--even if she did not arrive
at home till late--Joy would be actually in another country from that
which held him, and the rapidity of her journey would in itself
protect. He would stay in some hotel in a place where he could get a
suitable train in the morning; and would arrange that his arrival and
departure were noted.

Naturally the place he would rest for the night, if he should succeed
in getting away, would be Castle Douglas; for here lines from
Kirkcudbright, from Stranraer, and from Glasgow made junction so that
he had a double chance of departure. If he were detained at Dalry the
police themselves would be proof of his presence there.

He felt easier in his mind after this decision, and was able to await
with greater patience the coming of the Sheriff.




 CHAPTER XVI.
 A PAINFUL JOURNEY

Joy started on her long journey in a very agitated frame of mind;
though the habit of her life and her concern for her lover enabled her
to so bear herself that she appeared calm. To start with, she was full
of fears; some of them natural, others of that class which is due to
the restrictions and conventions of a woman’s life. She was by no
means an expert driver. She merely had some lessons and was never in
an automobile by herself before. Moreover she was not only in a
country strange to her, but even the road to Dumfries on which she was
started was absolutely new to her. In addition to it all she was--as
an American--handicapped by the difference in the rules of the road.
In America they follow the French and drive on the off side: in
England the “on” rule is correct.

She had no option, however; she dared not make any difficulty or even
ask advice or help, for such might betray her and she might not be
allowed to proceed at all. So with as brave a face and bearing as she
could muster, but with a sinking heart, she started on her journey,
praying inwardly that she might not meet with any untoward accident or
difficulty. For she did not know anything about mechanism; the use of
the wheel and the levers in driving was all that had been embraced in
her lessons.

At first all went well enough. The road was clear and she felt that
she had the machine well in hand. As far as Balmaclellan she went
slowly, carefully, climbing laboriously up the steep zig-zag road; and
presently she began to feel in good heart. She did not know the name
of the place; had never heard of it. But it was somewhere; one stage
at least on the way home. When the village lay behind her she began to
put on more speed. With the apprehension gone of not being able to get
on at all, she began to think of her objective and of how long was the
journey before it could be revealed. With increased speed, however,
came fresh fears. The importance of the machine began to be manifest;
such force and speed needed special thought. The road changed so
rapidly that she felt that she wanted another pair of eyes. The wheel
alone, with its speed and steering indices, took all attention. She
hardly dared to look up from it. And yet if she did not how could she
know the road to take; how could she look out for danger. Happily the
mere movement was a tonic; the rush through the air braced her.
Otherwise she would have been shortly in a state of panic.

Very soon she began to realise the difficulty of driving on an unknown
road, when one is not skilled in the art. So many things have to be
considered all at once, and the onus of choosing perpetually is of
nightmare shadow. The openings of bye-roads and cross-roads are so
much more important than is suspected that there is a passing doubt as
to direction; and country roads generally wind about so that distant
land-marks, which can guide one in general direction, come and go with
embarrassing suddenness. At first every cart-track or farm-road made
such doubts, and even when she got to understand such minor trends she
got confused over bye-roads of more importance. Cross-roads there were
before long, right or left making shortcuts for those who knew. These
she had to pass; she could judge only of her course by the excellence
of the main road--not always a safe guide in remote agricultural
districts. One thing told in her favour: the magnificent bracing air
of that splendid high-hung moor through which she passed. By the time
she got to Corsock, however, she was beginning to feel the strain
severely. She was hot and nervous and wearied; only the imperative
need of getting on, and getting on quickly, enabled her to keep up at
all. At Corsock she stopped to ask the way, but found it hard to
understand the Lowland Scotch in which directions for her guidance
were given. The result was that she started afresh with a blank
despair gripping at her heart. Already she felt that her effort to
reach home in time was destined to failure. The time seemed to fly so
fast, the miles to be so long. She even began to feel a nervous doubt
as to whether she should even be able to send word to her father. East
of Corsock the nature of the road is confusing to a stranger. There
are bye-roads leading south and up northwards into the mountains; and
Urr Water has to be crossed. Joy began to lose the perspective of
things; her doubts as to whether she was on the right road became
oppressive. Somehow, things were changing round her. Look where she
would, she could not see the hill tops that had been her landmarks. A
mist was coming from the right hand--that was the south, where was
Solway Firth. Then she gave up heart altogether. There came to her
woman’s breast the reaction from all the happy excitement of the day.
It was too bright to last. And now came this shadow of trouble worse
even than the mist which seemed to presage it … Oh, if only He were
with her now … He! … Strange it was that in all that day she had
not once spoken to him by name. “Dear” or “Darling” seemed more
suitable when her hand was in his; when he was kissing her. She closed
her eyes in an ecstasy of delightful remembrance … She was recalled
to herself by a sudden jar; in her momentary forgetfulness she had run
up a bank.

It was a shock to her when her eyes opened to see how different were
her surroundings from her thoughts. Those hours when they sat together
where the sunbeams stole through the trees would afford her many a
comparison in the time to come. All was now dark and dank and chill.
The mist was thickening every instant; she could hardly see the road
ahead of her.

However, she had to go on, mist or no mist; at least till she should
reach some place whence she could telegraph to her father. With a pang
she realised that she must not wire also to Him as she would have
loved to have done. It would only upset and alarm him, poor fellow!
and he had quite anxiety enough in thinking of her already! … With a
heavy heart she crawled along through the mist, steering by the
road-bed as well as she could, keeping a sharp look-out for
cross-roads and all the dangers of the way.

The time seemed to fly, but not the car; the road appeared to be
endless. Would she never come to any hospitable place! … It was a
surprise to her when she came on straggling cottages, and found
herself between double rows of houses. Painted over a door she saw
“Crocketford Post-Office.” In her heart she thanked God that she was
still on the right road, though she had only as yet come some dozen or
more miles. It seemed as if a week had passed since she left Dalry …
and … She drew up to the post-office and went in. There she sent a
wire:

“Went out motoring caught here in mist am going on however but must
arrive very late so do not be anxious about me. Love to Mother and
Aunt Judy and dear Daddy. Joy.”

When she had handed it in she looked at her watch. It was only
half-past five o’clock!

It was still therefore on the verge of possibility that she might get
back in time. She hurried out. Several people had gathered round the
motor, which was throbbing away after the manner of motors, as though
impatient to get to real work. A policeman who was amongst them,
seeing that she was about to go on, suggested that she should have her
lamps lit as it would be a protection as well as a help to her in the
mist. She was about to say that she thought it would be better not;
for she did not know anything about acetylene lamps and feared to
expose her ignorance, when he very kindly offered to light them for
her:

“’Tis no wark for a bonny leddy!” he said in self-justification of
bending his official dignity to the occasion. She felt that his
courtesy demanded some explanation, and also that such explanation
would, be accounting for her being all alone, avoid any questioning.
So said sweetly:

“Thank you so much, officer. I really do not know much about lamps
myself and I had to leave my … my husband, who was driving, at
Dalry. He was going too fast, and your people had a word to say to
him. However, I can get on all right now. This is a straight road to
Dumfries is it not?” The road was pointed out and instructions given
to keep the high road to Dumfries. With better heart and more courage
than heretofore she drove out into the mist. There was comfort for her
in the glare of the powerful lights always thrown out in front of her.

All went well now. The road was distinctly good, and the swift smooth
motion restored her courage. When in about half an hour she began to
note the cottages and houses grouping in the suburbs of Dumfries she
got elated. She was now well on the way to England! She knew from
experience that the road to Annan, by which they had come, was fairly
level. She did not mind the mist so much, now that she was accustomed
to it; and she expected that as it was driving up northwards from the
Firth she would be free from it altogether when she should have passed
the Border and was on her way south to Carlisle.

In the meanwhile she was more anxious than as yet. The mist seemed to
have settled down more here than in the open country. There were
lights in many windows in the suburbs, and the street lamps were lit.
It is strange how the perspective of lines of lamps gets changed when
one is riding or driving or cycling in mist or fog. If one kept the
centre of the road it would be all right; but as one keeps of
necessity to the left the lines between the lamps which guide the eye
change with each instant. The effect is that straight lines appear to
be curved; and if the driver loses nerve and trusts to appearances he
will soon come to grief. This was Joy’s first experience of driving in
mist, and she naturally fell into the error. She got confused as to
the right and wrong side of the road. She had to fight against the
habit of her life, which instinctively took command when her special
intention was in abeyance. She knew that from Dumfries the road
dropped to the south-east and as the curve seemed away to the left
from her side of the road she, thinking that the road to the left was
the direct road, naturally inclined towards the right hand, when she
came to a place where there were roads to choose. There was no one
about from whom to ask the way; and she feared to descend from the car
to look for a sign-post. The onus of choice was on her, and she took
the right hand thinking it was straight ahead. For some time now she
had been going slow, and time and distance had both spun out to
infinitude; she had lost sense of both. She was tired, wearied to
death with chagrin and responsibility. Everything around her was new
and strange and unknown, and so was full of terrors. She did not know
how to choose. She feared to ask lest the doing so might land her in
new embarrassments. She knew that unless she got home in something
like reasonable time her father would be not only deeply upset but
furiously angry--and all that anger would be visited on Him. Oh she
must get on! It was too frightful to contemplate what might happen
should she have to be out all night … and after having gone out with
a man against whom her father had already a grievance, though he owed
him so much!

The change in the road, however, gave her some consolation; it was
straight and smooth, and as the wind was now more in her face she felt
that she was making southward. But her physical difficulties were
increasing. The wind was much stronger, and the mist came boiling up
so fast that her goggles got blurred more than ever. Everything around
her was becoming wet.

For a few miles--she could only guess at the distance--all went well,
and she got back some courage. She still went slowly and carefully;
she did not mean to have any mischance now if she could help it. It
would not be so very long before she was over the Border. Then most
likely she would be out of the mist and she could put on more speed.

Presently she felt that the car was going up a steep incline. When it
had been running swiftly she had not felt such, but now it was
apparent. It was not a big hill, however, and the run down the other
side was exhilarating, though the fear of some obstacle in front
damped such pleasure as there was. Even then the pace was not fast;
ordinarily it would have been considered as little better than a rapid
crawl. For a while, not long but seeming more than long, the road was
up-and-down till she saw in the dimness of the mist glimpses of
houses, then a few gleams of light from the chinks of shut windows.
Here she went very slowly and tooted often. She feared she might do
some harm; and the slightest harm now might mean delay. She breathed
more freely when she was out in the open again. That episode of the
arrest and the prolonged agitation which followed it had unnerved her
more than she had thought; and now the mist and the darkness and the
uncertainty were playing havoc with her. It was only when she was long
past the little place that she regretted she had not stopped to ask if
she was on the right road. There was nothing for it, however, but to
go on. The road was all up and down, up and down; but the surface was
fairly good, and as the powerful lamps showed her sufficient space
ahead to steer she moved along, though it had to be with an agonising
slowness. How different it all was, she thought, from that
fairy-chariot driving with Him in the morning. The road then seemed
straight and level, and movement was an undiluted pleasure! For an
instant she closed her wearied eyes as she sighed at the change--and
ran off the road-bed.

Happily she was going slowly and recovered herself before more than
the front wheels were on the rough mass of old road-scrapings. In a
couple of seconds she had backed off and was under way again. She was
preternaturally keen now in her outlook. She felt the strain acutely;
for the road seemed to be always curving away from her. Moreover there
was another cause of concern. Night was coming on. Even in the densest
mist or the blackest fog the light or darkness of the sky is to some
degree apparent. Now the sense came on her that over the thick mist
was darkness. She stopped a moment and getting out looked at her watch
in the light of the lamps.

Her heart fell away, away. It was now close to _eight_ o’clock. There
was no use worrying she felt; nothing to be done but to go on,
carefully for the present. When she made up her mind to the worst, her
courage began to come back and she could think. She felt that as the
wind was now strongly in her face she must be nearing the Firth, and
that in time she would pass the Border and be heading for home and
father. She jumped into her seat and was off again.

The fog--she realised now that it was not mist but fog--was thicker
than ever; the wind being strongly in her face, it seemed above the
glare of the powerful lamps, to come boiling up out of the roadway
which she could see but dimly. Fear, vague and gaunt, began to
overshadow her. But there was no use worrying or thinking of anything
except the immediate present which took the whole of her thought and
attention. In the face of her surroundings she dared not go fast,
dared not stop. And so for a time that seemed endless she pressed on
through the fog. Presently she became aware that the wind was now not
so much in her teeth. As she was steering by the road-bed she did not
notice curves; there was no doubt as to her route, as there did not
seem to be any divergent roads at all. On, on, on, on! A road full of
hills, not very high nor especially steep but enough to keep a driver
on constant watch-out.

At last she felt that she was close to the sea. The wind came
fiercely, and the drifting fog seen against the luminous area round
the lamps seemed like a whirlpool. There was a salt smell in the air.
This gave her some hope. If this were the Firth she must be close to
the Border and would soon be at the bridge over which they had entered
Scotland. Instinctively she went forward faster. And at last there
surely was a bridge. A narrow enough bridge it was; as she went slowly
across it she wondered how it was that they had seemed to fly over it
in the morning.

However she could go on now in new hope. She was in England and bye
and bye she would come through the fog-belt, and having passed
Carlisle would drop down through the Lake roads to Ambleside. Though
the fog was dense as ever she did not feel the wind so much; she
crowded on--she did not dare go much faster as yet and as she was now
climbing a long steep hill she ceased to notice it. After a while,
when there came a stronger puff than usual, she noticed that it was on
her back--the high hood of the car had protected her for some time
past. After a little however the old fear came back upon her. At the
present rate of progress to reach home at any time, however late,
seemed an impossibility. And all was so dark, and the fog was so
dense; and the road didn’t seem a bit like that they had come by
between Carlisle and the Border. All at once she found that she was
crying--crying bitterly. She did not want to stop the car, and so
dared not take her hands from the wheel, even to find her
pocket-handkerchief. She wept and wept; wept her heart out, whilst all
the time mechanically steering by the light of the lamps on the road.
Her weeping aided the density of the fog, and with her eyes set on the
road and the driving wheel in her hands she did not notice that she
was going between houses. She came to a bridge, manifestly of a little
more importance than the one she had already passed, and crossed it.
The road swayed away to the left; presently this was crossed by
another almost at right angles, but she kept straight on. There was no
one from whom to ask the way; and had there been anyone she probably
would not have seen him. A little way on there was another cross-road
but of minor importance; then further on she came to a place of
difficult choice. Another cross-road, again almost at right angles;
but the continuance of the road she was on showed it to be but a poor
road ill-kept. So, too, was that to her left; but the road to the
right was broad and well kept. It was undoubtedly the main road; and
so keeping to the rule she had hitherto obeyed, she followed it.

She was now feeling somehow in better heart; the fit of crying had
relieved her, and some of her courage had come back. She wanted
comforting--wanted it badly; but those whose comfort only could
prevail were far away; one behind her in Scotland, the others still
far away at Ambleside. The latter thought made her desperate. She put
on more speed--and with her thoughts and anxieties not in the present
but the future, ran up a steep bank. There was a quick snap of
something in front of the car; the throbbing of the engine suddenly
ceased. With the shock she had been thrown forward upon the wheel, but
fortunately the speed had not been great enough to cause her serious
injury. The lamps made the fog sufficiently luminous for her
movements, and she scrambled out of the car. She knew she could do
nothing, for she was absolutely ignorant of the mechanism, and she had
no mechanical skill. The only thing she could do was to go along the
road on the blind chance of meeting or finding some one who could help
her, or who might be able to assist her in finding better help. And so
with a heavy heart, and feet that felt like lead, she went out into
the fog. It was a wrench for her to leave the car which in the
darkness and the unknown mystery of the fog seemed by comparison a
sort of home or shelter. It was an evidence of the mechanical habit of
the mind, which came back to her later, that through all her weariness
and distress she thought to pin up her white frock before setting out
on the dusty journey.

It was astonishing how soon the little patch of light disappeared.
When she had taken but a few steps she looked back and found all as
dark as it was before her. One thing alone there was which saved her
from utter despair: the fog seemed not to be so absolutely dense. In
reality it was not that the fog had lessened, but that her eyes, so
long accustomed to the glare of the lamps which had prevented her
seeing beyond the radius of their power, had now come back to their
normal focus. Though the darkness seemed more profound than ever,
since there was no point of light whatever, she was actually able to
see better. After all, this fog was a sea mist unladen with city
smoke, and its darkness was a very different thing from the Cimmerian
gloom of a city fog. To her, not accustomed to winter fogs, it was
difficult and terrifying. When, however, she began to realise, though
unconsciously, that the nebulous wall in front of her fell back with
every step she took, her heart began to beat more regularly, and she
breathed more freely. It was a terrible position for a delicately
nurtured girl to be in. Though she was a brave girl with a full share
of self-reliance her absolute ignorance of all around her--even as to
what part of the country she was in--had a somewhat paralysing effect
upon her. However she had courage and determination. Her race as well
as her nature told for her. Her heart might beat hard and her feet be
heavy but at any rate she would go on her set road whilst life and
strength and consciousness remained to her. She shut her teeth, and in
blind despair moved forward in the fog.

In all her after life Joy could never recall the detail of that
terrible walk. Like most American girls she was unused to long walks;
and after a couple of miles she felt wearied to death. The long
emotional strain of the day had told sorely on her strength, and the
hopeless nerve-racking tramp on the unknown road through the gloom and
mystery of the fog had sapped her natural strength. Looking back on
that terrible journey she could remember no one moment from the other,
from the time that she lost sight of the lamps until she found herself
in a dip in the road passing under a railway bridge. The recognition
of the fact reanimated her. It was an evidence that there was some
kind of civilisation somewhere--a fact that she had begun in a vague
way to doubt. She would follow that line if she could, for it must
lead her to some place where she might find help; where she could send
reassuring word to her father, and where there would be shelter.
Shelter! At the first gleam of hope her own deplorable position was
forced upon her, and she realised all at once her desperate weariness.
She could now hardly drag herself along.

Beyond the railway there was a branch road to the left; and this she
determined to follow, rather than the main road which went away from
the line. She stumbled along it as well as she could. The time seemed
endless. In her weariness the flicker of hope which her juxtaposition
to the railway had given her died soon away. The fog seemed denser,
and the darkness blacker than ever.

The road dipped again under the line; she was glad of that; manifestly
she was not straying from it. She hurried on instinctively; found the
road wider, and rougher with much use. Her heart beat hard once again,
but this time it was with hope.

And then, right in front of her, was a dim gleam of light. This so
overcame her that she had to sit down for a moment on the road side.
The instant’s rest cheered her; she jumped to her feet as though her
strength had been at once restored. Feeling in her heart a prayer
which her lips had not time to utter, she climbed over a wire fence
between her and the light; stumbled across a rough jumble of sleepers
and railway irons. Then the light was over her head--the rays were
manifest on the fog. She called out:

“Hullo! Hullo! Is there any one awake?” Almost instantly the window
through which the light shone was opened and a man looked out:

“Aye! A’m awake! Did ye think A’d be sleepin’ on a nicht like this.
’Tis nae time for a signal-man to be aught but awake A’m tellin’ ye.”

“Thank God, oh thank God!” Joy’s heart was too full for the moment to
say more. The man leaned further out:

“Is yon a lassie? What are ye daein’ here a nicht like this? Phew! A
canna see ma ain hond!”

“Yes, I’m a girl and I’m lost. Will you let me come in?” The man’s
voice became instantly suspicious.

“Na! na! A canna let ye in. ’Tis no in accord wi’ the Company’s rules
to let a lassie intil the signal-box. Why don’t ye go intil the toon?”

“Oh do let me in for a moment,” she pleaded. “I have been lost in the
fog, and my motor broke down. I have had to walk so far that I am
wearied and tired and frightened; and the sight of a light and the
hope of help has finished me!” She sat right down on the ground and
began to cry. He heard her sob, and it woke all the man in him. This
was no wandering creature whose presence at such a time and place
might make trouble for him. He knew from the voice that the woman was
young and refined.

“Dinna greet puir lassie!--Dinna greet. A canna leave the box for an
instant lest a signal come. But go roond to the recht and ye’ll find a
door. Come recht up! Rules or no rules A’m no gangin’ to let ye greet
there all by yer lanes. There’s fire here, and when ye’re warmed A can
direct ye on yer way intil the toon!”

With glad steps she groped her way to the door. A flood of light
seemed to meet her when she opened it, and she hurried up the steep
stairs to where the signal-man held open the upper door.

“Coom in lassie an hae a soop o’ ma tea. ’Tis fine and warrm! … Coom
in and let me offer ye some refreshment, an’ if A may mak sae bold may
A offer ye all A hae that’ll warm ye? Coom in ma’am. Coom in ma
leddie!” he said in a crescendo of welcome and respect as he saw Joy’s
fine motor coat and recognised her air of distinction.

Glad indeed was Joy to drink from the worthy fellow’s tin tea-bottle
which rested beside the stove; glad to sit down in front of the fire.
Then indeed she felt the magnitude of her weariness, and in a minute
would have been asleep.

But the thought of her father, and all that depended on her action and
his knowledge, wakened her to full intellectual activity. She stood up
at once and said quickly:

“What place is this?”

“The signal-box of Castle Douglas Junction.”

“And where is that? I think I have heard the name before.”

“’Tis a toon as they ca’ it here. The junction is o’ the Glasgie an’
South Western, the Caledonian, the Port Patrich an’ Wigtownshire, the
London an’ North Western, an’ the Midland lines. But for short there
are but twa. One frae Kirkcudbright, an’ th’ ither frae Newton
Stewart.”

“In what country are we?” Seeing the astonishment in his face she went
on: “I am an American, and not familiar with the district. We came
from England this morning--from Westmoreland--from Ambleside--and I am
confused about the Border. I had to drive myself because my--we got
into trouble for driving fast, and I had to come on alone. And then
the fog overtook me. I went along as well as I could. Are we anywhere
near Carlisle?” Her face fell as she saw the shake of his head:

“Eh ma leddie but ye’re mony a mile frae Carlisle. ’Tis over fifty
miles be the line. Ye maun hae lost yer way sair. Ye’re in
Kirkcudbright-shire the noo.” Her heart sank:

“Oh I must send a telegram at once.”

“Ye canna telegraph the nicht ma leddie! The office is closed till
eight the morn’s morn.”

“My God! What shall I do. My father arrived from London to-night and
he does not know where I am. I came out for a drive and thought to be
back in good time to meet him. He will be in despair. Is there no way
in which I can send word? It is not a matter of expenses; I shall pay
anything if it can be done!” She looked at him in an agony of
apprehension. The man was stirred by the depth of emotion and by her
youth and beauty; and his clever Scotch brain began to work. His mouth
set fast in a hard line and his rough heavy brows began to wrinkle.
After a pause he said:

“A’ll do what A can, ma leddie; though A can’t be sure if ’twill wark.
The telegraphs are closed. Even if we could find an operator it
wouldn’t be possible to get the wires. Our own lines are closed, for
we’ll hae no traffic till morn.” Here an idea struck Joy and she
interrupted him:

“Could I not get a special train? I am willing to pay anything?”

“Lord love ye, ma leddy, they don’t have specials on bit lines like
this. Ye couldn’t get one nigher than Glasgie, an’ not there at this
time o’ day. Let alone they’d no send in such a fog anyhow. But I’m
thinkin’ that A can telephone to Dumfries. The operator o’ oor line
there is a freend o’ mine, an’ if he’s on dooty he’ll telephone on to
Carlisle wheer there’s sure to be some one at the place. An’ mayhap
the latter’ll telephone on till Ambleside. So, if there be any awake
there, they’ll send to the hotel. Is it a hotel yer faither’ll be in?”

“Oh thank you, thank you,” said Joy seizing his hand in a burst of
gratitude. “I’ll be for ever grateful to you if you’ll be so good!”

“A’m thinkin’” he went on “that perhaps ’twill cost yer ladyship a
mickle--perhaps a muckle; but A dar say ye’ll no mind that …”

“Oh no, no! It will be pleasure to pay anything. See, I have plenty of
money!” She pulled out her purse.

“Na! na! Not yet ma leddie. ’Tis no for masel--unless yer ladyship
insists on it, later on. ’Tis for the laddies that will do what they
can. Ye see there may be some trouble o’er this. We signal-men and
offeecials generally are not supposed to attend to aught outside o’
the routine. But if it should be that there is trouble to us puir
folk, A’m sure yer ladyship an’ some o’ yer graan’ freens’ll no see us
wranged!”

“Oh no indeed. My father and Mr. ---- and all our friends will see to
it that you shall never suffer, no matter what happens.”

“Well now, ma leddy--if ye’ll joost write down your message A’ll do
what A can. But ’twill be wiser if ye gang awa intil a hotel an’ rest
ye. A can send the message better when A’m quit o’ ye. Forbye ye see
’tis no quite respectable to hae a bonny lassie here ower lang. Ma
wife is apt to be a wee jalous; an’ it’s no wise to gie cause where
nane there is.”

“But I do not know where to go--” she began. He interrupted her
hastily:

“There’s a graan hotel i’ the toon--verra fine it is; but A’m thinkin’
that yer ladyship, bein’ by yer lonesome, may rather care to go to a
quieter house. An’ as A’d recommend ye to seek the ‘Walter Scott’
hotel. ’Tis kep by verra decent folk, an’ though small is verra
respectable an’ verra clean. Say that yer kent by Tammas Macpherson
an’ that will vouch for ye, seein’ that ye’re a bit lassie by yer
lanes. ’Tis a most decent place entirely, an’ A’m tellin’ ye that the
Sheriff o’ Galloway himsel’ aye rests there when he comes to the
toon.”

Joy wrote her message on the piece of paper which he had provided
whilst speaking:

“To Col. Ogilvie, Inn of Greeting, Ambleside: Dearest Daddy I have
been caught in a heavy fog and lost, but happily found my way here. I
shall return by the first train in the morning. Love to mother. I am
well and safe. Joy.”

Then the signal man gave her explicit directions as to finding the
house. As she was going away he said with a diffident anxiety:

“To what figure will yer ladyship gang in this--this meenistration?
A’d joost like to ken in case o’ neceesity?” She answered quickly:

“Oh anything you like--twenty-five dollars--I mean five pounds--ten
pounds--twenty--a hundred, anything, anything so that my father gets
the message soon.” He looked amazed for a moment. Then as he held open
the door deferentially he said in a voice in which awe blended with
respect:

“Dinna fash yerself more ma leddie. Yer message will gang for sure;
an’ gang quick. Ye may sleep easy the nicht, an’ wi’out a thocht o’
doobt. An ’ll leave wi’ ma kinsman Jamie Macpherson o’ the Walter
Scott ma neem an’ address in case yer ladyship wishes me to send to
yon the memorandum o’ the twenty poons.”

Joy found her way without much difficulty to the Walter Scott. The
house was all shut up, but she knocked and rang; and presently the
door was unchained and opened. The Boots looked for a moment doubtful
when he saw a lady alone; but when she said:

“I am lost in the fog, and Mr. Thomas Macpherson of the railway told
me I should get lodging here,” he opened the door wide and she walked
in. He chained the door, and left her for a few minutes; but returned
with a young woman who eyed her up and down somewhat suspiciously. Joy
seemed to smell danger and said at once:

“I got lost in the fog, and the motor met with an accident. So I had
to leave it on the road and walk on.”

“An’ your shawfer?” asked the doubting young woman.

“He got into trouble for driving too fast, and had to be left behind.”

“Very weel, ma’am. What name shall A put down?”

Joy’s mind had been working. Her tiredness and her sleepiness were
brushed aside by the pert young woman’s manifest suspicion. She
remembered Mr. Hardy’s caution not to give her own name; and now, face
to face with a direct query, remembered and used the one which had
been given to her on the _Cryptic_. It had this advantage that it
would put aside any suspicion or awkwardness arising from her
unprotected position, arriving as she did in such an un-accredited
way. So she answered at once:

“Athlyne. Lady Athlyne!” The young woman seemed impressed. Saying:
“Excuse me a moment” she went into the bar where she lit a candle. She
came back in a moment and said very deferentially:

“It’s ’all recht yer ladyship. There’s twa rooms, a sittin’-room an’ a
bed-room. They were originally kept for the Sheriff, but he sent word
that he was no comin’. So when the wire came frae th’ ither pairty the
rooms were kept for him. When no one arrived the name was crossed aff
the slate. But it’s a’ recht! Shall I light a fire yer Leddyship?”

“Oh no! I only require a bedroom. I must get away by the first train
in the morning. I shall just lie down as I am. If you can get me a
glass of milk and a biscuit that is all I require. If it were possible
I should like the milk hot; but if that is not convenient it won’t
matter.” As they went upstairs the girl said:

“Ye’ll forgie me yer Leddyship, but I didna ken wha ye were. Mrs.
Macpherson was early up to bed the nicht, when the fog had settled
doon and she knew there was no more traffic. To-morrow is a heavy day
here, and things keep up late; and she wanted to be ready for it. An’
she’s michty discreet aboot ony comin’ here wi’oot--wi’oot----” She
realised that she was getting into deep water and turned the
conversation. “There is yer candle lit. The fire in the kitchen is
hearty yet, an’ I’ll bring yer milk hot in the half-o’ two-twos. I’ll
leave word that ye’re to be called in good time in the morn.”

Within a few minutes she came back with the hot milk. Joy was too
tired and too anxious to eat; and refusing all proffers of service and
of help as to clothing, bade the girl good night. She just drank the
milk; and having divested herself of her shoes and stockings which
were soiled with travel and of all but her under-clothing, crept in
between the sheets. The warmth and the luxury of rest began to tell at
once; within a very few minutes she was sound asleep.




 CHAPTER XVII.
 THE SHERIFF

It was late in the afternoon when the Sheriff rode into Dalry. The
police sergeant spoke to him, and he kindly came into the station.
There the sergeant put the matter before him. He was an elderly man,
hearty and genial and with a pleasant manner which made every man his
friend. When he heard the details of the case, regarding which the
policeman asked his advice, he smiled and took snuff and said
pleasantly to the officer:

“I don’t think ye need be uneasy in your mind. After all ’tis only a
matter of a fine; and as the chauffeur is ready to pay it, whatever it
may be; and is actually in your custody having as you say more than
sufficient money upon him to pay the maximum penalty hereto inflicted
for furious driving in this shire, I think you will not get much blame
for allowing the lady to go away in the car to a ‘foreign country,’ as
you call it. I suppose sir” turning to Athlyne “you can get good bail
if required?”

“I think so” said Athlyne smiling. “I suppose a Deputy Lieutenant of
Ross Shire is good enough;” whereupon he introduced himself to the
Sheriff. They chatted together a few minutes and then, as he went to
his horse which a policeman was holding at the door, he said to the
sergeant:

“I must not, as Sheriff, be bail myself. But if any bail is required I
undertake to get it; so I think you needn’t detain his lordship any
longer. You’d better serve the summons on him for the next Session and
then everything will be in order.”

Athlyne walked down the village with him, he leading his horse. When
he knew that Athlyne was going to walk to Castle Douglas so as to be
ready to catch his train to the south he said:

“To-morrow is a busy day there and you may find it hard to get rooms
at the Douglas, especially as the fog will detain many travellers. Now
I had my rooms reserved at the Walter Scott, kept by an old servant of
mine, where I always stay. An hour gone I wired countermanding them as
I am going to stay the night with Mulgrave of Ennisfour where I am
dining; so perhaps you had better wire over and secure them. I shall
be there myself in the morning as I have work in Castle Douglas, but
that need not interfere with you. If you go early you may be off
before I get there.”

“I do not want to go South very early; so I hope you will breakfast
with me if I am still there.” The genial old Sheriff shook his head:

“No, no. You must breakfast with me. I am in my own bailiwick and you
must let me be your host.”

“All right!” said Athlyne heartily. The old man who had been looking
at him kindly all the time now said:

“Tell me now--and you won’t think me rude or inquisitive; but you’re a
young man and I’m an old one, and moreover sheriff--can I do anything
for you? The Sergeant told me you were in a state of desperate anxiety
to get away--or at any rate to let the lady get off; and I couldn’t
help noticing myself that you are still anxious. The policeman said
she was young, and much upset about it all. Can I serve you in any
way? If I can, it will I assure you be a pleasure to me.” He was so
frank and kind and hearty that Athlyne’s heart warmed to him. Moreover
he was upset himself, poor fellow; and though he was a man and a
strong one, was more than glad to unburden his heart to some one who
would be a sympathetic listener:

“The fact is, sir, that the young lady who was with me came for a
drive from Ambleside and we came on here on the spur of the moment.
Her father had gone to London and returns this evening; and as no one
knew that I--that she had gone out motoring he will be anxious about
her. Naturally neither she nor I wish to make him angry. You will
understand when I tell you that she and I are engaged to be married.
He does not know this--though” here he remembered the letter he had
posted at Ambleside “he will doubtless know soon. Unhappily he had
some mistaken idea about me. A small matter which no one here would
give a second thought to: but he is a Kentuckian and they take some
things very much to heart. This was nothing wrong--not in any way; but
all the same his taking further offence at me, as he would do if he
heard from someone else that she had been motoring with me without his
sanction, might militate against her happiness--and mine. So you can
imagine Mr. Sheriff, how grateful I am to you for your kindness.” The
sheriff paused before replying. He had been thinking--putting two and
two together: “They are engaged--but her father doesn’t know it. Then
the engagement was made only to-day. No wonder they were upset and
anxious. No wonder he drove fast. … Ah, Youth! Youth!” …

“I understand, my lord. Well, you did quite right to get the lady
away; though it was a hazardous thing for her to start off alone in
the mist.”

“It hadn’t come on then, sir. Had it been so I should never have let
her go alone--no matter what the consequences might be! But I hope
she’s out of it and close to home by this time.”

“Aye that’s so. Still she was wise to go. It avoids all possibility of
scandal. Poor bairn! I’m hoping she got off South before the fog came
on too thick. It’s drifting up from the Firth so that when once she
would have crossed the Border most like it would have been clear enow.
Anyhow under the circumstances you are right to stay here. Then there
can be no talk whatever. And her father will have had time to cool
down by the time ye meet.

“We’re parting here, my Lord. Good-bye and let me wish ye both every
form of human happiness. Perhaps by morn you will have had some news;
and I’m hoping ye’ll be able to tell me of her safe arrival.”

At the cross roads the men parted. The Sheriff rode on his way to
Ennisfour, and Athlyne went back to Dalry. He ordered his dinner, and
then went out to send a telegram at the little post office. His
telegram ran:


To Walter Scott Hotel Castle Douglas

Keep rooms given up by Sheriff for to-night.

                                        Athlyne.


He had written the telegram through without a pause. The signature was
added unhesitatingly, though not merely instinctively. He had done
with falsity; henceforth he would use his own name, and that only. He
felt freer than he had done for many a day.

He ate his dinner quietly; he was astonished at himself that he could
take matters so calmly. It was really that he now realised that he had
done all he could. There was nothing left but to wait. In the earlier
part of that waiting he was disturbed and anxious. Difficulties and
dangers and all possible matters of concern obtruded themselves upon
his thought in endless succession. But as time wore on the natural
optimism of his character began to govern his thinking. Reason still
worked freely enough, but she took her orders from the optimistic side
and brought up arrays of comforting facts and deductions.

It was with renewed heart and with a hopeful spirit that he set out on
his road to Castle Douglas. He had deliberately chosen to walk instead
of taking a carriage or riding. He did not want to arrive early in the
evening, and he calculated that the sixteen miles would take him
somewhere about four hours to walk. The exercise would, whilst it
killed the time which he had to get through, give him if not ease of
mind at least some form of mental distraction. Such, he felt, must be
his present anodyne--his guarantee of sanity. As he had no luggage of
any kind he felt perfectly free; the only addition to his equipment
was a handful of cigars to last him during the long walk.

He had left Dalry some miles behind him when he began to notice the
thickening of the mist. After a while when this became only too
apparent he began to hesitate as to whether it would not be wiser to
return. By this time he realised that it was no mere passing cloud of
vapour which was driving up from the south, but a sea fog led inward
through the narrowing Firth; he could smell the iodine of the sea in
his nostrils. But he decided to go on his way. He remembered fairly
well the road which he had traversed earlier in the day. Though a
rough road and somewhat serpentine as it followed the windings of the
Ken and the Dee, it was so far easy to follow that there were no
bifurcations and few cross-roads. And so with resolute heart--for
there was something to overcome here--and difficulty meant to him
distraction from pain--he pushed on into the growing obscurity of the
fog.

On the high ground above Shirmers he felt the wind driving more keenly
in his face; but he did not pause. He trudged on hopefully; every step
he took was bringing him closer to England--and to Joy. Now it was
that he felt the value of the stout walking cudgel that he had
purchased from a passing drover. For in the fog he was like a blind
man; sight needed the friendly aid of touch.

But it was dreadfully slow work, and at the end of a few hours he was
wearied out with the overwhelming sense of impotence and the ceaseless
struggling with the tiniest details of hampered movement. Being on
foot and of slow progress he had one advantage over travelling on
horseback or in a vehicle: he was able to take advantage of every
chance opportunity of enlightenment. From passing pedestrians and at
wayside cottages he gathered directions for his guidance. It was
midnight--the town clock was striking--when he entered Castle Douglas
and began to inquire his way to the Walter Scott hotel.

After repeated knocking the door was opened by the Boots--a heavy,
thick-headed, sleepy, tousled man, surly and grudging of speech.
Athlyne pushed past him into the hall way and said:

“I wired here in the afternoon to have kept for me the Sheriff’s
rooms. Did my telegram arrive.”

“Aye. It kem a’recht. But that was all that kem. Ye was expectit, an’
the missis kep the rooms for ye till late; but when ye didna come she
gied ye up an’ let anither pairty that was lost i’ the fog hae the
bedroom. All that’s left is the parlour, an that we can hae an ye
will. Forbye that ye’ll hae to sleep on the sofy. A’m thinkin’ it’s
weel it’s o’er long than ordinair’, for ye’re no a ween yersel. Bide
wheer y’ are, an’ A’ll fetch ye a rug or two an’ a cushion. Ye maun
put up wi’ them the nicht for ye’ll git nane ither here.” He left him
standing in the dark; and shuffled away down a dim stairway, to the
basement.

In a few minutes he re-appeared with a bundle of rugs and pillows
under his arm; in his hand was a bottle of whiskey, with the drawn
cork partly re-inserted. With the deftness of an accomplished servitor
he carried in his other hand, together with the candle, a pitcher of
water and a tumbler. As he went up the staircase he said in a whisper:

“Man, walk saft as ye gang; an’ dinna cough nor sneeze or mak’ a soond
in the room or ye’ll maybe waken th’ ither body. Joost gang like a man
at a carryin’. An’ mind ye dinna snore! Lie ye like a bairn! What time
shall A ca’ ye?”

“I want to catch the morning train for the south.”

“That’ll be a’recht. A’ll ca’ ye braw an’ airly!”

“Good night!” said Athlyne as he softly closed the door.

He spread one rug on the sofa, which supplemented by a chair, was of
sufficient length; put the other ready to cover himself, and fixed the
cushions. Having stripped to his flannels he blew out the candle, and,
without making a sound, turned in. He was wearied in mind and nerve
and body, and the ease of lying down acted like a powerful narcotic.
Within a minute he was sound asleep.




 CHAPTER XVIII.
 PURSUIT

Colonel Ogilvie found his wife in excellent health and spirits. The
cure had been effective, and the prospect of meeting Joy so filled her
with delight that her youth seemed to be renewed. He could see, when
the morning light was admitted to their bedroom, that her eyes were
bright and her cheeks rosy; and all her movements were alert and
springy. Judy too, when they went to breakfast, looked well and was in
good spirits; but there was something about her which he could not
understand. It was not that she was quick of intellect and speech, for
such had been always her habit; it was not that she was eager, for she
was not always so; it was not that she was exuberantly fond of
Joy--she had never been anything else. But there seemed now to be some
sort of elusive background to all her thoughts. He began to wonder in
a vague way if it were possible that she had fallen in love. She
asked, after her usual manner, a host of questions about Joy and about
the visit to the Lakes; where they had been and who they had seen; and
of all the little interests and happenings during the time of
separation. Colonel Ogilvie felt a little wearied of it all. He had
already covered the ground with the girl’s mother, for arriving in the
grey of the dawn, he had gone straight to his wife’s room where he had
rested till breakfast time. There he had told her all that he could
remember. With, however, the patient courtesy which had not as yet in
his life failed him with women he went over all the ground again with
Judy. He could not but be struck with Judy’s questioning on one
subject: whether they had met at Ambleside any special acquaintance.
He concluded that she meant Mr. Hardy, and asked her if such were the
case. She blushed so brightly when she admitted it that he conceived
the idea that the peccant Englishman was the object of her affection.
Then, as she dropped that subject of questioning, he, in order to draw
her out, went on:

“But my dear Judy it was not possible that we could have seen him. He
has not seemed particularly anxious to meet us; and even if he was
anxious he could not have done it as he did not know where we were.”

“Oh, yes he did!” The Colonel was surprised; the tone of her words
carried conviction of truthfulness. He answered quickly:

“He did! How on earth do you know that?” Judy in her emotional
interest answered without thinking.

“Because I told him so!”

“Oh, you saw him then?” Again she answered without thought:

“No, but I wrote to him.”

“How do you know that he got your letter?”

“Because he answered it!” She would have given all she possessed to
have been silent or to have answered more discreetly when she saw her
brother-in-law’s face wrinkle into a hard smile, and noted the cruel
keenness of his eyes and the cynical smile on his mouth. She answered
sharply; and, as is usual, began the instant after, to pay the penalty
for such sharpness. His voice seemed to rasp her very soul as he said:

“I am glad to hear that the gentleman has consideration for some
one--even a lady--who writes to him. But to my mind such but
emphasises his rudeness--if for the moment I may call it so--of his
conduct to others. As for myself when I meet the gentleman--should I
ever have the good fortune to do so--I shall require him to answer for
this insult--amongst others!”

“Insult?” murmured Judy in a panic of apprehension.

“Yes, my dear Judith. There is no stronger word; had there been I
should have used it. When the same man who does _not_ answer my
letters, or write even to accept or decline my proffered hospitality
carries on at the same time a clandestine correspondence with ladies
of my family he shall have to answer to me for it. By God he shall!”
Judy thought silence wiser than any form of words, and remained mute.
Colonel Ogilvie went on in the same cold, rasping voice:

“May I ask you, Miss Hayes,”--“Miss Hayes, my God!” thought poor Judy
trembling. He went on: “if my daughter has had any meeting or
correspondence with him?”

“No! No! No!” cried Judy. “I can answer for that.”

“Indeed! May I ask how you can speak with certainty on such a subject.
I thought you were in Italy and that my daughter had been with me.” In
despair she spoke impulsively:

“I don’t _know_, Lucius. How could I--I only think so.”

“Exactly! Then you are but giving your opinion! For that my dear
Judith I am much obliged; but it has been for so long my habit to
judge for myself in matters of those mutual relations between men
which we call ‘honour’ that I have somehow come to trust my own
opinion in preference to that of any one else--even you my dear
Judith--and to act upon it.” Then, seeing the red flush of anger and
humiliation in her cheeks whilst the tears seemed to leap into her
eyes, he felt that he had gone too far and added:

“I trust that you will forgive me, my dear sister, if I have caused
you unnecessary pain. Unhappily pain must follow such dereliction of
duty as has been shown by that young man, and by you too; but believe
me I would spare you if I could. But I can promise--and do so
now--that I shall not again forget myself and speak bitterly, out of
the bitterness of my heart as I have done. I pray your forgiveness,
and trust that it may be extended to me.” The cynical words and tone
of his apology, however it may have been meant, only added fuel to her
anger. Words were inadequate, so she sought refuge in flight. As she
went out of the door she heard Colonel Ogilvie say as if to himself:

“I may not know how to speak to women; but thank God, I do know how to
deal with that damned fellow!”

Judy threw herself on her bed in a storm of futile passion. She could
not but feel that she had been brutally treated; but she was powerless
to either resent or explain. But well she knew that she had helped to
leave matters worse for poor Joy than they had been. All the anger
that Colonel Ogilvie had been repressing had now blazed out. He had
expressed himself, and she had never known such expression of his to
fail in tragic consequences. He would now never forgive Mr. Hardy for
his double sins of omissions and commission. She was sorry for the
young man’s sake; but was in anguish for the sake of the poor girl who
had, she felt and knew, set her heart upon him. Joy’s romance in which
her heart--her whole being and her future happiness--had been embarked
was practically over, though she did not know it as yet. All the
life-long brightness that even her father had ever hoped for her was
gone. Henceforth she would be only a poor derelict, like Judy herself,
wrecked on a lee shore! Judy had always pitied herself, but she had
never realized the cause of that pity as she did now, seen as it was
through the eyes of loving sympathy.

  “I pitied my own heart,
  As if I held it in my hand,
  Somewhat coldly,--with a sense
  Of fulfilled benevolence,
  And a ‘Poor thing’ negligence.”

Colonel Ogilvie went out in a very militant humour to interview the
motor-agent. He felt angry with himself for having lost his
temper--and to a lady; and his anger had to be visited on some one. In
any case he considered that the motor people had treated him scurvily
and should suffer accordingly. In reality he was in a reaction from
great happiness. He was an affectionate husband who had been deeply
concerned at his wife’s long illness, and lonely and distraught in her
long absence. Only that morning he had met her again and had found her
quite restored to health and as though she had regained her youth. He
had shared in her pleasure at the good account he had to give of Joy.
It was, after all, perhaps natural to a man of his peculiar
temperament to visit heavily his displeasure on the man who had, to
his mind, ill-used him, and on all concerned with him in the doing.
Mr. Hardy it was who had jarred the wheels of his chariot of pleasure;
and Mr. Hardy it was who must ultimately answer to him for so doing.

The expression of his opinions as to the moral and commercial worth of
the motor-agent and of the manufacturer with whom he dealt seemed to
relieve his feelings to some degree; he returned to Brown’s in a much
milder frame of mind than that in which he had gone out. He was kept
pretty busy till the time of departure, but in his secret heart--made
up to action during the time of his work--he determined to try to make
amends to Judy for the pain he had given her. He rejoiced now that his
wife had not been present at that scene which it already pained him to
look back upon.

He was somewhat incensed that as he could not leave by his intended
train he would have to postpone the journey by several hours. He could
not now arrive at Ambleside till nearly midnight.

In the train he took the first opportunity of making the _amende_ to
Judy. Mrs. Ogilvie had fallen asleep--she had been awake since very
early in the morning, so the Colonel said quietly to his
sister-in-law:

“Judy I want you to forgive me, if you can.” She thrilled with
pleasure as he spoke her name in the familiar form. It seemed some
sort of presage of a change for the better, a sort of lifting of the
ban which had all day lain so heavy on her. As he went on her hopes
grew; there were possibilities that, after all, Joy was not yet
finally doomed to unhappiness. At all times Colonel Ogilvie was
impressive in his manner; the old-fashioned courtesy on which he had
long ago founded himself was permeated with conscious self-esteem. Now
when the real earnestness of the moment was grafted upon this
pronounced manner he seemed to the last degree dignified--almost
pompous:

“I cannot tell you how sorry I am that I caused you pain this morning,
or how ashamed I am for having so lost my temper before you. For more
than twenty years I have honestly tried, my dear, to make you happy.”
Here she interrupted him: “And you succeeded Lucius!” He rose and
bowed gravely:

“Thank you, my dear. I am grateful to you for that kindly expression.
It does much, I assure you, to mitigate the poignancy of my present
concern. It was too bad of me to let my bitterness so wound you. It
shall not occur again. Moreover I feel that I owe you something; and I
promise you that if I should be so--so overcome again by anger I shall
try to obey you to the best of my power. You shall tell me what you
wish me to do; and if I can I shall try to do it.” Here a look of
caution, rare to him, overspread his face: “I won’t promise to give up
a purpose of my life or brook any interference with the course of
honour--that I can promise to no one, not even to you my dear. But if
I can grant any consideration--or--or favour I shall certainly try to
do so!”

Judy was not so well satisfied with the end of the promise as with the
beginning. But it was hopeful of better things for the future; so she
meekly and gratefully accepted it _en bloc_.

When they arrived at Ambleside it was dark and the lamps of the
station lent but a dim light. It became evident to Mrs. Ogilvie and
Judy that Colonel Ogilvie was disappointed at not finding Joy awaiting
them on the platform. He had, during the journey, explained to them
with some elaboration that they were not to expect her as he had said
there was no need of her coming; but, all the same, he had himself
expected her. As the train drew up he had leaned out of the window
looking carefully along the whole range of the platform. When,
however, he ascertained that she was not there, he turned his
attention to Judy whom he observed prolonging the search. His mind at
once went back to his original concern that there was something
between her and Mr. Hardy. She heard him say to himself fiercely under
his breath:

“That damned fellow again!” She did not of course understand that it
was with reference to herself, and took it that it presaged ill to
Joy. She knew from Colonel Ogilvie’s expression and bearing that the
man he had now grown to hate was in his mind, and with a heavy heart
she took her place in the waiting landau.

When the carriage arrived at the hotel Colonel Ogilvie jumped out and
ran up the steps. This was so unlike his usual courtesy that it not
only pained the two ladies but made them anxious. When Colonel Ogilvie
forgot his habitual deference to women something serious indeed must
have been in his mind! When they followed, which they did as quickly
as they could, they found him in the hall reading a telegram. A
railway envelope lay on the table, and beside it a little pile of
letters. When he had finished reading the first telegram he opened the
second and read it also. All the time his face was set in a grim
frown, the only relief from which was the wrinkling of his forehead
which betrayed an added anxiety. He handed the two transcripts to his
wife, saying as he did so:

“I have put them in order; one is a few hours earlier than the other!”
Mrs. Ogilvie read in silence and handed the forms to Judy, the Colonel
remaining grimly silent. Mrs. Ogilvie said nothing. When Judy had
turned over the last and looked at the back of it in that helpless
manner which betrays inadequate knowledge, Colonel Ogilvie said:

“Well?”

“I trust the poor child is not in any danger!” said the mother.

“How thoughtful of her to have sent twice. She knew you would be so
anxious about her!” said the aunt, wishing to propitiate the angry
father. For fully a minute no more was said. Then the Colonel spoke:

“She went motoring. In whose car? I have not yet got my own!” As he
was speaking the hotel proprietor came into the hall to pay his
respects, as he usually did with incoming guests. He heard the last
remark and said:

“Pardon me, Colonel Ogilvie. But your car has arrived. The chauffeur
who had charge of it and came in the same train with it to Kirkby
Stephen drove it here some time ago!” Colonel Ogilvie bowed a slight
acknowledgment and turning to Judy said:

“Then it could not be in that car she went. If not, whose car was it?
Whom did she go with? We know no one here who owns a car; and we did
not make any new acquaintances during our stay. Indeed none even of
our old acquaintances did us the honour of calling. But perhaps my
dear Judy,” he spoke with manifest and comforting self-restraint--“you
can enlighten us. Do you know if your friend Mr. Hardy whom you
informed of our being here has a motor car?” Judy feared to
precipitate disaster, and not knowing what to say answered feebly with
a query:

“Why Colonel?” The storm cloud of the father’s wrath instantly broke:

“Why, madam ‘why’!” he almost roared whilst the discreet proprietor
withdrew closing the inner door of the hall behind him--the luggage
was being taken in by the basement door:

“I’ll tell you why if you wish--though perhaps you know it already.
Because I want to know under what circumstances my daughter has gone
out motoring with some stranger--though indeed it may be that he is
not quite a stranger--the moment my back was turned. Let me tell you
that it is not usual for unmarried young ladies to go out motoring
into far away places with men, unchaperoned. My honour--_my_ honour
through my daughter--is here concerned. And it is like that damned
fellow to take her away in such an underhand manner. You need say
nothing of him. It’s no use trying to palliate his conduct. True
enough I don’t know for certain that it is he, or that she is alone
with any man; but I have a conviction that it is so; and I tell you I
shall lose no time in putting my convictions to the test. I mean to
take no chances with regard to that damned fellow. I don’t trust him!
He has already affronted me, and has been tampering with the women of
my family. I have borne even that with what temper I could because I
was under obligation to him. But if, as it would seem, he has run away
with my daughter, I shall brook his insolence no longer. He shall
render me a full account of his doings with me and mine!” He crammed
his letters into his pocket and strode upstairs. There he rang the
bell in such a violent manner that the proprietor himself attended to
it. Colonel Ogilvie asked him to have the chauffeur sent up to him,
and requested the proprietor to come also himself as he wished to ask
him some questions on local matters. He had by now his temper in hand,
and was all the more dangerous because cold. In a few minutes the
proprietor brought in the chauffeur, a stolid, hard-featured, silent
man; manifestly one to obey orders and to stand any amount of fatigue.
When Colonel Ogilvie had looked at his credentials and asked him some
questions, all of which he did with perfect self-control and courtesy,
he turned to the proprietor and asked:

“Can you tell me whereabout is a place called Castle Douglas?”

“In Scotland, Colonel. In Galloway--the part of Scotland just beyond
the Firth of Solway. It is I think in Kirkcudbrightshire.”

“How far from here?”

“Something over a hundred miles I should say.” The father started:

“Good God!” Judy’s heart sank at the exclamation and the tone; his
voice was laden with horror and despair. The new chauffeur’s mouth
opened. He spoke as if every word was grudgingly shot out:

“It is exactly ninety-one and a half miles.” Colonel Ogilvie turned to
him quickly:

“How do you know so accurately; have you driven it?”

“Never sir!”

“Then how do you know?”

“In the train coming down I spent my time looking over the maps and
the distance as given in the books of the Motorists’ Touring Club. I
noted that.”

“Had you any reason for examining that particular route?” asked the
Colonel suspiciously. He was obsessed by an idea that the “damned
fellow” was corrupting everybody so as to work against him, Colonel
Ogilvie.

“None special; I was only trying to do my business well. I thought it
likely that you might want me to stay with you a short time until you
and your permanent chauffeur should become acquainted with the
mechanism of your new car. You see, I was told you were an American,
and the American makes differ somewhat from our own. And as I am
myself looking out for a permanent situation where I should be well
paid, made comfortable, and treated with whatever consideration is due
to a first-rate _mechanicien_ and driver I thought that if I showed
zeal in your temporary service you might wish to retain me
permanently. In a certain sense I took, I may say, special note of at
least part of that particular route.”

“Why?” Colonel Ogilvie’s suspicions came up afresh at the admission.

“Simply because I took it that you might want to drive into Scotland,
and Galloway is perhaps the most promising region for motoring on this
side of that country. All the motor roads from this side of England
run through Carlisle. Then you cross the Border close to Gretna Green.
…”

“To where?” The Colonel’s voice was full of passion. The chauffeur
went on calmly and explicitly:

“Gretna Green. That is where run-away marriages used to be made. That
place was usually chosen because it was the first across the Border
where Scotch law ruled. The simplifying of our marriage laws and the
growth of sanity amongst parents of marriageable daughters generally
has done away with the necessity of elopement. Now we go by there
without stopping, as Galloway is the modern objective. Indeed in going
there you do not go into Gretna at all; you pass it by on the right
when you have crossed the bridge over the Sark and are making for
Annan. And as to my knowledge of mileages that is a part of my trade.
It is my business to arrange for the amount of petrol necessary for
the run I am ordered to make. I don’t think that you need disturb
yourself about that one small item of my knowledge. It may set you
more at ease if I tell you that it is one hundred and thirty-six and a
half miles to Glasgow; a hundred and one to Abbotsford; seventy-five
and a half to Dumfries; a hundred and thirty-five and a half to
Edinburgh; two hundred and seventy-four and a half to Aberdeen; one
hundred and fifty-eight and three quarters to. …”

“Stop! stop!” cried Colonel Ogilvie. “I am obliged to you for your
zeal in my service; and I think I can promise you that if in every way
you suit, you may look on the permanent post as your own. I shall want
you to begin your duties this very night. But this is a special job;
and with special reward, for it is difficult and arduous.”

“I am willing sir, whatever it may be.”

“That is well said. You are the sort of man I want.”

“My orders sir?”

“I want you to take me to Castle Douglas to-night--now--as soon as you
can get ready. I wish to get there as soon as I can. You will want to
have everything right, for we must have no break-down if we can help
it. And you must have good lamps.”

“’Twill be all right, sir. We shan’t, I expect, break down. But if we
do--the motor is a new one and I did not make it--_I_ shall put it
right. I am a first-rate _mechanicien_ and an accomplished driver.
…”

“All right; but don’t talk. Get the car ready, and we shall start at
once.”

“We can start at once, so far as the car and I are concerned. But we
lack something as yet. We must have a pilot.”

“A pilot! I thought you knew the way.”

“On paper, yes; and I doubt not I could get there all right--in time.
But you want to go quick; and we would lose time finding out the way.
Remember we are going in the dark.” Then turning to the proprietor he
said:

“Perhaps you can help us here, sir. Have you any one who can pilot?”

“Not a chauffeur; but I have a coachman who knows all round here for a
couple of days’ journey. I have no doubt that he knows that road
amongst the others. He could sit beside you and direct you how to go!”

“Right! Can you get him soon?”

“At once. He lives over the stables. I shall send for him now.” He
rang the bell and when the servant came gave his message. And so that
matter was settled and the journey arranged. The chauffeur went to
have a last look over the motor car, and to bring it round to the
door.

All the time of the interview Colonel Ogilvie stood silent, keeping
erect and rigid. He was so stern and so master of himself that Judy
wished now that he had less self-control. She feared the new phase
even more than the old. Then care for what had still to be done took
hold of her. She took her sister away to prepare a little basket of
food and wine for Colonel Ogilvie and the men with him; they would
need some sustenance on their long, arduous journey. Those kindly
offices kept both women busy whilst Colonel Ogilvie was putting on
warm clothes for the night travelling. Presently Mrs. Ogilvie joined
him. When they were alone she said to him somewhat timidly:

“You will be tender, dear, with Joy? The child is young, and a harsh
word spoken in anger at a time when she is high-strung and nervous and
tired and frightened might be a lasting sorrow to her!” She half
expected that he would resent her speaking at all. She was surprised
as well as pleased when, putting his hands kindly on her shoulders, he
said:

“Be quite easy in your mind on that subject, wife. Joy has all my
love; and, whatever comes, I shall use no harsh word to her. I love
her too well to give her pain, at the moment or to think of
afterwards. She shall have nothing but care and tenderness and such
words as you would yourself wish spoken!” The mother was comforted for
the moment. But then came a thought, born of her womanhood, that the
keenest pain which could be for the woman would be through her concern
for the man. She had little doubt as to what her husband’s action
would be if his surmises as to Mr. Hardy should prove to be correct.
And such would mean the blighting of poor Joy’s life. She would dearly
have loved to remonstrate with her husband on the subject; and she
would have done so, whatever might have been the consequences to
herself, but that she feared that any ill-timed expostulation might be
harmful to her daughter. All the motherhood in her was awake, and
nerved her to endure in silence. The only other words she said as she
kissed her husband were:

“Good-bye for a while, dear. God keep you in all dangers of the
road--and--and in all the far greater dangers that may come to you at
the end of it. My love to Joy! Be good to her, and never forget that
she can suffer most through any one dear to her. Bring her home to me,
safe and--and happy! I …” Her voice broke and she wept on his
shoulder. Colonel Ogilvie was a determined man, and in some ways a
harsh and cruel one; but he was a man, and understood. He took his
wife in his arms and kissed her fondly, stroking her dark hair wherein
the silver threads were showing. Then he passed out in silence.

By the door of the car he found Judy who said:

“I have put in your supper--you will want it dear--and also supper for
the men. And oh! Lucius, don’t forget, for poor Joy’s sake, that this
day you hold her heart--which is her life--in your hand!”

This added responsibility filled the cup of Colonel Ogilvie’s
indignation. Already his conscience was quickening and his
troubles--the agitation to his feelings--were almost more than he
could bear. He would have liked to make some cynical remark to Judy;
but before he could think of anything sufficiently biting, the motor
which had been throbbing violently started.

Before the angry man could attempt to get back his self-possession he
was gazing past the two shrouded figures before him and across the
luminous arc of the lamps out into the night. The darkness seemed to
sweep by him as he rushed on his way to Scotland.

When he had gone Judy turned to her sister and said: “I was going to
give him Joy’s dressing bag and a change of dress to take with him.
She will want them, poor dear, after a long day of travel and a night
in a strange place. But I have thought of a better plan.”

“And that?” asked the anxious mother.

“To take them myself! Moreover it won’t be any harm my being present
in case the Colonel gets on the rampage. It will restrain him some.
Now you go and lie down, dear. Don’t say anything--except your
prayers--in case you feel you must say something. But sleep will be
your best help in this pretty tough proposition. I’ll go and get a
hustle on that Dutch landlord. He’s got to find an automobile and a
chauffeur, and a pilot if necessary, for me too!”




 CHAPTER XIX.
 DECLARATION OF WAR

Joy Ogilvie was so tired out that her body lay like a log all night.
How her mind was occupied she only knew afterwards. For the memory of
dreams is an unconscious memory at the time; it is only when there is
opportunity of comparison with actualities that dreams can be
re-produced. Then, as at first, the dreams are real--as they are
forever whilst memory lasts. Indeed regarding dreams and actualities,
one might almost appeal to scientific analogy; and in comparing the
world of imagination--which is the kingdom of dreams--with the
material world, might adduce the utterance of Sir Oliver Lodge in
comparing the density of aether with that of matter in the modern
scientific view: “Matter is turning out to be a filmy thing in
comparison with aether.”

This might well serve as a scientific comparison. Nay more, it might
well be an induction. The analogies of nature are so marvellously
constant, as exemplified by the higher discoveries in physics, that we
might easily wander farther than in taking the inner world of Thought
as compared with the outer world of Physical Being, as an analogy to
the Seen and Unseen worlds.

In the meantime we may take it that Joy’s dreams that night were in
some way reflective of the events of the day. No girl of healthy
emotional power could fail to be influenced by such a sequence of
experiences of passion and fear as she had gone through. The realized
hoping of love, the quick-answering abandonment of expressed passion;
long, long minutes of the bliss of communion with that other
soul--minutes whose sweetness or whose length could not be computed
until the leisure of thought gave opportunity. Unconscious cerebration
goes on unceasingly; and be sure that with such data as she had in her
mind, the workings of imagination were quick and by no means cold.
Again she lived the moments of responsive passion; but so lived them
that she had advanced further on the road to completed passion when
the unconsciousness to physical surroundings began to disappear and on
the senses the actualities began to consciously impress themselves.
The dawn, stealing in between the chinks of the folded shutters, made
strange lines on the floor without piercing through the walls of
sleep. The myriad sounds of waking life from distant field and
surrounding street brought no message to the closed eyes of weariness.
The sun rose, and rose, and rose; and still she lay there unmoving.

At last that unaccountable impulse which moves all living things to
sentience at the ending of sleep, stirred her. The waking grew on her.
At first, when her eyes partially opened, she saw, but without
comprehending, the dim room with its low ceiling; the wide window,
masked in with shutters whose edges were brilliant with the early
light; the odd furniture and all the unfamiliar surroundings. Then
came the inevitable self-question: “where am I?”

The realization of waking from such dreaming as hers is a rude and
jarring process, and when it does come, comes with something of a
shock. For what seemed a long time Joy lay in a sort of languorous
ecstasy whilst memory brought back to her those moments of the
previous day which were sweeter even than her dreams. Again she heard
the footsteps of the man she loved coming up rapidly behind her. Again
she saw as she turned, in obedience to some new impulse which swayed
her to surrender, the face of the man looking radiant with love and
happiness. Again she felt the sweet satisfaction of living and loving
when his arms closed round her and her arms closed round him and they
strained each other strictly. Again there came to her the thrill which
seemed to lift her from her earthly being as his mouth touched hers
and they kissed each other in the absolute self-abandonment of
reciprocated passion--the very passing memory of which set her blood
tingling afresh; the thrill which set her soul floating in the expanse
of air and made all conventions of the artificial world seen far below
seem small and miserable and of neither power nor import. Again she
was swept by that tide of wild desires, vague and nebulous as yet,
inchoate, elusive, expansive, all-absorbing, which proclaimed her
womanhood to herself. That desire of wife to husband, of sex to sex,
of woman to man, which is the final expression of humanity--the love
song of the children of Adam. It was as though memory and dreaming had
become one. As if the day had merged in the night, and the night again
in the coming day; each getting as it came all the thoughts and wishes
and fancies and desires which follow in the train of the
all-conquering Love-God.

In such receptive mood Joy awoke to life. When she realized where she
was; and when the import of her new surroundings had broken in upon
her, all the forces of her youth and strength began at once to
manifest themselves. She slid softly from her bed--the instinct of
self protection forbade noise or else she would have jumped to the
floor. Doing must follow dreaming! The attitude of standing, once
again helped to recall the previous evening, and she remembered that
she had thought then that she must not open the windows in the morning
because they faced directly other windows across a narrow street.

She remembered also that the next room, through which she had entered,
had windows on two sides. Those on one side opened as did her own; but
those on the other side looked out on an open space. And so, without
further thought, she opened the door between and passed into the outer
room. It too, like her own, was dark from the closed shutters.
Instinctively she went softly, her bare feet making no sound on the
carpet. With the same instinctive caution she had opened the door
noiselessly; when the self-protective instinct has once been awakened,
it does not easily relapse to sleep. She went over to one of the
windows and tried to look out through the chinks. The day was bright
outside and the sun was shining; the fog had entirely disappeared. In
the sudden desire to breathe the fresh morning air, and to free in the
sunlight her soul cramped by the long darkness of fog and night, she
threw open the heavy shutters.


Athlyne slept so soundly that he never stirred. He lay on the sofa on
his left side with his face out to the room. He too had been dreaming;
and to his dreams the happiness of the day had brought a vivifying
light. Through all his weariness of mind and body came to his spirit
the glow of those moments when he knew that his love was reciprocated;
when his call to his mate had been answered--answered in no uncertain
voice. And so he, too, had lain with bodily nature all quiescent,
whilst the emotional side of his mind ranged freely between memory and
expectation. And in due process the imaginative power of the mind had
worked on the nerves--and through them on the body--till he too lay in
a languorous semi-trance--the mind ranging free whilst the abnormally
receptive body quivered in unison. It was a dangerous condition of
being in which to face the situation which awaited him.

The sound of the opening shutter wakened him, fully and all at once.
The moment his eyes opened he saw a figure between him and the window;
and at the knowledge that some stranger was in his room the habit of
quick action which had prevailed in his years of campaigning
re-asserted itself. On the instant he flung aside his blanket and
sprang from his bed.

At the sound of a step on the floor Joy turned. The light streaming in
through the unshuttered window showed them in completeness each to the
other. The light struck Athlyne full in front. There was instant
recognition, even in the unaccustomed garb, of that tall lithe form;
of those fine aquiline features, of those dark flashing eyes. As to
Joy, who standing against the light made her own shadow, Athlyne could
have no doubt. He would have realized her presence in darkness and
silence. As she stood in her fine linen, the morning light making a
sort of nimbus round the opacity of the upper part of her body, she
looked to him like some fresh realization--some continuation in
semi-ethereal form--of the being of his dreams. There was no pause for
thought in either of the lovers. The instant of recognition was the
realization of presence--unquestioning and the most natural thing in
the world that the other should be there. Delight had sealed from
within the ears of Doubt. Unhesitatingly they ran to each other, and
before a second had passed were locked tightly in each other’s arms.

In the secret belief of the Conventional world--that belief which is
the official teaching of the churches of an artificial society, and
not merely the world of Adam and Eve (and some others)--the ceremony
of Marriage in itself changes the entire nature of the contracting
parties. Whatever may have been the idiosyncrasies of these
individuals such are forthwith changed, foregone, or otherwise altered
to suit that common denominator of Human Nature which alone is
officially catalogued in the records of the Just. It were as though
the recorded promise of two love-stricken sufferers, followed by the
formal blessings of the Church in any of its differentiations--or of
the Registrar--should change baser mortals to more angelic
counterpart; just as the “Philosopher’s Stone” which the mediaeval
alchemist dreamed of and sought for, was expected to change baser
metals to gold.

Perhaps it is because this transmutation is so complete that so many
of those marriages which the Church does sanctify turn out so
differently from the anticipations of the contractors and blessors!

But Dame Nature has her own church and her own ritual. In her case the
Blessing comes before the Service; and the Benediction is but the
official recognition that two souls--with their attendant bodies--have
found a perfect communion for themselves. Those who believe in Human
Nature--and many of them are seriously minded people too--realize and
are thankful for the goodness of God who showers the possibilities of
happiness with no stinting and no uncertain hand. “After all” they say
“what about Eden?” There was no church’s blessing there--not even a
Registrar; and yet we hold that Adam and Eve were united in Matrimony.
Nor were their children or their children’s children made one with
organized formality. What was it then that on these occasions stood
between fornication and marriage? What could it be but the Blessing of
God! And if God could make marriage by His Blessing in Eden, when did
He forego that power. Or if indeed there be only a “Civil
Contract”--as so many hold to-day--what proofs or writings must there
be beyond that mere “parole” contract which is recognized in other
matters by the Law of the Land.

So, the believers in natural religion and natural law--those who do
not hold that personal licence, unchecked and boundless, is an
appanage or logical result of freedom. To these, freedom is in itself
a state bounded on all sides by restrictive laws--as must ever be,
unless Anarchy is held to be the ultimate and controlling force. And
in the end Anarchy is the denial of all Cosmic law--that systematised
congeries of natural forces working in harmony to a common end.

But law, Cosmic or Anarchic, (if there be such a thing, and it may be
that Hell--if there is one--has its own laws--) or any grade between
these opposites, is a matter for coolness and reflection. _Inter arma
silent leges_ is a maxim of co-ordinate rulings in the Court of Cosmic
law. And the principle holds whether the arms be opposed or locked
together in any form of passion. When Love lifts the souls, whose
bodies are already in earthly communion, Law ceases to be. From the
altitude of accomplished serenity the mightiest law is puny; just as
from a balloon the earth looks flat, and even steeples and towers have
no perspective.

So it was with the two young people clasped in each other’s arms. The
world they lived in at the moment was _their_ world, bounded only by
the compass of their arms. After all what more did they want--what
could they want. They were together and alone. Shame was not for them,
or to them, who loved with all their hearts--whose souls already felt
as one. For shame, which is a conventional ordering of the blood, has
no place--not even a servitor’s--in the House of Love: that palace
where reigns the love of husbandhood and wifehood, of fatherhood and
motherhood--that true, realized Cosmos--the aim, the objective, the
heaven of human life.

Their circumstances but intensified the pleasure of the embrace.
Athlyne and Joy had both felt the same communion of spirits when they
embraced at their first meeting out of Ambleside when their souls had
met. This had been intensified when they sat in close embrace after
lunch beyond Dalry, when heart consciously beat to heart. Now it was
completed in this meeting, unexpected and therefore more free and
unhampered by preparatory thoughts and intentions, when body met body
in a close if tentative communion. The mere paucity of raiment had
force and purpose. They could each feel as they hung together closely
strained, the beating of each other’s heart; the rising and falling of
each other’s lungs. Their breaths commingled as they held mouth to
mouth. In such delirious rapture--for these two ardent young people
loved each other with a love which both held to be but the very
beginning of an eternal bond and which took in every phase, actual and
possible, of human beings--there was no place for forethought or
afterthought. It was the hour of life which is under the guidance of
Nature; to be looked forward to with keen if ignorant anticipation;
and which is to be looked back on for evermore as a time when the very
heavens opened and the singing of the Angelic choir came through
unmuffled.

For seconds, in which Time seemed to stand still, they stood body to
body and mouth to mouth. The first to speak was the man:

“I thought you were in England by late in the evening--and you were
there all the time!” He indicated the direction by turning his eyes
towards her room. His words seemed to fire her afresh. Holding him
more closely to her, she leaned back from her hips and gazed at him
languorously; her words dropped slowly from her opened lips:

“Oh-h! If we had only known!” What exactly was in her mind she did not
know--did not think of knowing--did not want to know. Perhaps she did
not mean anything definite. It was only an expression of some feeling,
of some want, some emotion, some longing--some primitive utterance
couched in words of educated thought, as sweet and spontaneous as the
singing of a bird in its native woods at springtime.

Somehow, it moved Athlyne strangely. Moved the manhood of him in many
ways, chiefest among them his duty of protection. It is not a
commonly-received idea that man--not primitive man but the
partially-completed article of a partially-completed cosmic age--is
scrupulous with regard to woman. The general idea to the contrary
effect is true _en gros_ but not _en detaille_. True of women; not
true of a woman. An educated man, accustomed to judgment and action in
matters requiring thought, thinks, perhaps unconsciously, all round
him, backward as well as forward; but mainly forward. Present
surroundings form his data; consequences represent the conclusion.
Himself remains neutral, an onlooker, until he is called on for
immediate decision and consequent action.

So it was with Athlyne. His instant ejaculation:

“Thank God we didn’t know!” would perhaps have been understood by a
man. To a woman it was incomprehensible. Woman is, after all, more
primitive than man. Her instincts are more self-centred than his. As
her life moves in a narrower circle, her view is rather microscopic
than telescopic; whilst his is the reverse. Inasmuch then as he
naturally surveys a larger field, so his introspective view is wider.

Joy loved the man; and so, since he had already expressed himself,
considered him as already her husband; or to speak more accurately
considered herself as already his wife. It was, therefore, with
something like chagrin that she heard his disavowal of her views. She
did not herself quite understand what those views were, but all the
same it was a disappointment that he did not really acquiesce in them;
nay more that he did not press them on his own account--press them
relentlessly, as a woman loves a man to do, even when his wishes are
opposed to her own.

A woman’s answer to chagrin is ultimate victory of her purpose; and
the chagrin of love is perhaps the strongest passion with a purpose
that can animate her.

When Joy became conscious, as she did in a few seconds, that her lover
following out his protective purpose was about to separate himself
from her--she quite understood without any telling or any experience
both motive and purpose--she opposed it on her part. As the strictness
of his embrace lessened, so in proportion did hers increase. Then came
to the man the reaction--he was only a man, after all. His ardour
redoubled, and her heart beat harder with new love as well as triumph
as he drew her closer to him in a pythonic embrace. Then she, too,
clung to him even closer than before. That embrace was all
lover-like--an agony of rapture.

In its midst they were startled somewhat by the rumbling of a motor
driven fast which seemed to stop close to them. Instinctively Joy
tried to draw away from her lover; such is woman’s impulse. But
Athlyne held her all the tighter--his embrace was not all love now,
but the protection which comes from love. She understood, and resigned
herself to him. And so they stood, heart to heart, and mouth to mouth,
listening.

There was a clatter of tongues in the hall. Joy thought she recognised
one voice--she could not be sure in the distance and through the
closed door--and her heart sank. She would again have tried to draw
away violently but that she was powerless. Her will was gone, like a
bird’s under the stare of the snake. Athlyne, too, was in suspense,
his heart beating wildly. He had a sort of presage of disaster which
seemed in a way to paralyse him.

There were quick steps on the stairs. A voice said: “There” and the
door rattled. At this moment both the lovers were willing to separate.
But before they could do so, the door opened and the figure of Colonel
Ogilvie blocked the entrance.

“Good God!” The old man’s face had grown white as though the sight had
on the instant frozen him. So pallid was he, all in that second, that
Joy and Athlyne received at once the same idea: that his moustache,
which they had thought of snowy whiteness, was but grey against the
marble face.

The father’s instinct was protective too, and his action was quick. In
the instant, without turning his face, he shut the door behind him and
put his heel against it.

“Quick, daughter, quick!” he said in a whisper, low but so fierce that
it cut the air like a knife, “Get into that room and dress yourself.
And, get out if you can, by another way without being noticed!” As he
spoke he pointed towards the open door through which in the darkened
room the bed with clothing in disarray could be dimly seen. Joy fled
incontinently. The movements of a young woman can be of extraordinary
quickness, but never quicker than when fear lends her wings. It seemed
to Athlyne that she made but one jump from where she stood through the
door-way. He could remember afterwards the flash of her bare heels as
she turned in closing the door behind her.

“Now Sir!” Colonel Ogilvie’s voice was stern to deadliness as he
spoke. Athlyne realised its import. He felt that he was bound hand and
foot, and knew that his part of the coming struggle would have to be
passive. He braced himself to endure. Still, the Colonel’s question
had to be answered. The onus of beginning the explanation had been
thrust upon him. It was due to Joy that there should be no delay on
his part in her vindication. Almost sick at heart with apprehension he
began:

“There has been no fault on Joy’s part!” The instant he had spoken,
the look of bitter haughtiness which came on Colonel Ogilvie’s face
warned him that he had made a mistake. To set the error right he must
know what he had to meet; and so he waited.

“We had better, I think, leave Miss Ogilvie’s name out of our
conversation. … And I may perhaps remind you, sir, that I am the
best judge of my daughter’s conduct. When I have said anything to my
daughter’s detriment it will be quite time for a stranger to interfere
on her behalf. … It is of _your_ conduct, sir, that I ask--demand
explanation!”

Athlyne would have liked to meet a speech of this kind with a blow. In
the case of any other man he would have done so: but this man was
Joy’s father, and in all circumstances must be treated as such. He
felt in a vague sort of way--a background of thought rather than
thought itself--that his manhood was being tested, and by a fiery
test. Come what might, he must be calm, or at least be master of
himself; or else bitter woe would come to Joy. Of course it would
come--perhaps had come already to himself; but to that he was already
braced.

Colonel Ogilvie was skilled in the deadly preliminaries to lethal
quarrel. More than once when a foe had been marked down for vengeance
had he led him on to force the duel himself. In no previous quarrel of
his life had he ever had the good cause that he had now, and be sure
that he used that knowledge to the full. There was in his nature
something of that stoical quality of the Red Indian which enables him
to enjoy the torture of his foe, though the doing so entails a keen
anguish to himself. Perhaps the very air of the “dark and bloody
ground” of Kentucky was so impregnated with the passions of those who
made it so that the dwelling of some generations had imbued the
dwellers with some of the old Indian spirit. As Athlyne stood face to
face with him, watching for every sign of intention as a fencer
watches his opponent, he realised that there would be for him no pity,
no mercy, not even understanding. He would have to fight an uphill
contest--if Joy was to be saved even a single pang. What he could do
he would: sacrifice himself in any way that a man can accomplish it.
Life and happiness had for him passed by! One of his greatest
difficulties would be, he felt, that of so controlling himself that he
would not of necessity shut behind him, by anything which he might say
or do, the door of conciliation. He began at once, therefore, to
practice soft answering:

“My conduct, sir, has been bad--so far as doing an indiscreet thing,
and in not showing to you that respect which is your due in any matter
in which Miss Ogilvie may be concerned.” For some reason which he
could not at the moment understand this seemed to infuriate the
Colonel more than ever. In quite a violent way he burst out:

“So I am to take it that no respect is due to me in my own person!
Such, I gather from your words. You hint if you do not say that
respect is only my due on my daughter’s account!” At the risk of
further offence Athlyne interrupted him. It would not do for him to
accept this monstrous reading of what he meant for courtesy:

“Not so, sir. My respect is to you always and for all causes. I did
but put it in that way as it is only in connection with your daughter
that I dared to speak at all.” Even this pacific explanation seemed to
add fuel to the old man’s choler:

“Let me tell you, sir, that this has nothing whatever to do with my
daughter. Miss Ogilvie is my care. Her defence, if any be required, is
my duty--my privilege. And I quite know how to exercise--and to
defend--both.”

“Quite so, sir. I realise that, and I have no wish to arrogate to
myself your right or your duty; for either of which I myself should be
proud to die!” Athlyne’s voice and manner were so suave and
deferential that Colonel Ogilvie began to have an idea that he was a
poltroon; and in this belief the bully that was in him began to
manifest itself. He spoke harshly, intending to convey this idea,
though as he did so his heart smote him. Even as he spoke there rose
before his bloodshot eyes the vision of a river shimmering with gold
as the sunset fell on it, and projected against it the figure of a
frightened woman tugging at the reins of a run-away mare; whilst close
behind her rode a valiant man guiding with left hand a splendid black
horse to her side, his right hand stretched out to drag her to his
saddle. Before them both lay a deadly chasm. In the pause Athlyne took
the opportunity of hurriedly putting on his outer clothing.

But even that touching vision did not check the father’s rage. His
eyes were bloodshot and even such vision--any vision--could not linger
in them. It passed, leaving in its place only a red splotch--as of
blood; the emotion which the thought had quickened had become
divergent in its own crooked way. But in the pause Athlyne had time to
get in a word:

“Sir, whatever fault there has been was mine entirely. I acted
foolishly perhaps, and unthinkingly. It placed us--placed me in such a
position that every accident multiplied possibilities of
misunderstanding. I cannot undo that now--I don’t even say that I
would if I could. But whatever may be my fate--in the result that may
follow my acts--I shall accept it without cavil. And may I say in
continuance and development of your own suggestion, that no other name
should be mentioned in whatever has to be spoken of between us.” As he
finished he unconsciously stood upon his dignity, drawing himself up
to his full height and standing in soldierly attitude. This had a
strange effect on Colonel Ogilvie. Realising that he could rely
implicitly on the dignity of the man before him, he allowed himself a
further latitude. He could afford, he felt, to be unrestrained in such
a presence; and so proceeded to behave as though he was stark, staring
raving mad. Athlyne saw the change and, with some instinct more
enlightening than his reason, realised that the change might later,
have some beneficent effect. More than ever did he feel now the need
for his own absolute self-control. It was well that he had made up his
mind to this, for it was bitterly tested in Colonel Ogilvie’s mad
outpour:

“Do you dare, sir, to lecture me as to what I shall not say or shall
say about my own daughter. What shall I say to you who though you had
not the courtesy to even acknowledge the kindness shown you by her
parents, came behind my back when I was far away, and stole her from
my keeping. Who took her far away, to the risk even of her reputation.
Risk! Risk! When I find you here together, alone and almost naked in
each other’s arms! God’s Death! that I should have seen such a
thing--that such a thing should be. …” Here his hot wrath changed to
ice-cold deadly purpose, and he went on:

“You shall answer me with your life for that!” He paused, still
glaring at the other with cold, deadly malevolence. Athlyne felt that
the hour of the Forlorn Hope had come to him at last--he had been hot
through all his seeming coolness at de Hooge’s Spruit. His
self-control, could, he felt never be more deeply tested than now; and
he braced himself to it. He had now to so bear himself that Joy would
suffer the minimum of pain. Pain she would have to endure--much pain;
he could not save her from it. He would do what he could; that was all
that remained. With real coolness he met the icy look of his
antagonist as he said with all the grace and courtesy of which he was
naturally master:

“Sir, I answer for my deeds with my life. That life is yours now. Take
it, how and when you will! As to answering in words, such cannot be
whilst you maintain your present attitude. I have tried already to
answer--to explain.”

“Explain sir! There is no explanation.”

“Pardon me!” Athlyne’s voice was calm as ever; his dignity so superb
that the other checked the words on his lips as he went on:

“There is an explanation to be made--and made it must be, for the sake
of … of another. I deny in no way your right of revenge. I think I
have already told you that my life is yours to take as you will. But a
dying man has, in all civilised places, a right to speak to the Court
which condemns him. Such privilege is mine. I claim it--if you will
force me to say so. And let me add, Colonel Ogilvie, that I hold it as
a part of my submission to your will. We are alone now and can speak
freely; but there must be a time--it will be for your own protection
from the legal consequences of my death--when others, or at least one
other, will know of your intention to kill. I shall speak then if I
may not now!” Here the Colonel, whose anger was rising at being so
successfully baffled, interrupted him with hard cynicism.

“Conditions in an affair of honour! To be enforced in a court of law I
suppose.” He felt ashamed of himself as he made the remark which he
felt to be both ungenerous and untrue. He was not surprised when the
other answered his indignant irony with scorn:

“No sir! No law! Not any more appeal to law in my defence than there
has been justice in your outrageous attack on me. But about that I
shall answer you presently. In the meantime I adhere to my conditions.
Aye, conditions; I do not hesitate to use the word.”

Colonel Ogilvie, through all the madness of his anger, realised at
that moment that the man before him was a strong man, as fearless and
determined as he was himself. This brought back his duty of good
manners as a first instalment of his self-possession. For a few
seconds he actually withheld his speech. He even bowed slightly as the
other proceeded:

“I have tried to explain. … My fault was in venturing to ask … a
lady to come for a ride in my car. I had no intention of evil. Nothing
more than a mere desire to renew and further an--a friendship which
had, from the first moment of my knowing her--or rather from the first
moment I set eyes on her, become very dear to me. It was a selfish
wish I know; and in my own happiness at her consent I
overlooked,--neglected--forgot the duty I owed to her father. For that
I am bitterly sorry, and I feel that I owe to him a debt which I can
never, never repay. But enough of that. … That belongs to a
different category, and it has to be atoned for in the only way by
which an honourable man can atone. … As I have already conceded my
life to him I need … can say no more. But from the moment when that
lady stepped into my car my respect has been for her that which I have
always intended to be given to whatever lady should honour me by
becoming my wife. Surely you, sir, as yourself an honourable man--a
husband and a father, cannot condemn a man for speaking an honourable
love to the woman to whom it has been given. When I have admitted that
the making of the occasion was a fault I have said all that I accept
as misdoing. …” He folded his arms and stood on his dignity. For a
few seconds, Colonel Ogilvie stood motionless, silent. He could not
but recognise the truth that underlay all the dignity of the other.
But he was in no way diverted by it from his purpose. His anger was in
no way mitigated; his intention of revenge lessened by no whit. He was
merely waiting to collect his thoughts so as to be in a position to
attack with most deadly effect. He was opening his lips to speak when
the other went on as though he had but concluded one section or
division of what he had to say:

“And now sir as to the manifest doubt you expressed as to my _bona
fides_ in placing my life in your hands--your apprehension lest I
should try to evade my responsibility to the laws of honour by an
appeal in some way to a court of law. Let me set your mind at ease by
placing before you my views; and my views, let me tell you, are
ultimately my intentions. I have tried to assure you that with the
exception of waiting to ask your consent to taking … a certain
passenger for a drive, my conduct has from that moment been such as
you could not find fault with. I take it for granted that you--nor no
man--could honestly resent such familiarities as are customary to, and
consequent on, a man offering marriage to a lady, and pressing his
suit with such zeal as is, or should be, attendant on the expression
of a passion which he feels very deeply!” Even whilst he was speaking,
his subconsciousness was struck by his own coolness. He marvelled that
he could, synchronously with the fearful effort necessary to his
self-control and with despair gnawing at his heart, speak with such
cold blooded preciseness. As is usual in such psychical stresses his
memory took note for future reference of every detail.

His opponent on the contrary burst all at once into another fit of
flaming passion. Athlyne’s very preciseness seemed to have inflamed
him afresh. He thundered out:

“Familiarities sir, on offering marriage! Do you dare to trifle with
me at a time like this. When but a few minutes ago I saw you here in
this lonely place, at this hour of the morning after a night of
absence, undressed as you were, holding in your arms my daughter
undressed also… God’s death! sir, be careful or you shall rue it!”
He stopped almost choking with passion. Athlyne felt himself once more
overwhelmed with the cold wave of responsibility. “Joy! Joy! Joy!” he
kept repeating to himself as a sort of charm to keep off evil. To let
go his anger now might--would be fatal to her happiness. He marvelled
to himself as he went on in equal voice, seemingly calm:

“That sir was with no intent of evil. ’Twas but a natural consequence
of the series of disasters which fell on the enterprise which had so
crowned my happiness. When I turned to come home so that … so that
the lady might be in time to meet her parents who were expected to
arrive at--at her destination, I forgot, in my eagerness to meet her
wishes, the regulations as to speed; and I was arrested for furious
driving. In my anxiety to save her from any form of exposal to
publicity, and in my perplexity as to how to manage it, I advised her
returning by herself in my motor, I remaining at Dalry. When she had
gone, and I had arranged for attending the summons served on me, I
wired over to this hotel to keep me rooms. I thought it better that as
J … that as the lady had gone to England I should remain in
Scotland. I started to walk here; but I was overtaken by a fog and
delayed for hours behind my time. The house was locked up--every one
asleep. The night porter who let me in told me that as I had not
arrived, as by my telegram, the bedroom I had ordered was let to some
one else who had arrived in a plight similar to my own. ‘Another
party’ were his words; I had no clue to whom or what the other visitor
was. The only place left in the house unoccupied--for there were many
unexpected guests through the fog--was that sofa. There I slept. Only
a few minutes ago I was waked by some one coming into the room. When
I saw that it was … when I saw who it was--the woman whom I loved
and whom I intended to marry--I naturally took her in my arms without
thinking.” Then without pausing, for he saw the anger in the Colonel’s
face and felt that to prolong this part of the narration was
dangerous, he went on quickly:

“I trust that you understand, Colonel Ogilvie, that this explanation
in no way infringes your right of punishing me as you suggest. Please
understand--and this is my answer to your suggestion as to my
appealing to law--that I accept your wish to go through the form of a
duel!” He was hotly interrupted by the Colonel:

“Form of a duel! Is this another insult? When I say fight I mean
fight--understand that. I fight _à l’outrance_; and that way only.”
Athlyne’s composure did not seem even ruffled:

“Exactly! I took no other meaning. But surely I am entitled to take it
that even a real duel has the form of a duel!”

“Then what do you mean sir by introducing the matter that way?”

“Simply, Colonel Ogilvie, to protect myself from a later accusation on
your part--either to me or of me--of a charge of poltroonery; or even
a silent suspicion of it in your own mind!”

“How do you mean?”

“Sir, I only speak for myself. I have already said more than once that
I hold my life at your disposal. From that I do not shrink; I accept
the form of a duel for my execution.”

“Your execution! Explain yourself, sir?” In a calm even voice came the
answer.

“Colonel Ogilvie, I put it to you as man to man--if you will honour me
with so simple a comparison, or juxtaposition whichever you like to
consider it--how can I fight freely against the father of the woman
whom I love. Pray, sir,” for the Colonel made an angry gesture “be
patient for a moment. I intend no kind of plea or appeal. I feel
myself forced to let you know my position from my point of view. You
need bear no new anger towards me for this expression of my feelings.
I do so with reluctance, and only because you _must_ understand, here
and now, or it may make, later on, further unhappiness for some one
else--some one whom we both hold in our hearts.” Colonel Ogilvie
hesitated before replying. The bitter scowl was once again on his face
as he spoke:

“Then I suppose I am to take it, sir, that you will begin our meeting
on the field of honour by putting me publicly--through the expression
of your intention--in the position of a murderer.”

“Not so! Surely you know better than that. I did not think that any
honourable man could have so mistaken another. If I have to speak
explicitly on this point--on which for your own sake and the sake of
… of one dear to you, I would fain be reticent--let me reassure you
on one point: I shall play the game fairly. For this duel is a game,
and, so far as I am concerned at all events, one for a pretty large
stake. If indeed that can be called a ‘game’ which can only end in one
way. You need not, I assure you, feel the least uneasy as to my not
going through with it properly. I am telling you this now so that you
may not distort my intention yourself by some injudicious comment on
my conduct, or speech, or action, made under a misapprehension or from
distrust of me. Sir, your own honour shall be protected all along, so
far as the doing so possibly rests with me.” Here, seeing some new
misunderstanding in the Colonel’s eye he went on quickly:

“I venture to say this because I am aware that you doubt my being able
to carry out my intention. When I say ‘rests with me,’ I mean the
responsibility of acting properly the rôle I have undertaken. I shall
conduct my part of the duel in all seriousness. It must be in some
other country; this for your sake. For mine it will not have mattered.
We have only to bear ourselves properly and none will suspect. I shall
go through all the forms--with your permission--of fighting _à
l’outrance_, so that no one can suspect. No one will be able
afterwards to say that you could have been aware of my intention. I
shall fire at you all right; but I shall not hit!”

Instinctively Colonel Ogilvie bowed. He did not intend to do so. He
said no word. The rancour of his heart was not mitigated; his
intention to kill in no way lessened. His action was simply a
spontaneous recognition of the chivalry of another, and his
appreciation of it.

Athlyne could not but be glad of even so slight a relaxation of the
horrible tension. He stood quite still. He felt that in some way he
had scored with his antagonist; and as he was fighting for Joy he was
unwilling to do anything which might not be good for her. He was
standing well out in the room with his back to the door of the
bedroom. As they stood he saw a look of surprise flash in Colonel
Ogilvie’s face. This changed instantly to a fixed one of horror. His
eyes seemed to look right through his antagonist to something beyond.
Instinctively he turned to see what it might be that caused that
strange look. And then he looked horrified himself.

In the open door-way of the bedroom stood Joy.




 CHAPTER XX.
 KNOWLEDGE OF LAW

All three stood stone still. Not a sound was heard except faint
quick breathing. Athlyne tried to think; but his brain seemed numb. He
knew that now was a crisis if not _the_ crisis of the whole affair. It
chilled him with a deathly chill to think that Joy must have heard all
the conversation between her father and himself. What a remembrance
for her in all the empty years to come! What sorrow, what pain!
Presently he heard behind him as he stood facing her a sound which was
rather a groan than an ejaculation--a groan endowed with articulated
utterance:

“Good God!” Unconsciously he repeated the word under his breath:

“Good God!”

Joy, with a fixed high-strung look, stepped down into the room. She
stood beside Athlyne who, as she came close to him, turned with her so
that together they faced her father. Colonel Ogilvie said in a slow
whisper, the words dropping out one by one:

“Have--you--been--there--all--the--time?
Did--you--hear--all--we--said?” She answered boldly:

“Yes! I was there and heard everything!” Again a long pause of
silence, ended by Colonel Ogilvie’s next question:

“Why did you stay?” Joy answered at once; her quick speech following
the slow tension sounded almost voluble.

“I could not get away. I wanted to; but there is no other door to the
room. That is why I came out here when I woke. … I could not get my
boots which the maid had taken last night, and I wanted to get away as
quickly as possible. And, Father, being there, though I had to move
about dressing myself, I could not help hearing everything!” Her
father had evidently expected that she would say something more, for
as she stopped there he looked at her expectantly. There was a sort of
dry sob in his throat. Athlyne stood still and silent; he hardly dared
to breathe lest he should unintentionally thwart Joy’s purpose. For
with all his instincts he realised that she had a purpose. He knew
that she understood her father and that she was the most potent force
to deal with him; and knowing this he felt that the best thing he
could do would be to leave her quite free and unhampered to take her
own course. He kept his eyes on her face, gazing at her unwinkingly.
Her face was fixed--not stern but set to a purpose. Somehow at that
moment he began to realise how well he understood her. Without more
help than his eyes could give him, he seemed to follow the workings of
her mind. For her mind was changing. At the first her expression was
of flinty fixedness; but as she continued to look at the old man it
softened; and with the softening her intentioned silence gave way. Her
lover’s thoughts translated thus:

“I will protect my--him against my father. He has threatened him; he
is forcing him to death. I shall not help him by sparing him a pang,
an awkwardness. And yet--why that? He is an old man--and my father!
That white hair demands respect. He is angry--hard and untender now;
but his life has been a tender one to me--and he is my father! Though
I am determined to save my lover--my husband, I need not in the doing
cause that white head to sink in shame; I can spare him the pang of
what he may think ingratitude in me. And, after all, he has what must
seem to him just cause of offence. … He cannot--will not understand.
… He is brave and proud, and has a code of honour which is more than
a religion. And he my lover--my husband is brave too. And as
unyielding as my father. And he is willing to die--for me. To die for
me--_my_ honour _my_ happiness. Though his dying is worse--far worse
than death to me. … But he is dying bravely, and I--that was to have
been his wife--must die bravely, worthily too. If he can suffer and
die in silence, so too must I. …”

It seemed a natural sequence of thought when she said to her father:

“Daddy, do you know you have not said a word to me yet. What have I
ever done in my life that you should not trust me now? Have I ever
lied to you that you cannot trust me to answer truly when you ask
me--ask me anything. Why don’t you ask me now? I know that things do
not look well. I realise that you must have been shocked when you came
into the room. But, Daddy dear, there are few things in the world that
cannot be explained--at any rate in part. Don’t forget that I am a
woman now. I am no longer a child whose ignorance is her innocence.
Speak to me! Ask me what you will, and I will answer you truly! Hear
me, even as you would listen to one dying! For indeed it is so. If you
carry out your intention, as I have heard it expressed, I shall no
longer live; there will be nothing for me to live for.”

“Do you mean that you will commit suicide?” said her father.

“Oh, no! I hope I have pluck enough to live--if I can. Do not fear for
me, Daddy! I shall play the game full, as he will do.” As she spoke,
she pointed a finger at Athlyne. She felt now, and for the first time,
acutely that she did not know what to call him before a third
person--even her father. Athlyne looked relieved by her words. When
she spoke of dying he had grown sadly white; he shared her father’s
apprehension. Colonel Ogilvie saw the change in his look, and took it
ill. As may be surmised a part of his anger towards Athlyne arose from
jealousy. Until this man had appeared upon the scene his “little girl”
was his alone; no other man shared in her affection. As she was an
only child all his parental affection had been centred in her. Though
he might have been prepared to see her mate with a man of his own
choosing--or at any rate of his acceptance, he was jealous of the man
who had stepped in, unaccredited and wanting in deference to himself.
It must have been a tinge of this jealousy which prompted his next
question. Turning with a bitter formality to Athlyne he said:

“I suppose you are satisfied, now, sir. Whatever may come, my daughter
is estranged from me; and it is your doing!” In answer Joy and Athlyne
spoke together. Said the latter:

“Oh sir!” There he stopped; he feared to say more lest his anger
should master him. But the protest was effective; the old man
flushed--over forehead and ears and neck. Joy spoke in a different
vein:

“There is no estrangement, Daddy dear; and therefore it can be no
one’s doing. Least of all could such a thing come from this man who
loves me, and … and whom I love.” As she spoke she blushed divinely,
and taking her lover’s right hand between both her hands held it
tight. This seemed for some reason to infuriate her father afresh. He
strode forward towards Athlyne as though about to strike him. But at
the instant there came a quick rap on the door. Instinctively he drew
away, and, having called out “Come!” stood expectingly and seemingly
calm. The door opened slightly and the voice of the Sheriff was heard:

“May I come in? I am Alexander Fenwick, Sheriff of Galloway!” As he
was speaking he entered the room with a formal bow to each in turn. He
continued to speak to Colonel Ogilvie:

“You will pardon this intrusion I hope, sir. Indeed I trust you will
not look upon it as an intrusion at all when you know the reason of my
coming.” Colonel Ogilvie’s habit of old-fashioned courtesy came at
once to the fore with the coming of a stranger. With a bow which to
those reared in a newer and less formal school of manners seemed
almost grandiloquent he spoke:

“I came here on some business, and on my arrival a few minutes ago was
asked by our landlady--an old servant of my own--who on that account
thought that she might ask what she thought a favour--to come up here.
She thought, poor anxious soul, that some unpleasantness might be
afoot as she heard high words, and feared a quarrel. All the more on
account of a sudden arrival of a gentleman who seemed somewhat
incensed. This I took from her description of the personality, to be
you sir. Indeed, I recognise all the points, except that of the
anger!” As he spoke he bowed with pleasant courtesy. The other bowed
too, partly in answer to the implied question and partly in
recognition of the expressed courtesy of the words and manner.

Whilst he had been speaking, the Sheriff had been watching keenly
those around him. He had been for so long a time in the habit of
forming his opinion rather by looks than words that the situation
seemed to explain itself; young lovers, angry father. This opinion was
justified and sustained by the confidence which had been given to him
by Athlyne on the previous afternoon. He had been, on entering the
room, rather anxious at the state of affairs; but now he began to
breathe more freely. He felt that his experience of life and of law
might really be here of some service. But his profession had also
taught him wariness and caution; also not to speak on side issues till
he knew the ground thoroughly. Joy he read like an open book. There
was no mistaking her love, her anxiety, her apprehension. Athlyne he
knew something of already, but he now saw in his face a warning look
which bade him be silent regarding him. He diagnosed Colonel Ogilvie
as a proud, masterful, vain, passionate man; something of a prig;
tender, in a way he understood himself; faithful to his word;
relentless to an expressed intention; just--according to his own ideas
of right and wrong. Weighing these attributes for his own pacific
purposes he came to the conclusion that his first effort at
conciliation should be made with regard to the last-mentioned. So he
began, speaking in a manner of courtly and deferential grace:

“I trust sir, you will yield to me the consideration often asked by,
and sometimes granted to a well-intentioned man, however bungling the
same might be in thought or method or manner.” Colonel Ogilvie
conceded the favour with a gracious bow. Thus emboldened, if not
justified, he went on:

“I fain would ask that I might be allowed to make something in the
nature of a short statement, and to make it without interruption or
expostulation. You will understand why presently.” Again the gracious
acquiescence; he continued:

“You are, I take it, a stranger to this country; though, if I am not
misled by name and lineament, claiming Scottish forbears?” Colonel
Ogilvie’s bow came more naturally this time. His in-lying pride was
coming to the rescue of common sense. The Sheriff understood, and went
on with better heart:

“The experience which I have had in the performance of my duties as
sheriff has shewn me that such a group as I see before me--father,
daughter and lover, if I mistake not--is not uncommon in this part of
Scotland.” No one answered his bow this time. All were grimly silent
in expectancy. He felt that it was a dangerous topic; but the fact had
been stated without being denied. He hurried on:

“Just across the Border, as we are, we have had very many occasions of
run-away marriages; I have had myself in earlier days to explain for
the good of all parties how the law stands in such matters. More than
once the knowledge enabled those interested in it to spare much pain
to others; generally to those whom they loved best. I trust that now
I may use that knowledge in your behalf--as a friend. I am not here in
my official capacity--or perhaps I might not be so free to advise as I
am now without, I trust, offence to any one.” Colonel Ogilvie’s
gracious bow here answered for all the party. The Sheriff felt more at
ease. He was now well into his subject; and the most difficult part of
his duty had been, he thought, passed. All three of his hearers
listened eagerly as he went on:

“A knowledge of the law can hurt no one; though it may now and again
disappoint some one--when expounded too late. Well, there is a common
belief in South Britain--and elsewhere that the marriage law in
Scotland is a very filmy thing, with bounds of demarcation which are
actually nebulous. This doubtless arises from the fact that all such
laws are based on the theory that it is good to help such contracting
parties to the secure and speedy fulfilment of their wishes. But
anyone who thinks that they are loose in either purpose or action is
apt to be rudely enlightened. The Scots’ Marriage laws demand that
there be a manifest and honest intention of marriage on the part of
the contractors. This intention can be proved in many ways. Indeed the
law in certain cases is willing to infer it, when direct proof is not
attainable, from subsequent acts of the parties. I may fairly say that
in all such cases courts of law will hold that mutuality of intention
is of the essence of marriage rite. This followed by co-habitation
_is_ the marriage; though the latter to follow close on the
declaration is not always deemed necessary. In our law the marriage
may be either of two kinds. The most formal is that effected by a
minister or proper official after due calling of banns, or by notice
given to sheriff or registrar. The other form is by what is known in
the law as ‘Irregular marriage.’ This is in legal parlance--for which
I make no apology as it is necessary that all married folk, or those
intending to enter that honourable condition should understand it--is
known as ‘intention followed by copula.’ Now you must know that either
form of marriage is equally binding--equal in law and honour; and when
the conditions attached to each form have been duly fulfilled such
marriage is irrefragable. In old days this facility of marriage made
Gretna Green, which is the first place across the Border, the
objective for eloping lovers matrimonially inclined; and as till 1856
no previous residence in Scotland was required, romance was supposed
to stop at the Border. That is, the marriage could be effected and
parental objections--did such exist--were overborne. There were many
cynical souls who held that repentance for the hasty marriage could
then begin. I feel bound to say that this is an opinion in which I do
not myself share.

“In 1856 an Act of Parliament, 20th Vict. Cap. 96, was passed, by
which it became necessary for the validity of irregular marriage that
at least one of the two contractors should have his or her usual
residence in Scotland, or have been resident in Scotland for three
full weeks next preceding the marriage.

“I thank you, Colonel Ogilvie, for having listened to me so patiently.
But as I have no doubt that you three have much to say to each other I
shall withdraw for the present. This will leave you free to discuss
matters. And perhaps I may say, as an old man as well as a responsible
officer of the Law, that I trust the effect will be to make for peace
and amity. I am staying here in the hotel and I shall take it as a
great pleasure and a great honour if you will breakfast with me in say
an hour’s time. All your family will be most welcome.” With a bow, in
which deference and geniality were mingled, he withdrew.

Each of the three left kept looking at each other in silence. Joy drew
closer to Athlyne and took his hand. Colonel Ogilvie pretended not to
notice the act--an effort on his part which made his daughter radiant
with hope. The first words spoken were by the Colonel:

“That man is a gentleman!” The two others felt that silence was
present discretion; to agree with Colonel Ogilvie in his present mood
was almost as dangerous as to disagree with him. His next words were
in no way conciliatory though the _arrière pensée_ made for hope.

“Now sir, what have you to say for yourself in this unhappy matter?
Remember I in no way relax my intention of--of punishment; but I am
willing to hear what you have to say.” Athlyne winced at the word
“punishment,” which was not one which he was accustomed to hear
applied to himself. But for Joy’s sake he made no comment. He even
kept his face fixed so as not to betray his anger. He felt that any
change of subject, or drifting off that before them, must be for the
better; things could, he felt, hardly be worse than at present.
Moreover, it might smooth matters somewhat if Colonel Ogilvie could be
brought to recollect that he was not himself an undesirable person for
alliance, and that his intention of matrimony had been already brought
before Joy’s father. In this conviction he spoke:

“As in this country, sir, intention counts for so much, may I crave
your indulgence for a moment and refer you back to my letter to you on
the subject of a very dear wish of mine--a wish put before you with a
very decided intention.” Colonel Ogilvie’s answer, given in manner of
equal suavity, was disconcerting; the bitterness behind it was
manifest.

“I think sir, there must be some error--which is not mine. I never
received any letter from you! Your epistolary efforts seem to have
been confined to the ladies of my family.” With an effort Athlyne
restrained himself. When he felt equal to the task he spoke, still
with a manner of utmost deference:

“An error there surely is; but it is not mine either. I posted
yesterday at the Ambleside post office a letter to you. …” He was
interrupted by Colonel Ogilvie who said bluntly:

“I am not so sure, sir, that the fault of my not reading such a letter
was not yours; though perhaps not in the direct manner you mean. When
I arrived home last night and found the horrible state of things with
regard to my daughter’s rash act--due to you” this with a look of
actual malevolence “I was so upset that I did not look at the pile of
letters awaiting me. I only read Joy’s messages.” As he said this
Athlyne’s eyes flashed and there was an answering flash in the eyes of
the woman who looked so keenly at him; this was the first time since
his arrival that the father had condescended to even mention his
daughter’s name. There might be some softening of that hard nature
after all. Then the old man continued:

“I put them in my pocket; here they are!”--Whilst he looked at the
envelopes in that futile way that some people unused to large
correspondence love, Joy said with an easy calmness which made her
lover glance at her in surprise:

“Daddy, hadn’t you better read your letters now; we shall wait.” The
tone was so much that to which he was accustomed from her that he did
not notice the compromising “we” which would otherwise have inflamed
him afresh. Drawing a chair close to one of the windows he opened the
letters and began to read. Athlyne and Joy, instinctively and with
unity of thought, moved towards the other window which was behind him.
There they stood hand in hand, their eyes following every movement of
the old man. Joy did not know, of course, what was in the letter; but
she had seen it before in the garden at Ambleside and when he had
posted it before setting out on their motor ride. And so, piecing her
information with the idea conveyed by her lover’s recent words, she
was able to form some sort of idea of its general import. A soft,
beautiful blush suffused her face, and her eyes glistened as she stood
thinking; in the effort of thought she recalled many sweet passages.
She now understood in a vague way what was the restraining influence
which had moved her lover to reticence during all those hours when he
had tried to tell her of his love and his hopes without actually
speaking words, the knowledge of which given without his consent would
have incensed her father against him, and so wrought further havoc. So
moved was she that Athlyne, whose eyes were instinctively drawn to her
from the observation of her father, was amazed and not a little
disconcerted. There must be some strange undercurrent of feeling in
her which he could not understand. Joy saw the look on his face and
seemed to understand. She raised to her lips the hand that she so
strongly clasped in hers and kissed it. Then she raised a finger of
her other hand and touched her lips. Thus reassured of her love and
understanding, Athlyne followed with his eyes the trend of hers; and
so together they continued to watch her father, trying to gather from
his bearing some indication of his thoughts. Indeed this was not a
difficult matter. Colonel Ogilvie seemed to have lost himself in his
task, and expressed his comments on what he read by a series of
childlike movements and ejaculations. Athlyne who knew what the letter
contained could apply these enlightening comments, and even Joy in her
ignorance of detail could inferentially follow the text. Colonel
Ogilvie did say a word of definite speech, but the general tendency of
his comment was that of surprise--astonishment. When he had finished
reading Athlyne’s letter--it was the last of the batch--he sat for
quite half a minute quite still and silent, holding the paper between
finger and thumb of his dropped left hand. Then with a deep frown on
his forehead he began to read it again. He was evidently looking for
some passage, for when he had found it he stood up at once and turned
to them. By this time Joy, warned by the movement, had dropped her
lover’s hand and now stood some distance away from him. The old man
began:

“Sir … There is a passage in a letter here which I understand to be
yours. So far I must acknowledge that I have been wrong. You evidently
_did_ send the letter, and I evidently received it. Listen to this:
‘Having heard in a roundabout way that there was a woman in New York
who was passing herself off as my wife I undertook a journey to that
City to make investigation into the matter; and in order to secure the
necessary secrecy as to my movements took for the time an assumed
name--or rather used as Christian and surname two of those names in
the middle of my full equipment which I do not commonly use.’ What
does all that mean? No, do not speak. Wait and I shall tell you. You
say the lady--woman you call her--took your name. For saying such a
thing, and for the disrespect in her description as a woman, you will
have to answer me. Either of them will cost you your life.” Athlyne
answered with a quiet, impressive dignity which helped in some degree
to reassure Joy who stood motionless in open-eyed wonder--her heart
seeming to her as cold as ice at the horror of this new phase of
danger. It was a veritable “bolt from the blue,” incomprehensible to
her in every way:

“Colonel Ogilvie, I regret I shall be unable to meet your wishes in
this respect!” As the old man looked astonished in his turn, he
proceeded:

“I already owe you a life on another count; and I have but one. But if
I had ten you should have them all, could they in any way assuage the
sorrow which it seems must follow from my thoughtless act. I have told
you already that I shall freely give my life in expiation of the wrong
I have--all unintentionally--done to your daughter and yourself. And
if any means could be found by which it could add to Joy’s happiness
or lessen her sorrow I should in addition and as freely give my soul!”

Colonel Ogilvie’s reception of these words was characteristic of the
man, as he took himself to be. He drew himself up to his full height
and stood at attention. Then he saluted, and followed his salute with
a grave bow. The soldier in him spoke first, the man after. Both Joy
and Athlyne noticed with new hope that he allowed the speaking of her
name to pass unchallenged as a further cause of offence. Presently,
and in a new tone, he said:

“I have taken it for granted from the allusions in your letter that
you are the writer; and from your mentioning an alias have not been
surprised at seeing a strange name in the signature. But I have been
and am surprised at the familiarity from a man of your years to a man
of mine of a mere Christian name.”

It was now Athlyne’s turn to be surprised.

“A Christian name!” he said with a puzzled pucker of his brows. “I am
afraid I don’t understand.” Then a light dawning on him he said with a
slight laugh: “But that is not my Christian name.”

“Then your surname?” queried the Colonel.

“Nor my surname either.” His laugh was now more pronounced, more
boyish.

“Oh I see; still another alias!” The words were bitter; the tone of
manifest offence.

Athlyne laughed again; it was not intentional but purely spontaneous.
He was recalled to seriousness by the look of pain and apprehension on
Joy’s face and by the Colonel’s angry words, given with a look of
fury:

“I am not accustomed to be laughed at--and to my face Mr.--Mr.--Mr.
Richard Hardy Athlyne et cetera.”

His apology for inopportune mirth was given with contrition--even
humbly:

“I ask your pardon, Colonel Ogilvie, very deeply, very truly. But the
fact is that Athlyne is my proper signature, though it is neither
Christian name nor surname. I do hope you will attribute my rudeness
rather to national habit than to any personal wish to wound. Surely
you will see that I would at least be foolish to transgress in such a
direction, if it be only that I aim at so much that it is in your
power to grant.” There was reason in this which there was no
resisting. Colonel Ogilvie bowed--he felt that he could do no less.
Athlyne wisely said no more; both men regarded the incident as closed.

With Joy it was different. The incident gave her the information she
lacked for the completion of the circle of her knowledge. As with a
flash she realised the whole secret: that this man who had saved her
life and whom now her father wanted to kill was none other than the
man whose name she had taken--at first in sport and only lately in
order to protect herself from troubles of inquisitiveness and scandal.
At the moment she was in reality the only one of the three--the only
one at all--who had in her hand all the clues. Neither her father nor
Athlyne knew that she had given to the maid at the hotel a name other
than her own.

She began to have also an unconscious knowledge of something else.
Something which she could not define, some intuition of some coming
change; something which hinged on her giving of the name. Now, for the
first time she realised how dangerous it may be for any one to take
the name of any other person--for any purpose whatever, or from any
cause. She could not see the end.

But though her brain did not classify the idea her blood did. She
blushed so furiously that she had serious thoughts of escaping from
the room. Nothing but the danger which might arise from such a step
kept her in her place. But something must, she felt, be done. Things
were so shaping towards reconciliation that it would be wise to
prevent matters slipping back. For an instant she was puzzled as to
what to do; then an inspiration came to her. Turning to her father she
said:

“Daddy, let us ask the old Sheriff to come in again!” She felt that
she could rely on his discretion, and that in his hands things might
slide into calmer waters. Her father acquiesced willingly, and a
courteous message was sent through a servant.




 CHAPTER XXI.
 APPLICATION OF LAW

Whilst the servant was gone there was a great clatter of arrival of
a motor at the hotel; but all in Athlyne’s room were too deeply
concerned with their own affairs to notice it.

Presently there was a light tap at the door, and the Sheriff’s “May I
come in?” was heard. Colonel Ogilvie went himself to the door and
threw it open. Beside the Sheriff stood a lady, heavily clad and with
a motor veil.

“Joy! Joy!” said the veiled figure, and Aunt Judy stepping forward
took the girl in her arms. In the meantime the Sheriff was explaining
the situation:

“I was just coming from my room in obedience to your summons, when
this lady entered the hall. She was asking for you, Colonel, and for
Miss Ogilvie, as who she had learned at the railway station, was
stopping here. I ventured to offer my services, and as she was coming
up here, undertook to pilot her.”

Joy was delighted to see Judy. She had so long been accustomed to look
with fixed belief on her love and friending that she now expected she
would be able to set matters right. Had she had any doubt of her
Aunt’s affection such must have soon disappeared in the warmth of the
embrace accorded by her. When this was concluded--which was soon for
it was short, if strenuous--she turned to Colonel Ogilvie and held out
her hand:

“Good morning, Lucius. I see you got here all right. I hope you had a
good journey?” Then turning to Athlyne she said, as if in surprise:

“Why, Mr. Hardy, how are you? And how do you come to be here? We
thought we were never going to see you again.” Then she rattled on; it
was evident to Joy, and to Colonel Ogilvie also, that she was
purposeful to baffle comment by flow of her own speech:

“Lucius, you must thank this gentleman who is, as the landlady
whispered to me, the Sheriff of somewhere or other. He’s a nice man,
but a funny sort of Sheriff. When I asked him where was his posse he
didn’t know what I meant.” Here she was interrupted by the Sheriff who
said with a low bow to her:

“It is enough for any man, dear lady, to be in _esse_ in such a
charming presence!” Judy did not comprehend the joke; but she knew,
being a woman, that some sort of compliment was intended; and, being a
woman, beamed accordingly:

“Thank you, sir, both for your kindness in helping me and for your
pretty talk. Joy, I have brought your dressing bag and a fresh rig
out. You must need them, poor dear. Now you must tell me all your
adventures. I told them to bring the things presently to your room. I
shall then come with you whilst you are changing. Now, Mr. Sheriff, we
must leave you for a little; but I suppose that as you have to talk
business--you told me they had sent for you--you will doubtless prefer
to be without us?”

“Your pardon,” said the Sheriff gracefully. “I hope the time will
never come when I shall prefer to be without such charming company!”
This was said with such a meaning look, and in such a meaning tone,
that Judy coloured. Joy, unseen by the others, smiled at her,
rejoicing. The Sheriff, thinking they were moving off, turned to the
Colonel saying:

“Now, Colonel Ogilvie, I am at your disposal; likewise such knowledge
of law and custom as I possess.” He purposely addressed himself to
Colonel Ogilvie, evidently bearing in mind Athlyne’s look of warning
to silence regarding himself.

Whilst he had been speaking, Joy stood still, holding Judy by the hand
and keeping her close to her. Judy whispered, holding her mouth close
to her ear and trying to avoid the observation of the others:

“Come away dear whilst they are talking. They will be freer alone!”
Joy whispered in return:

“No, I must not go. I must stay here, I am wanted. Do not say
anything, dear--not a word; but stay by me.” Judy in reply squeezed
her hand and remained silent. Colonel Ogilvie, with manifest
uneasiness and after clearing his throat, said to the Sheriff:

“As you have been so good sir, as to tell me some matters of law; and
as you have very kindly offered us other services, may I trespass on
your kindness in enlightening me as to some matters of fact.” The
Sheriff bowed; he continued:

“I must crave your indulgence, for I am in some very deep distress,
and possibly not altogether master of myself. But I need some advice,
or at any rate enlightenment as to some matters of law. And as I am
far from home and know no one here who is of legal authority--except
yourself,” this with a bow, “I shall be deeply grateful if I may
accept your kindness and speak to you as a friend.” Again the Sheriff
bowed, his face beaming. Colonel Ogilvie, with a swift, meaning glance
at each of the others in turn, went on:

“I must ask you all to keep silent. I am speaking with this gentleman
for my own enlightenment, and require no comments from any of you.
Indeed, I forbid interruption!” Unpromising as this warning sounded,
both Joy and Athlyne took a certain comfort from it. The point they
both attached importance to was that Athlyne was simply classed with
the rest without differentiation. The Sheriff, who feared lest the
father’s domineering tone might provoke hostilities, spoke quickly:

“Now, Colonel Ogilvie, I am at your disposal for whatever you may wish
to ask me.”

“I suppose Mr. Sheriff, I need not say, that I trust you will observe
honourable silence regarding this whole painful affair; as I expect
that all present will.” This was said with a threatening smile. When
the Sheriff bowed acceptance of the condition he went on:

“Since you spoke to us here a little while ago a strange enlightenment
has come to me. Indeed a matter so strange and so little in accord
with the experiences of my own life that I am in a quandary. I should
really like to know exactly how I--how we all stand at present. From
what you have said about the Scottish marriage laws I take it that you
have an inkling of what has gone on. And so, as you are in our
confidence, you will not perhaps mind if I confide further in you?”

“I shall be deeply honoured, Colonel Ogilvie.”

“Thank you again, sir. You are a true friend to a man in deep distress
and in much doubt … We are, as you perhaps know, Americans. My
daughter’s life was saved by a gentleman in New York. I think it right
to say that it was on his part a very gallant act, and that we were
all deeply grateful to him. He came to my house--at my own invitation;
and my wife and her sister, Miss Judith Hayes”--the Sheriff turned to
Judy and bowed as at an introduction; she curtsied in reply--“were
very pleased with him. But we never saw him again. He returned very
soon afterwards to England; and though we were coming to London he
never came near us. Indeed his neglect was marked; for though I
invited him to call, he ignored us.” As he said this he looked
straight at Athlyne with hard eyes. “I have reason to know that my
daughter was much interested in him. Ordinarily speaking I should not
mention a matter of this kind. But as I have received from him--it has
only been made known to me in the interval since our meeting--an
assurance of his affection and a proffer of marriage, I feel that I
may speak.” He turned away and began walking up and down the room as
though trying to collect his thoughts.

As Joy heard him speak of her own interest in the man and of his
proposal of marriage she blushed deeply, letting her eyes fall. But
when, by some of the divine instinct of love, she knew that he was
looking ardently at her she raised them, swimming, to his. And so once
more they looked deep into each other’s souls. Judy felt the trembling
of the girl’s hand and held it harder with a sympathetic clasp, palm
to palm and with fingers interlaced. She felt that she understood; and
her eyes, too, became sympathetically suffused. The Sheriff had now no
eyes except for Judy. Whilst the Colonel had been speaking he had
looked at him of course--he knew well that it would be a cause of
offence if he did not. But the walking up and down gave him
opportunity for his wishes. Judy could not but recognise the ardour of
his glance, and she too blushed exceedingly. Somehow, she was glad of
it; she knew that blushing became her, and she felt that she would
like to look her best to the eyes of this fine, kindly old man.

When Colonel Ogilvie began to speak again there was a change in him.
He seemed more thoughtful, more cautious, more self-controlled;
altogether he was more like his old self. There was even a note of
geniality in his voice.

“What I want to ask you in especial is this: How can we avoid any sort
of scandal over this unhappy occurrence? My daughter has acted
thoughtlessly in going out alone in a motor with a gentleman. Through
a series of accidents it appears that that ride was unduly and
unintentionally prolonged, and ended in her being caught in a fog and
lost. By accident she came here, walking after the motor had broken
down. She slept last night in that room; and the man, who had also
found his way hither later, slept, unknowing of her proximity, in
this. I need not tell you that such a state of things is apt to lead
to a scandal. Now, and now only, is the time to prevent it” … He was
interrupted by the Sheriff who spoke hurriedly, as one who had already
considered the question and had his mind made up:

“There will be no scandal!” He spoke in so decided a way that the
other was impressed.

“How do you know? What ground have you for speaking so decidedly?”

“It rests entirely on you--yourself, Colonel Ogilvie.”

“What!” His tone was laden with both anger and surprise. “Do you think
I would spread any ill report of my own daughter? Sir, you must----”
Once more the Sheriff cut into his speaking:

“You misapprehend me, Colonel Ogilvie. You misapprehend me entirely.
Why should I--how could I think such a thing! No! I mean that if you
accept the facts as they seem to me to be, no one--not you, nor any
one else, can make scandal; if you do not!”

“Explain yourself,” he interrupted. “Nay, do not think me rude”--here
he put up a deprecating hand--“but I am so deeply anxious about my
daughter’s happiness--her future welfare and happiness,” he added as
he remembered how his violent attitude had, only a few minutes ago
imperilled--almost destroyed, that happiness. Joy had been, off and
on, whispering a word to her aunt so that the latter was now fairly
well posted in the late events.

“Quite so! quite so, my dear sir. Most natural thing in the world,”
said the Sheriff soothingly. “Usual thing under the circumstances is
to kill the man; or want to kill him!” As he spoke he looked at
Athlyne meaningly. The other understood and checked the words which
were rising to his lips. Then, having tided over the immediate danger
of explosion, the Sheriff went on:

“The fact is Colonel Ogilvie, that the series of doings (and perhaps
misdoings) and accidents, which have led to our all meeting here and
now, has brought about a strange conclusion. So far as I can
see”--here his manner grew grave and judicial--“these two young people
are at the present moment man and wife. Lawfully married according to
Scottish law!”

The reception of this dictum was varied. Colonel Ogilvie almost
collapsed in overwhelming amazement. Joy, blushing divinely, looked at
her husband adoringly. Athlyne seemed almost transfigured and
glorified; the realisation of all his hopes in this sudden and
unexpected way showed unmistakably how earnest they had been. Judy,
alone of all the party, was able to express herself in conventional
fashion. This she did by clapping her hands and, then by kissing the
whole party--except the Sheriff who half stood forward as though in
hope that some happy chance might include him in the benison. She
began with Joy and went on to her brother-in-law, who accepted with a
better grace than she feared would have been accorded. When she came
to Athlyne she hesitated for a moment, but with a “now-or-never” rush
completed the act, and fell back shyly with a belated timorousness.

The Sheriff, having paused for the completion of this little domestic
ceremony, went on calmly:

“Since I left you a few minutes ago I have busied myself with making a
few necessary inquiries from my old servant Jane McBean, now
McPherson. I made them, I assure you Colonel Ogilvie, very discreetly.
Even Jane, who is in her way a clever woman, has no suspicion that I
was even making inquiry. The result has been to confirm me in my
original conjecture, which was to the effect that there has been
executed between these two people an ‘irregular’ marriage!” At the
mention of the words the Colonel exploded:

“God’s death, sir, the women of the Ogilvies don’t make irregular
marriages!” The Sheriff went calmly on, only noticing the protest for
the sake of answering it.

By this time Joy and Judith were close together, holding hands.
Insensibly the girl drew her Aunt over to where Athlyne was standing
and took him by the arm. He raised his other hand and with it covered
the hand that lay on his arm, pressing it closer as he listened
attentively to the Sheriff’s expounding of the law:

“I gather that I did not express myself clearly when a short time ago
I spoke of the Scottish marriage laws. Let me now be more precise. And
as I am trying to put into words understandable by all a somewhat
complex subject I shall ask that no one present will make any remark
whatever till this part of my task has been completed. I shall then
answer to the best of my power any question or questions which any of
you may choose to ask me.

“Let me begin by assuring you all that what in Scottish law we call an
‘irregular’ marriage is equally binding in every way with a ‘regular’
marriage; the word only refers to form or method, and in no wise to
the antecedents or to the result. In our law ‘Mutual Consent’
constitutes marriage. You will observe that I speak of marriage--not
the proof of it. Proof is quite a different matter; and as it is
formally to be certified by a Court it is naturally hedged in by
formalities. This consent, whether proved or not, whether before
witnesses or not, should of course be followed by co-habitation; but
even this is not necessary. The dictum of Scots’ law is ‘_Concensus
non concubitus facit matrimonium_.’ But I have a shrewd suspicion that
the mind of the Court is helped to a declaration of validity when
_concensus_ has been followed by _concubitus_.

“Now let us take the present case and examine it as though testing it
in a Court of Law; for such is the true means to be exact. This man
and woman--we don’t know ‘gentleman’ and ‘lady’ in the Law--declared
in the presence of witnesses that they were man and wife. That is, the
man declared to the police sergeant at Dalry that the woman was his
wife; and the woman declared timeously to the police officer who made
the arrest that the man was her husband. These two statements,
properly set out, would in themselves be evidence not only of inferred
consent by declaration _de præsenti_ but of the same thing by ‘habit
and repute.’ The law has been thus stated:


“‘It may be held that a man and a woman, by living together and
holding themselves out as married persons, have sufficiently declared
their matrimonial consent; and in that case they will be declared to
be married although no specific promise of marriage or of _de
præsenti_ acknowledgement has been proved.’


“But there is a still more cogent and direct proof, should such be
required. Each of these consenting parties to the contract of
‘marriage by consent,’ on coming separately to this hotel last night
gave to the servant of the house who admitted them the name by which I
hold they are now bound in honourable wedlock!” He spoke the last
sentences gravely and impressively after the manner of an advocate
pressing home on a jury the conclusion of an elaborate train of
reasoning. Whilst speaking he had kept his eyes fixed on Colonel
Ogilvie, who unconsciously took it that an exhortation on patience and
toleration was being addressed to him. The effect was increased by the
action of Joy, who seeing him all alone and inferring his spiritual
loneliness, left Judith but still holding Athlyne’s arm drew the
latter towards him. Then she took her father’s arm and stood between
the two men whom she loved. Judy quietly took Athlyne’s other arm, and
so all stood in line holding each other as they faced the Sheriff. No
one said a word; all were afraid to break the silence.

“We now come to further proofs if such be required. The woman, who
arrived first, gave the name of Lady Athlyne.” Here Joy got fearfully
red; she was conscious of her father’s eyes on her, even before she
heard him say:

“That foolish joke again! Did not I forbid you to use it daughter?”
She felt it would be unwise to answer, to speak at all just at
present. In desperation she raised her eyes to the face of her
lover--and was struck with a sort of horrified amazement. For an
instant it had occurred to him that Joy must have known his
identity--for some time past at all events. The thought was, however,
but momentary. Her eyes fell again quickly, and she stood in abashed
silence. There was nothing to do now but to wait. The calm voice of
the Sheriff went on, like the voice of Doom:

“The man arrived later. He himself had wired in his own name for
rooms; but by the time he had arrived the possibility of his coming
had, owing to the fog, been given up. The other traveller had been
given the bedroom, and he slept on the sofa in the sitting-room--this
room.” As he spoke he went over to the door of communication between
the rooms and examined the door. There were no fastenings except the
ordinary latch; neither lock nor bolt. He did not say a word, but
walked back to his place. Judy could not contain her curiosity any
longer; she blurted out:

“What name did he give?” The Sheriff looked at her admiringly as he
answered:

“The name he gave, dear lady, was ‘Athlyne’!”

“Is that your name?” she queried--this time to Athlyne.

“It is!” He pulled himself up to his full height and stood on his
dignity as he said it. His name should not be dishonoured if he could
help it.

Colonel Ogilvie stood by with an air of conscious superiority. He
already knew the name from Athlyne’s letter, though he had not up to
that moment understood the full import of it. He was willing to be
further informed through Judy’s questioning.

“And you are Lord Athlyne--the Earl of Athlyne?”

“Certainly!”

To the astonishment of every one of the company Judy burst into a wild
peal of hysterical laughter. This closely followed a speech of broken
utterance which only some of those present understood at all--and of
those some only some few partly. “Athlyne!”--“kill him for
it!”--“calling herself by his name,”--“oh! oh! A-h-h!” There was a
prolonged screech and then hysterical laughter followed. At the first
this unseemly mirth created a feeling of repulsion in all who heard.
It seemed altogether out of place; in the midst of such a serious
conversation, when the lives and happiness of some of those present
were at stake, to have the train of thought broken by so inopportune a
cachinnation was almost unendurable. Colonel Ogilvie was furious. Well
was it for the possibilities of peace that his peculiar life and ideas
had trained him to be tolerant of woman’s weakness, and to be
courteous to them even under difficulties. For had he given any
expression to his natural enough feelings such would inevitably have
brought him into collision--intellectual if not physical--with both
Athlyne and the Sheriff; and either was to be deplored. Joy was in her
heart indignant, for several reasons. It was too hard that, just as
things were possibly beginning to become right and the fine edge of
tragedy to be turned, her father’s mind should be taken back to anger
and chagrin. But far beyond this on the side of evil was the fact that
it imperilled afresh the life of--of the man she loved, her … her
husband. Even the personal aspect to her could not be overlooked. The
ill-timed laughter prevented her hearing more of … of the man who it
now seemed was already her husband. However she restrained and
suppressed herself and waited, still silent, for the development of
things. But she did not consider looks as movements; she raised her
eyes to Athlyne’s adoringly, and kept them there. He in turn had been
greatly upset for the moment; even now, whilst those wild peals of
hysterical laughter continued to resound, he could not draw any
conclusions from the wild whirl of inchoate thoughts. There was just
one faint gleam of light which had its origin rather in instinct than
reason, that perhaps the interruption had its beneficial side which
would presently be made manifest. When Joy looked towards him there
was a balm for his troubled spirit. In the depths of her beautiful
eyes he lost himself--and his doubts and sorrows, and was content.

The only one unmoved was the Sheriff. His mental attitude allowed him
to look at things more calmly than did those personally interested.
With the exception of one phase--that of concern that this particular
woman, who had already impressed her charming personality on his
heart, should be in such distress--he could think, untroubled, of the
facts before him. With that logical mind of his, and with his
experience of law and the passions that lead to law-invoking, he knew
that the realization of Athlyne’s name and position was a troublesome
matter which might have been attended with disastrous consequences. To
a man of Colonel Ogilvie’s courage and strong passion the presence of
an antagonist worthy of his powers is rather an incentive to quarrel
than a palliative.

As to poor Judy she was in no position to think at all. She was to all
practical intents, except for the noise she was occasionally
making--her transport was subsiding--as one who is not. She continued
intermittently her hysterical phrenzy--to laugh and cry, each at the
top note--and commingling eternally. She struggled violently as she
sat on the chair into which she had fallen when the attack began; she
stamped her heels on the floor, making a sound like gigantic
castanets. The sound and restless movement made an embarrassing
_milieu_ for the lucid expression of law and entangled facts; but
through it all the Sheriff, whose purpose after all was to convince
Ogilvie, went on with his statement. By this time Joy, and Athlyne,
whom with an appealing look she had summoned to help, were
endeavouring to restore Judy. One at either side they knelt by her,
holding her hands and slapping them and exercising such other
ministrations as the girl out of her limited experience of such
matters could, happily to soothing effect, suggest. The Sheriff’s
voice, as calm voices will, came through the disturbance seemingly
unhindered:

“Thus you will note that in all this transaction the Earl of Athlyne
had made no disguise of his purpose. To the police who arrested him he
at once disclosed his identity, which the sergeant told me was
verified by the name on his motor-driver’s license. He telegraphed to
the hotel by his title--as is fitting and usual; and he gave his title
when he arrived. As I have already said, he stated to the police, at
first on his own initiative and later when interrogated directly on
the point, that the woman in the motor was his wife. And the identity
of the woman in the motor and the woman in the hotel can easily be
proved. Thus on the man’s part there is ample evidence of that
matrimonial purpose which the law requires. All this without counting
the letter to the woman’s father, in which he stated his wish and
intention to marry her.

“Now as to the woman--and I must really apologise to her for speaking
of the matter in her presence.”--Here Athlyne interrupted his
ministrations with regard to Judy in order to expostulate:

“Oh, I say Mr. Sheriff. Surely it is not necessary.” But the Sheriff
shut him up quite shortly. He had a purpose in so doing: he wished in
his secret heart to warn both Athlyne and Joy not to speak a word till
he had indicated that the time had come for so doing.

“There is nothing necessary, my Lord; except that both you and the
young lady should listen whilst I am speaking! I am doing so for the
good of you both; and I take it as promised that neither of you will
say a single word until I have told you that you may do so.”

“Quite right!” this was said _sotto voce_ by Colonel Ogilvie.

“You, young madam, have taken upon yourself the responsibilities of
wifehood; and it is right as well as necessary that you understand
them; such of them at least as have bearing upon the present
situation.

“As to the woman. She, when questioned by the police as to her status
for the purpose of verification of Lord Athlyne’s statement, accepted
that statement. Later on, she of her own free will and of her own
initiative, gave her name as Lady Athlyne--only the bearer of which
could be the wife of the Defender; I mean of Lord Athlyne.” The
interruption this time came from Colonel Ogilvie.

“If Lord Athlyne is Defender, who is the other party?”

“Lady Athlyne, or Miss Ogilvie, in whichever name she might take
action, would be the Pursuer!”

“Sir!” thundered the Colonel, going off as usual at half-cock, “do you
insinuate that my daughter is pursuer of a man?” He grew speechless
with indignation. The Sheriff’s coolness stood to him there, when the
fury of the Kentuckian was directed to him personally. In the same
even tone he went on speaking:

“I must ask--I really _must_ ask that you do not be so hasty in your
conclusions whilst I am speaking, Colonel Ogilvie. You must understand
that I am only explaining the law; not even giving any opinion of my
own. The terminology of Scot’s Law is peculiar, and differs from
English law in such matters. For instance what in English law is
‘Plaintiff and Defendant’ becomes with us ‘Pursuer and Defender.’
There may be a female as well as a male Pursuer. Thus on the grounds
of present consent as there is ample proof of Matrimonial Consent of
either and both parties--sufficient for either to use against the
other. I take it that the Court would hold the marriage proved; unless
_both_ parties repudiated the Intent. This I am sure would never be;
for if there were any mutual affection neither would wish to cause
such gossip as would inevitably ensue. And if either party preferred
that the union should continue, either from motives of love or
interest, the marriage could be held good. And I had better say at
once, since it is a matter to be considered by any parent, that should
there have been any valid ground for what you designate as ‘scandal,’
such would in the eyes of the law be only the proper and necessary
completion of the act of marriage. And let me say also that the fact
of the two parties, thus become one by the form of Irregular Marriage,
having passed the night in this suite of rooms without bolt of
fastening on the connecting door would be taken by a Court as proof of
consummation. No matter by what entanglement of events--no matter how
or by what accident or series of accidents the two parties came into
this juxtaposition!

“There is but one other point to be considered regarding the validity
of this marriage. It is that of compliance with the terms of Lord
Brougham’s Act of 1856. The man has undoubted domicile in Scotland for
certain legal purposes. But the marriage law requires a further and
more rigid reading of residence than mere possession of estates. The
words are that one of the parties to the marriage must ‘have his or
her usual place of residence’ in this Country. But as I have shown you
that in Lord Athlyne’s case his living in Scotland for several weeks
in one or other of his own houses would be certainly construed by any
Court as compliance with the Act, I do not think that any question of
legality could arise. Indeed it is within my own knowledge that as a
Scottish peer--Baron of Ceann-da-Shail--who declared Scottish domicile
on reaching his majority and whose ‘domicile of origin’ was not
affected by his absence as an officer in foreign service, his status
for the purpose of Scottish marriage is unassailable.

“In fine let me point out that I am speaking altogether of _proof_ of
the marriage itself. The actual marriage is in law the consent of the
parties; and such has undoubtedly taken place. The only possible
condition of its nullity would be the repudiation of the implied
Consent by both of the parties. One alone would not be sufficient!

“And now, Colonel Ogilvie, as I believe it will be well that you and
the two young people should consider the situation from this point of
view, will you allow me to withdraw--still on the supposition that you
will join me later at breakfast. And if this merry lady”--pointing to
Judy who had gained composure sufficiently to hear the end of his
explanation--“will honour me by coming to my sitting-room, just below
this, where breakfast will be served, it may perhaps be better. I take
it that you will be all able to speak more freely, you and your
daughter--and her husband!”

He withdrew gracefully, giving his arm to Judy who having risen
bashfully had taken his extended arm. She was blushing furiously.

The door closed behind him, leaving Joy standing between her father
and Athlyne, and holding an arm of each.




 CHAPTER XXII.
 THE HATCHET BURIED

For a few minutes there was silence in the room; silence so profound
that every sound of the street was clearly heard. Even the shutting of
the Sheriff’s door in the room below was distinct.

The first to speak was Colonel Ogilvie. Athlyne, who would have liked
to break the silence refrained through prudence; he feared that were
he to speak before Colonel Ogilvie did, that easily-irate gentleman
might take offence. He knew that this might be disastrous, for it
would renew the old strife in an acute form; as it was, there were
distinct indications of coming peace. Joy, and Joy alone, was to be
thought of now. By this time Athlyne was beginning to get the measure
of Colonel Ogilvie’s foot. He realised that the dictatorial,
vindictive, blood-thirsty old man would perhaps do much if left to
himself; but that if hindered or thwarted or opposed in any way his
pride or his vanity--and they were united in him--would force him to
keep his position at any cost.

“Well, sir?” The tone was so peremptory and so “superior” that any man
to whom it had been used might well have taken offence; but Athlyne
was already schooled to bear, and moreover the statement made by the
Sheriff filled his heart with such gladness that he felt that he could
bear anything. As Joy was now his wife he _could_ not quarrel with her
father--nor receive any quarrel from him. Still, all the same, he felt
that he must support and maintain his own independent position; such
would be the best road to ultimate peace. Moreover, he had his own
pride; and as he had already made up his mind to die if need be for
Joy’s sake, he could not go back on that resolution without seeming to
be disloyal to her. There would--could--be no hiding anything from her
as she had already heard the whole of the quarrel and of his
acquiescence to her father’s challenge. No one, however, would have
thought he had any quarrel who heard his reply, spoken in exquisitely
modulated accents of respect:

“Need I say, Colonel Ogilvie, that I am equally proud and happy in
finding myself allied with your House by my marriage with your
daughter. For, sir, I love her with all my soul, as well as with all
my heart and mind. She is to me the sweetest, dearest and best thing
in all the universe. I am proud of her and respect her as much as I
love her; and to you, her father, I hope I may say that I bless--and
shall ever bless for so long as I live--the day that I could call her
mine.” As he spoke, Joy’s hand on his arm, which had trembled at the
beginning, now gripped him hard and firmly. Turning his eyes to hers
he saw in them a look of adoration which made his heart leap and his
blood seem on fire. The beautiful eyes fell for an instant as a red
tide swept her face and neck; but in an instant more they were raised
to his eyes and hung there, beaming with pride and love and happiness.
This nerved and softened him at once, to even a gentler feeling
towards the old man; those lovely eyes had always looked trustingly
and lovingly into her father’s, and he would never disturb--so he
vowed to himself--if he could avoid it by any sacrifice on his part,
such filial and parental affection. And so, with gentler voice and
softened mien, he went on speaking.

“Now I must ask you to believe, sir, that with the exception of that
one fault--a grave one I admit--of taking Miss Ogilvie out alone in my
motor I have not willingly or consciously been guilty of any other
disrespect towards you. You now understand, of course, that it was
that unhappy assumed name which prevented my having the pleasure of
visiting you and your family on this side of the Atlantic. No one can
deplore more than I do that unhappy alias. The other, though I
regret--and regret deeply--the pain it has caused, I cannot be sorry
for, since it has been the means of making Joy my wife.”

Here he beamed down into the beautiful grey eyes of the said wife who
was still holding his arm. As he finished she pinched gently the flesh
of his arm. This sent a thrill through him; it was a kiss of sorts and
had much the same effect as the real thing. Joy noted the change in
his voice as he went on:

“I so respected your wishes, sir, that I did not actually ask in words
Joy to be my wife until I should have obtained your permission to
address myself to her. If you will look at that letter you will see
that it was written at Ceann-da-Shail, my place in Ross-shire--days
before I posted it.”

“Then if you did not ask her to marry you; how is it that you are now
married--according to the Sheriff?” He thought this a poser, and
beamed accordingly. Athlyne answered at once:

“When two people love each other, sir, as Joy and I do, speech is the
least adequate form of expression. We did not want words; we knew!”
Again Joy squeezed his arm and they stood close together in a state of
rapture. The Colonel, with some manifest hesitation, said:

“With regard to what the Sheriff spoke of as ‘real cause of scandal,’
was there. …?”

“That, sir,” said Athlyne interrupting with as fierce and truculent an
aspect as had been to the Colonel at any moment of the interview “is a
subject on which I refuse to speak, even to you.” Then after a pause
he added:

“This I will say to you as her father who is entitled to hear it:
Joy’s honour is as clear and stainless as the sunlight. Whatever has
taken place has been my doing, and I alone am answerable for it.”
Whilst he was speaking Joy stood close to him, silent and with
downcast eyes. In the prolonged silence which ensued she raised them,
and letting go Athlyne’s arm stepped forward towards her father with
flashing eyes:

“Father what he says is God’s truth. But there is one other thing
which you should know, and you must know it from me since he will not
speak. He is justified in speaking of my honour, for it was due--and
due alone--to his nobility of character that I am as I am. That and
your unexpected arrival. For my part I would have----”

“Joy!” Athlyne’s voice though the tone was low, rang like a trumpet.
Half protest it was, half command. Instinctively the woman recognised
the tone and obeyed, as women have obeyed the commands of the men they
loved, and were proud to do so, from Eden garden down the ages.

“Speak on, daughter! Finish what you were saying.” His voice was
strangely soft and his eyes were luminous beneath their shaggy white
brows. Joy’s answering tone was meek:

“I cannot, father. My … Mr.--Lord Athlyne desires that I should be
silent.” She was astonished at his reply following:

“Well, perhaps he is right. Better so!” Then in _sotto voce_ to
Athlyne:

“Women should not be allowed to talk sometimes. They go too far when
they get to self-abasement!” Athlyne nodded. Again silence which
Colonel Ogilvie broke:

“Well, sir. I suppose we must take it that the marriage is complete in
Scotch law. So far for the past. What of the future?” In a low voice
Athlyne replied:

“Whose future?”

“Yours--yours and my daughter’s.” He was amazed at Athlyne’s reply,
spoken in a voice both low and sad: so too was Joy:

“Of that I cannot say. It does not rest with me.”

“Not rest with you, sir? Then with whom does it rest.” Athlyne raised
his eyes and looked him straight in the face:

“With you!”

“With me?” the Colonel’s voice was faint with amazement.

“Yes, with you! What future have I, already condemned to death! What
future has my wife, whose sentence of widowhood came even before the
knowledge of her marriage! Do you forget Colonel Ogilvie that my life
is pledged to you? On your own doing, I took that obligation; but
having taken it I must abide by it. Such future as may be for either
of us rests with you!” Colonel Ogilvie did not pause before answering.
He spoke quickly as one whose mind is made up:

“But that is all over.” Athlyne said quietly:

“You had not said so! In an affair of this kind the challenged man is
not free to act. Pacific overture must be with the one who considering
himself injured has sought this means of redress.” Joy listening, with
her heart sinking and her hand so trembling that she took it from his
arm lest it should upset him, was amazed. He was at least as
determined as her father. But she was rejoiced to see that his
stiffness was having its effect; her father was evidently respecting
this very quality so much that he was giving way to his opponent.
Seeing this, and recognising in her woman’s way for the first time in
her life this fundamental force, she made up her mind that she too
would on her side keep steadfastly to her convictions just as … as
… He had done. In silence she waited for what would follow this new
development going on before her eyes. Presently Colonel Ogilvie spoke:

“I suppose Lord Athlyne you are satisfied with the validity of the
marriage?” He answered heartily:

“Of course I am! The Sheriff was quite clear about it; and what he
says is sufficient for me.”

“And your intention?”

“Sir, from the first moment when my eyes lit on your daughter I had
only one intention, and that was to make her my wife. Be quite
satisfied as to me! I am fixed as Fate! If there is any hindrance to
my wishes it can only come from my wife. But understand this: that if
for any cause whatever she may wish this marriage annulled, or
consider that it has not been valid, she has only to indicate her wish
and I shall take any step in my power to set her free.”

“Father!” Colonel Ogilvie turned in astonishment at the sound of his
daughter’s voice, which was in such tone as he had never heard from
her. It rang; her mind was made up:

“Father, a while ago when you seemed in some grave trouble I asked you
why you did not ask me anything. I told you I had never lied to you
and should not do so then; but you asked me nothing. Why don’t you ask
me now?”

“What should I ask you, little girl. You are married; and your duty is
to some one else whose name you bear. Besides, I don’t ask women
questions which may be painful to answer. Such I ask of men!”

To this she spoke in a calm voice which made Athlyne uneasy. He could
not imagine what she was coming at; but he felt that whatever it might
be it was out of the truth of her nature, and that he must support
her. Her love he never doubted. In the meantime he must listen
patiently and learn what she had to say.

“Well father, as you will not ask I must speak unasked. It is harder;
that is all. The Sheriff said that mutual intention was necessary for
marriage. Let me tell you that I had not then such intention! I must
say it. I have never lied to you yet; and I don’t intend to begin now.
Especially when I am entering on a new life with a man whom I love and
honour. For if this marriage be not good we shall soon have one that
is--if he will have me.” Athlyne took her hand; she sighed joyfully as
she went on:

“I certainly did intend to marry Mr. … Lord Athlyne when … when he
should formally ask me; but I understood then that there was some
obstacle to his doing so. This I now know to be that he was wanting to
get your consent beforehand. But if I did not then intend that our
coming for a run in the motor together was to be marriage, how can I
by that act be married?” As she paused Athlyne realised what was the
cause of that vague apprehension which had chilled him. Colonel
Ogilvie was beset by a new difficulty by this new attitude of Joy. If
she repudiated intention such would nullify the marriage, since
Athlyne had signified his intention of letting her have her way. If
there were no marriage, then there would be scandal. So before
beginning to argue with his daughter on the subject of the validity of
the marriage, he thought it well to bring to the aid of reason the
forces of fear. He commenced by intimidation:

“Of course you understand, daughter, that if you and Lord Athlyne were
not married through the accidents of your escapade, there will be
scandal from it; there is no other alternative. In that case, such
pacific measures as I have now acceded to will be abrogated; and the
gentleman who was the cause of the evil must still answer to me for
it.” At this threat Joy grew ghastly pale. Athlyne, wrung to the heart
by it, forgot his intention of discretion and said quickly and
sharply:

“That is not fair, Colonel Ogilvie. She is a woman--if she _is_ your
daughter, and is not to be treated brutally. You must not strike at a
man through a woman. If you want to strike a man do so direct! I am
the man. Strike me, how and when you will; but this woman is my
wife--at least she is until she repudiates our marriage! But till then
by God! no man--not even her father himself--shall strike her or at
her, or through her!” Both he and Joy were surprised at the meek way
in which the old man received this tirade. But even whilst he had been
uttering the cruel threat both his conscience and his courage had been
against him. This, the man and the woman who heard could, from
evidence, divine. But there was another cause of which they had no
knowledge. The moment after speaking, when his blind passion began to
cool, the last words of his wife came back to his memory: “Be good to
her, and never forget that she can suffer most through any one dear to
her.” Furthermore, the recollection of Judy’s words as he was leaving
clinched the matter: “You hold poor Joy’s life--which is her heart--in
your hand!” He began his reply to Athlyne truculently--as was usual to
him; but melted quickly as he went on:

“Hey-day my young bantam-cock; you flash your spurs boldly. … But I
don’t know but you’re right. I was wrong; I admit it! Joy my dear I
apologise for it; and to you too, sir, who stand up so valiantly and
so readily for your wife. I am glad my little girl has such a
defender; though it is and will be a sad thought to me that I was
myself the first to cause its evidence. But keep your hair on, young
man! Men sometimes get hurt by running up against something that’s
quite in its right place. … It’s my place to look after my little
girl--till such time as you have registered your bond-rights. And see,
doesn’t she declare she had no idea she was being married. However,
it’s all right in this case. I don’t mean her to give herself away
over this part of the job any more than you did a while ago when you
stopped her telling me something that it wouldn’t have been wise to
say. So, sir, guess we’ll call it quits this time. Well, little girl,
let me tell you that you’ve said all at once to me two different
things. You said you _didn’t_ intend to marry Lord Athlyne that time,
but that you _did_ at some other. If that last doesn’t make an
intention to marry I’m a Dutchman. I think we’d better let it rest at
that! Now as to you Lord Athlyne! You seem to want--and rightly enough
I’ll allow--that I make a formal retraction of my demand for your
life. Well I do so now. There’s my hand! I can give it to you freely,
for you are a brave man and you love my little girl; and my little
girl loves you. I’m right sorry I didn’t know you at the first as I do
now. But I suppose the fact is, I was jealous all along. You don’t
know--yet--what I know: that you were thrown at me in a lot of ways
before I ever saw you, by the joke that my little girl and Judy put up
on me. When I knew that my girl was calling herself by your name. …”

“Daddy dear!” This was Joy’s protest. “Yes, little girl, I won’t give
you away; but your husband should know this fact lest he keep a grudge
in his heart against your old daddy--and I know you wouldn’t like
that. You can tell him, some of these days or nights, what you like
yourself about the whole thing from the first. I dare say he’ll want
to know, and won’t let you alone till you tell him. And I dare say not
then; for he’ll like--he’s bound to--all you can say. Here, Athlyne--I
suppose that’s what I am to call you since you’re my son now--at any
rate my daughter’s husband.” As he spoke he held out his hand. Athlyne
jumped forward and seized it warmly. The two men shook hands as do two
strong men who respect each other. Joy stepped forward and took the
clasped hands between her own. When the hands parted she kissed her
husband and then her father; she had accepted the situation.

After a pause Athlyne said, quietly but with a very resolute look on
his face:

“I understand, sir, that the hatchet is now buried. But I want to say
that this must be final. I do so lest you should ever from any cause
wish to dig it up again. Oh, yes I understand”--for the Colonel was
going to speak “but I have had a warning. Just now when it seemed that
Joy was going to repudiate--though happily as it turned out for only a
time--our marriage as an existing fact, you re-opened that matter
which I had then thought closed. Now as for the future Joy’s happiness
is my duty as well as my privilege and my pleasure, I must take all
precautions which I can to insure it. It would not do if she could
ever have in her mind a haunting fear that you and I could quarrel. I
know that for my own part I would be no party to a quarrel with you.
But I also have reason to know that a man’s own purpose is nothing
when some one else wants to quarrel with him. Therefore for our dear
Joy’s sake----”

“Good!” murmured the Colonel. “_Our_ dear Joy’s sake!” Athlyne
repeated the phrase--he loved to do so:

“For our dear Joy’s sake will you not promise that you will never
quarrel with me.”

“Indeed I will give the promise--and more. Listen here, little girl,
for it is for your sake. I find I have been wrong to quarrel so
readily and without waiting to understand. If a nigger did it I think
I’d understand, for I don’t look for much from him. But I do expect
much from myself; and therefore I’ll go back a bit and go a bit
farther. Hear me promise, so help me God, I’ll never quarrel again!
Quarrel to kill I mean of course. Now, sir, are you satisfied!” Joy
flung herself into his arms cooing lovingly:

“Dear, dear Daddy. Oh thank you so much; you have made me so happy!
That promise is the best wedding-gift you could possibly give me!”
Athlyne took the hand extended to him and wrung it heartily:

“And I too, thank you, sir. And, as I want to share in all Joy’s
happiness and in her pleasant ways, I hope you will let me--as her
husband--call you Daddy too?”

“Indeed you may, my boy; I’ll be right glad!”

It was a happy trio that stood there, the two men’s right hands
clasping, and Joy once more holding the linked hands between hers.

“We may go join the Sheriff and Judy I think, little girl!” said the
Colonel presently. He felt that he wanted to get back to himself from
the unaccustomed atmosphere of sentiment which encompassed him.

“Just one moment--Daddy!” said Athlyne speaking the familiar name with
an effort and looking at Joy as he did so. The approval shining from
her beautiful eyes encouraged him, and he went on more freely:

“Now that our dear Joy is my care I should like to make a proposition.
The Sheriff’s suggestion is good, and his reading of the law seems as
if it were all right; but, after all, there is no accounting for what
judges and juries may decide. Now I want--and we all want--that there
be no doubt about this marriage--now or hereafter. And I therefore
suggest that presently Joy and I shall again exchange Matrimonial
Intention and Consent, or whatever is the strongest way that can be
devised to insure a flawless marriage. We can even write this down and
both sign it, and you and the Sheriff and Judy shall witness. So that
whatever has been before--though this will not disturb it--will be
made all taut and secure!” Joy’s comment was:

“And I shall be married to my husband a second time!”

“Yes, darling” said Athlyne putting his arm round her and drawing her
close to him. She came willingly and put her arms round him. They
embraced and kissed each other and he said:

“Yes darling; but wait a moment, I have a further suggestion. In
addition to this we can have a ‘regular’ marriage to follow these two
irregular ones. I shall go to London and get a special license from
the Archbishop of Canterbury, who is a connection of my own. With this
we shall have a religious marriage to supplement the civil ones. We
can be married, sir, in your own rooms, or in a church, just as Joy
wishes--and, of course, as her mother and her Daddy wish. We can be
married the third time, Joy darling, in Westminster Abbey if you so
desire!”

“Anywhere you choose--darling!” she spoke the last word shyly “will be
what I wish. I am glad I am to be married three times to you.”

“Why darling?”

“Because darling” she spoke the word now without shyness or
hesitation. “I love you enough for three husbands; and now we must
have three honeymoons!” she danced about the room gaily, clapping her
hands like a happy child.

When they were ready to go to breakfast Colonel Ogilvie instinctively
offered his arm to Joy, but catching sight of Athlyne drew back and
motioned to him to take the honourable place. The husband was pleased,
but seeing a new opening for conciliation he said heartily:

“No, no. I hope the time will never come when my wife won’t love to go
with her father!” The old man was pleased and called to his daughter:

“Come, little girl, you have got to take us both!” She took her
husband’s arm as well as her father’s; and all three moved towards the
door. When they got there, however, some change was necessary, for it
was not possible to pass through three abreast. Each of the men was
willing to give place to the other; but before either man could move,
or indeed before either had his mind made up what to do, the
quicker-witted woman slipped back behind them. There taking Athlyne’s
hand in hers she had placed it on her father’s arm. As they both were
about to protest against going in front of her she said hastily:

“Please, please Daddy and … Husband I would really rather you two
went first, and arm in arm as father and son should go. For that is
what it is to be from this on; isn’t it? I would rather a thousand
times see the two men I love best in all the world going so, than walk
in front of them as a Queen.”

“That’s very prettily said!” was the comment of her father. Then with
a fond look back at her he took the young man’s hand from his own arm
and placed his own hand on the other’s arm. “That’s better!” he said.
“Age leaning on Youth, and Beauty smiling on both!”

And in this wise they entered the Sheriff’s room, in time to see him
sitting at one end of the sofa and Judy sitting at the furthest corner
away from him--blushing.




 CHAPTER XXIII.
 A HARMONY IN GRAY

As the trio entered the room Judy jumped from the sofa vivaciously.
The Sheriff followed with an agility wonderful in a man of his age; he
bade them all welcome with a compelling heartiness. Judy was full of
animation; indeed she out-did herself to a degree which made Joy raise
her eyebrows. Joy was a sympathetic soul, and unconsciously adapted
herself to her Aunt’s supra-vivacity.

To Colonel Ogilvie, less enthusiastic by nature and concern, it
appeared that she was as he put it in his own mind “playing up to the
old girl.” He seemed to realise that the Sheriff was ardent in his
intentions; and, with the calm, business-like aptitude of a
brother-in-law to a not-young lady, had already made up his mind to
give his consent.

Judy flew to Joy and kissed her fervently. The kisses were returned
with equal warmth, and the two women rocked in each other’s arms, to
the envy, if delight, of certain of the onlookers viewing the
circumstance from different standpoints. Judy took her niece to the
now-vacated sofa, and an animated whispering began between them. Joy’s
attention was, however, distracted; her senses had different
objectives. Her touch was to Judy sitting beside her and holding her
close in a loving embrace; her ears were to her father who was talking
to the Sheriff. But her eyes were all with her husband, devouring him.
There came a timid knock at the door, and in answer to the Sheriff’s
“Come in,” it was partly opened. The voice of the landlady was heard:
“May I speak with ye a moment, Sheriff?” He went over to the door, and
a whispered colloquy ensued, all his guests turning their eyes away
and endeavouring in that way, as usual, to seem not to be listening.
Then the Sheriff, having closed the door, said:

“Our good hostess tells me that there will be a full half hour of
waiting before we can breakfast, if she is to have proper time to do
justice to the food which she wishes to place before us. So I must ask
pardon of you all.”

“Capital! Capital!” said Colonel Ogilvie, “that half hour is just what
we want. Mr. Sheriff, we have a little ceremony to go through before
we breakfast. The fact is we are going to have an Irregular Marriage.
If you are able to take part in such a thing I hope you will assist
us.” Joy rose up and stood beside Athlyne. The Sheriff answered:

“Be quite easy on that point, sir. I am not in my own shrieval
district, and so, even if such were contra to my duties at home, I am
free to act as an individual elsewhere. But who are the contracting
parties? You are married already; so too are your daughter and my Lord
Athlyne. Indeed it looks, Miss Hayes, as if you and I are the only
available parties left. But I fear such great happiness is not for me;
though I would give anything in the wide world to win it!” He bowed to
her gallantly and took her hand. She looked quite embarrassed--though
not distressed, and giggled like a schoolgirl.

“Indeed, Mr. Sheriff!” she said, “this is very sudden. Affairs of the
heart seem to move quickly in this delightful country!” As she spoke
she looked at Joy and Athlyne who happened to be at the moment
standing hand in hand. Joy came over and sat beside her and kissed
her. Athlyne, in obedience to a look from his wife, kissed her too.
Then the Colonel gallantly followed suit. There was only the Sheriff
left, and he, after a pause, took advantage of the occasion and kissed
her also. Then to relieve her manifest embarrassment he spoke out:

“I fear I have diverted your purpose, Colonel Ogilvie. I am not sorry
for it”--this with a look at Judy which made her blush afresh “but I
apologize. I take it that you were alluding to something in which I am
to have a less prominent part than I have suggested.”

“The marriage, sir, is to be between Lord Athlyne and my daughter.” As
he spoke Athlyne went to a side table whereon were spread the
Sheriff’s writing materials. He took a sheet of paper and began to
write. Colonel Ogilvie went on:

“We have come to the conclusion that, though the act of marriage which
has already taken place between these two young people is in your view
lawful and complete, it may be well to go through the ceremony in a
more formal manner. There are, we all know, intricacies and pitfalls
in law; and we are both agreed with the suggestion of my lord that it
would be well not to allow any loophole for after attack. Therefore in
your presence--if you will be so good,” the Sheriff bowed, “they shall
again pledge their mutual Matrimonial Consent. They will both sign the
paper to that effect which I see Lord Athlyne is preparing; and we
shall all sign it as witnesses. Then, when this new marriage is
complete--and irrefragable as I understand from what you said awhile
ago it will be--we shall be ready for breakfast. It will be more than
perhaps you expected when you so kindly asked us to be your guests: a
wedding breakfast!”

Judy whispered to her niece.

“Joy, you must come to your room and let me dress you properly. I have
brought a dress with me.”

“What dress dear?” she asked.

“The tweed tailor-made.”

“But, Judy dear, I have on a white frock, and that is more suitable
for my wedding.”

“That was all right yesterday, dear. But to-day you shall not wear
white. You are already a married lady; this is only a re-marriage.” A
beautiful blush swept over Joy’s face as she looked at her husband
writing away as hard as his pen could move.

“I shall wear white to-day!” she said in the same whisper, and stood
up.

Just at that moment a fly drove quickly past the window. It stopped at
the hotel door, and there was a sudden bustle of arrival. Voices
raised to a high pitch were heard outside. Various comments were heard
in the room.

“That’s mother!”

“My wife!”

“Sally!”

“Why Aunt Judy that’s the voice of Mrs. O’Brien!”

“My Foster-mother!”

The door opened, and in swept Mrs. Ogilvie who flew first to her
husband’s arms; and then, after a quick embrace, seemed to close round
Joy and obliterate her. A similar eclipse took place with regard to
Athlyne; for Mrs. O’Brien dashed into the room and calling out as
though invoking the powers of earth and heaven: “Me bhoy! me bhoy!”
fell upon him. He seemed really glad to see her, and yielded himself
to her embrace as freely as though he had been a child again.

“Joy dear,” said Mrs. Ogilvie “I hope you are all right. After your
father and then Judy had gone, I was so anxious about you, that I got
the north mail stopped and caught it at Penrith. Just as I was going
to get ready for the journey Mrs. O’Brien came in. She had written to
me in London that she would like to pay her respects, and I had said
we were going on to Ambleside but would be glad if she would come and
see us there and spend a few days with us.” Mrs. O’Brien who was all
ears, here cut into the conversation:

“Aye, an Miss Joy acushla,--my service to ye miss!--she sent me postal
ordhers to cover me railway fare an me expinces. Oh! the kind heart iv
her!”

She had by now released Athlyne and stood back from him pointing at
him as she spoke:

“An comin’ here through yer ladyship’s goodness who do I find but me
beautiful bhoy. Luk at him! Luk at him! Luk at him!” Her voice rose in
crescendo at each repetition. “The finest, dearest, sweetest, bonniest
child that ever a woman tuk to her breast. An now luk at him well. The
finest, up-standinest, handsomest, dearest, lovinest man that the
whole wurrld houlds. That doesn’t forget his ould fosther mother an
him an Earrll, wid castles iv his own, an medals on to him an Victory
Crasses. An it’s a gineral he ought to be. Luk at him, God bless him!”
She turned to one after another of the party in turn as though
inviting their admiration. Joy came and, putting her arms round the
old woman’s neck, hugged and kissed her. When she got free, Mrs.
O’Brien said to Athlyne:

“An phwat are ye doin’ here me darlin’ acushla me lord--av I may make
so bould as t’ ask ye? How did ye come here; and phwat brung ye that
yer ould nurse might have her eyes made glad wid sight iv ye?”

“I am here, my dear, because I am married to Joy Ogilvie, and we are
going to be married again!”

Then the storm of comment broke, all the women speaking at once and in
high voices suitable to a momentous occasion:

“What, what?” said Mrs. Ogilvie. “Married to my daughter! Colonel
Ogilvie, how is it that I was not informed of this coming event?”

“Faith, my dear I don’t know” he answered “I never knew it--and--and I
believe they didn’t know it themselves … till the moment before it
was done.” He added the last part of the sentence in deference to the
Sheriff’s direction as to ‘intention.’ Fortunately the Sheriff had not
heard his remark.

“Do explain yourself, Lucius. I am all anxiety.”

“My dear, yesterday Joy made an irregular marriage with Lord Athlyne!”

“Good God!” The exclamation gave an indication of the social value of
“irregular” marriage to persons unacquainted with Scottish law. Her
husband saw that she was pained and tried to reassure her:

“You need not distress yourself, my dear. It is all right. ‘Irregular’
is only a name for a particular form of marriage in this Country. It
is equally legal with any other marriage.”

“But who is Lord Athlyne, and where is he? That is the name of the man
who Mrs. O’Brien told Joy was the only man good enough for her.”

“Lord Athlyne” said Colonel Ogilvie “at present our son-in-law, is
none other than Mr. Richard Hardy with whom you shook hands just now!”

“Lucius, I am all amazed! There seems to be a sort of network of
mystery all round us. But one thing: if Joy was married yesterday how
on earth can she be going to be married to-day?”

“To avoid the possibility of legal complications later on! It is all
right, my dear. You may take it from me that there is no cause for
concern! But there were certain things, usually attended to
beforehand, which on this occasion--owing to ignorance and hurry and
unpremeditation--were not attended to. In order to prevent the
possibility of anything going wrong by any quibble, they are to be
married again just now.”

“Where? when?”

“Here, in this room!”

“But where’s the clergyman; where is the license?”

“There is neither. This is a Scottish marriage! Later on we can have a
regular church marriage with a bishop if you wish or an archbishop; in
a church or a room or a Cathedral--just as you prefer.” Mrs. Ogilvie
perceptibly stiffened as he spoke. Then she said, with what she
thought was dignified gravity, which seemed to others like frigid
acidity:

“Do I understand, Colonel Ogilvie, that you are a consenting party to
another ‘irregular’”--she quivered as she said the word--“marriage?
And that my daughter is to be made a laughing stock amongst all our
acquaintances by _three_ different marriages?”

“That is so, my dear. It is for Joy’s good!”

“Her good? Fiddlesticks! But in that case I have nothing more to say!”
Some of her wrath seemed to be turned on both Athlyne and Joy; for she
did not say a single word to either of them. She simply relapsed into
stony silence.

Mrs. O’Brien’s reception of the news afforded what might be termed the
“comic relief” of the strained situation. She raised her hands, as
though in protest to heaven for allowing such a thing, and emitted a
loud wail such as a “keener” raises at an Irish wake. Then she burst
into voluble speech:

“Oh wirrasthrue me darlin’ bhoy, is it a haythen Turk y’ are becomin’,
to take another wife whin ye’ve got one already only a day ould. An
such a wan more betoken--the beautifullest darlinest young cratur what
iver I seen! Her that I picked out long ago as the only wan that ye
was good enough for. Shure, couldn’t ye rist content wid Miss Joy, me
darlin’? It’s lookin’ forward I was to nursin’ her childher, as I
nursed yerself me lord darlin’, her childher, an yours! An’ now it’s
another woman steppin’ in betune ye; an’ maybe there’ll be no childher
at all, at all. Wirrasthrue!”

“But look here, Nanny,” said Athlyne with some impatience. “Can’t you
see that you’re all wrong. It is to Joy that I am going to marry
again! There’s no other woman coming in between us. ’Tis only the dear
girl herself!”

“Ah, that’s all very well, me lord darlin’; but which iv them is to be
the mother? Faix but I’ll go an ax her Ladyship this minit!” And go
she did, to Athlyne’s consternation and Joy’s embarrassment. All in a
hurry she started up and went over to the sofa where Joy sat, and with
a bob curtesy said to her:

“Me lady, mayn’t I have the nursin’ av yer childher, the way I had
their father before them? Though, be the same token, it’s not the same
nursin’ I can give thim, wid me bein’ ould an’ rhun dhry!” Joy felt
that the only thing to do was to postpone the difficulty to a more
convenient season, when there should not be so many eyes--some of them
strange ones--on her. To do this as kindly and as brightly as she
could, she said:

“But dear Mrs. O’Brien, isn’t it a little soon to think--or at any
rate to speak--of such things?”

“Wasn’t ye married yisterday?” interrupted the old woman. But looking
at her lady’s cheeks she went on in a different tone:

“But me darlin’--Lady, it’s over bould an’ too contagious for me to
mintion such things, as yit. But I’ll take, if I may, a more
saysonable opportunity to ask ye to patthernise me. Some time whin
ye’re more established as a wife thin ye are now!”

“Indeed” said Joy kindly. “I shall only be too happy to have you near
me. And if I--if we are ever blessed with a little son I hope you will
try to teach him to be as like his----” she stopped, blushing, but
after a short pause went on “as like my dear husband as ever you can!”
There was a break in her voice which moved the old woman strongly. She
lifted the slim fine young hand to her withered lips and kissed it
fervently.

“Glory be to God! me Lady, but it’s the proud woman I’ll be to keep
and guard the young Earrll. An’ I’ll give my life for him if needs
be!”

“Come now!” said the Sheriff who had been speaking with Colonel
Ogilvie and Athlyne, and who had read over the paper written by the
latter. “Come now all you good people! All sit round the room except
you two principals to this solemn contract. You two stand before me
and read over the paper. You, my Lord, read it first; and then you
too, my Lady, do the same!” They sat round as they wished. Joy and
Athlyne stood up before the Sheriff, who was also standing.
Instinctively they took hands, and Athlyne holding the paper in his
left hand, read as follows:


“We Calinus Patrick Richard Westerna Mowbray Hardy Fitzgerald, Earl of
Athlyne, Viscount Roscommon and Baron Ceann-da-Shail and Joy
Fitzgerald or Ogilvie late of Airlville in the State of Kentucky,
United States of America, agree that we shall be and are united in the
solemn bonds of matrimony according to the Law of Scotland and that we
being of one mind as to the marriage, are and hereby declare ourselves
man and wife.

_Witness of above_

We the undersigned hereby declare that we have in the presence of the
above signatories and of each other seen the foregoing signatures
appended to this deed by the signatories themselves in our presence
and in the presence of each other.

Alexander Fenwick (Sheriff of Galloway).

Lucius Ogilvie (father of the bride).

Mary Hayes Ogilvie (mother of the bride).

Bedelia Ann O’Brien, widow (formerly nurse and foster mother to the
bridegroom).

Judith Hayes (aunt of the bride).”


When the document was completed by the signatures the Sheriff, having
first scanned it carefully, offered it to Colonel Ogilvie, who raising
a protesting hand said:

“No, no, Mr. Sheriff! I think we should all prefer that it should be
kept in your custody, if you will so oblige us.”

“With the greatest pleasure” he said; and Athlyne and Joy having
consented to the scheme he folded the document and put it into his
pocket. Just then the landlady, having knocked and being bidden to
enter, came into the room followed by several maids and men bearing
dishes.

“And now to breakfast” he went on. “Will the Bride kindly sit on my
right hand, with her Husband next her. Mrs. Ogilvie, will you honour
me by sitting on my left, with Colonel Ogilvie to support you on the
other side. Miss Hayes will you kindly sit on Lord Athlyne’s right.”
“And Mrs. … Mrs. O’Brien,” whispered Judy. He went on:

“Mrs. O’Brien will you sit on Colonel Ogilvie’s left.”

“’Deed an’ I’ll not!” said the Irishwoman sturdily.

“Do you mean” asked Colonel Ogilvie icily “that you do not care to sit
next to me individually?”

“Faix an’ I don’t mane anything so foolish yer ’ann’r. Why should the
likes o’ me dar to object to the likes iv you? All I mane, sorr, is
that an ould Biddy like me isn’t fit to sit down alongside the
quality--let alone an Earrll and his Laady whose unborn childher I’m
to nurse. An’, more betoken, on such an owdacious occasion--shure an I
don’t mane that but such a suspicious occasion.”

“Mrs. O’Brien ma’am” said the Sheriff taking her hand “you’re going, I
hope to take your place at the table that all these good friends wish
you to take.”

“In troth no yer”--whispering to Joy “what’s a Sheriff called Miss
Joy? Is he ‘yer Majesty’ or ‘me lord’ or ‘yer ann’r’ or what is he
anyhow?” “I think he is ‘yer honour’” said Joy. So Mrs. O’Brien
continued: “Yer Ann’r. Don’t ask me fur to sit down wid the quality
where I don’t belong. But let me give a hand to these nice girrls and
byes to shling the hash. Shure it’s a stewardess I am, an accustomed
to shovin’ the food.”

“Nanny” said Athlyne kindly but in a strong voice “we all want you to
sit at table with us to-day. And I hope you won’t refuse us that
pleasure.”

“Certainly me darlin’ lord!” she said instantly. “In coorse what
plases ye!” The Master had spoken; she was content to obey without
question. In the meantime Joy had been whispering to her mother who
now spoke out:

“Mr. Sheriff, will you allow me to make a suggestion about the places
at table?”

“With a thousand delights, madam. Pray make whatever disposition you
think best. I am only too grateful for your help.”

“Thank you, sir. Well, if you do not mind I should like my sister,
Miss Hayes, placed next to you; then Colonel Ogilvie and myself. On
the other side if you will place next to my son-in-law his old nurse,
I am right sure that both will be pleased.”

“Hear, hear!” said Athlyne. “Come along, Nanny, and sit next your boy!
Joy and I shall be delighted to have you close to us. Won’t you,
darling.” Joy’s answer was quite satisfactory to him:

“Of course … Darling!” It was wonderful what a world of love she put
into the utterance of those two syllables.

The breakfast was a great success, though but few of the party ate
heartily. Neither Athlyne nor Joy did justice to the provender. They
whispered a good deal and held hands surreptitiously under the table,
and their eyes met constantly. The same want of appetite seemed to
have affected both the Sheriff and Judy; but silence and a certain
restraint and primness were their characteristics. Mrs. O’Brien,
seated on the very edge of her chair, was too proud and too happy to
eat. But she was storing up for future enjoyment fond memories of
every incident, however trivial.

It was mid-day before any move was made. There were no speeches--in
public, as all considered it would break the charm that was over the
occasion if anything so overt took place. When all is understood,
speech becomes almost banal. But there were lots of whisperings;
whispers as soft in their tone as their matter was sweet. No one
appeared to notice any one else at such moments; though be sure that
there were words and tones and looks that were remembered later by the
receivers, and looks and movements that were remembered by the others.
Judy and the Sheriff had much to say to each other. Ample opportunity
was given from the fact that the newly married pair found themselves
occupied with each other almost exclusively. Occasionally, of course,
Joy and the Sheriff conversed; but as a working rule he was quite
content to devote himself to Judy who seemed quite able to hold up her
end of the serious flirtation. When finally the party broke up,
preparatory to setting out for the south, the Sheriff asked Colonel
Ogilvie if it might be possible that he should join in travel with the
party, as he wished to spend a few days in Ambleside--a place which he
had not visited for many years. Colonel Ogilvie cordially acquiesced.
He was pretty sure by now that the meeting of Judy and this new friend
would end in a match, and he was glad to do anything which might
result in the happiness of his sister-in-law of whom he was really
fond. But it was not on this account only that he made him welcome.
The reaction from his evil temper was on him. Conscience was awake and
pricking into him the fact that he had behaved brutally. His mind did
not yet agree in the justice of the verdict; but that would doubtless
come later. He now wished to show to all that there was quite another
side of his character. In this view he pressed that the Sheriff should
be his guest. The other was about to object when he realised that by
accepting he would be one of the household, and so much closer to
Judy, and more and oftener in her society than would otherwise be
possible. So he accepted gladly, and he and the Colonel soon became
inseparable--except when Judy was speaking! In such case Colonel
Ogilvie often felt himself rather left out in the cold. At the
beginning of breakfast Athlyne had learned from Joy of the abandonment
of the motor, and he had accordingly sent his father-in-law’s
chauffeur, with his pilot, to bring it back. They had to travel in a
horse carriage; he could not drive two motors at once, and the pilot
could not drive one. In due course the motor was retrieved, and having
been made clean and taut by the “first-class _mechanicien_ and driver”
was ready for the road. Colonel Ogilvie’s motor was also ready, and as
the pilot could now be left to travel home by train so that the owner
could sit by his chauffeur, there would be room for the new guest to
sit between the two ladies in the tonneau. When he mentioned this
arrangement, however, the Sheriff did not jump at it, but found
difficulties in the way of incommoding the ladies. At last he said:

“I hope you will excuse me, Ogilvie, but I had already formed a little
plan which I hoped with your sanction and that of your wife, to carry
out. Before breakfast I--Miss Hayes and I had been talking of the old
manner of posting. Her idea had, I think, been formed by seeing prints
of break-downs of carriages in run-away matches to Gretna Green, and I
suggested … In fact I ventured to offer to drive her in
old-fashioned postal style to Ambleside, and let her see what it was
like. I have in my house at Galloway a fine old shay that my father
and mother made their wedding trip in. It has always been kept in good
trim, and it is all right for the journey. As Sheriff I have post-boys
in my employ for great occasions and I have good horses of my own. So
when J … Miss Hayes accepted my offer … of the journey, I wired
off to have the trap sent down here. Indeed it should arrive within a
very short time. I have also wired for relays of horses to be ready at
Dumfries, Annan, Carlisle and Patterdale, so that when we start we
should go without a hitch. My boys know the road, and four horses will
spin us along in good style--even if we cannot keep up with your
motor.” So it was arranged that the pilot could occupy his old place
with the chauffeur; and the Colonel and Mrs. Ogilvie would travel in
the tonneau, Darby and Joan fashion. This settlement of affairs had
only been arrived at after considerable discussion. When her father
had told Joy that she was to ride with her mother, she had spoken out
at once--without arrangement with Athlyne or even consultation with
him:

“Athlyne will drive me, and we can take Mrs. O’Brien with us. There is
stacks of room in the tonneau, and we have no luggage. I am sure my
husband would like to have her with us.”

But when the arrangement was mentioned to the foster-mother she
refused absolutely to obey any such order:

“What” she said “me go away in the coach wid the bride and groom! An
ould corrn-crake like me wid the quality; an this none other than me
own darlin’ lord and Miss Joy that I’m going to nurse the childher iv
her. No, my Lady, I’ll do no such thing! Do ye think I’m goin’ to
shpoil shport when me darlin’ does be drivin’ wid his beautiful wife
by him an’ him kissin’ her be the yard an’ the mile an’ the hour, an’
huggin’ her be the ton, as he ought to be doin’, or he’s not the man
I’ve always tuk him for. Shure ma’am” this to Mrs. Ogilvie “this is
their day an’ their hour; an’ iviry minit iv it is goold an dimons to
them! I’m tellin’ ye, I’d liefer put me eyes on Styx than do such a
thing!” Mrs. Ogilvie, who recognised the excellence of her ideas,
said:

“Then you must come with the Colonel and me. We’ve loads of room, and
we are all alone.”

“An’ savin’ yer presence, so ye should be ma’am whin ye’re seein’ yer
daughter goin’ aff wid her man. There’s loads iv things you and your
man will want to be talkin’ about. Musha! if it’s only rememberin’
what ye said an’ done whin ye was aff on yer own honeymoon. Mind ye,
ma’am, it’s not bad talkin’ or rememberin’, that’s not! No motors for
me, ma’am--to-day at any rate. I’ll go by the thrain that I kem’ by;
an’ when I get to yer hotel, if I’m before ye, I’ll shtraighten out
things for ye, an’ have the rooms nice an’ ready. For mind ye, ma’am,
me darlin’ Lord tould me that he’s goin’ to have a gran’ weddin’ to
Miss Joy whin he gets his license! Be the way, does he get that, can
ye tell me ma’am, from the polis or where the sheebeeners gits theirs?
An’ av there’s goin’ to be a weddin’ wid flowers an’ gowns an’ veils
an’ things in church, I suppose they won’t be too previous about
comin’ together. Musha! but’s it’s a quare sort iv ways the quality
has! Weddin’s here be the Sheriff, an’ thin be bishops, an’ wid
licenses. An’ him in Bowness--for that’s where he tells me he’s
shtoppin’--an’ his wife in Ambleside--on their weddin’ night! Begob!
Ireland’s changin’ fast, fur that usen’t to be the way. I’m thinkin’
that the Shinn-Fayn’ll have to wake up a bit if that’s the way things
is going to go. Or else there’ll be millea murther, from the Giant’s
Causeway to Cape Clear!” As Mrs. Ogilvie did not wish to discuss this
part of the question herself, she beckoned over Athlyne and told him
that Mrs. O’Brien had refused to go in his motor.

“Not even if I ask you or tell you to?” he said to the old woman,
having not the least intention of doing either.

“Not even thin, me Lord darlin’” she said with a cheery smile. “An’
I’m thinkin’ it’s thankin’ me--you an’ yer lovely wife too--’ll be
before ye’re well out of sight of this place. Faix it’s a nice sort iv
ould gooseberry I’d be, sittin’ in the carriage wid me arrums foulded,
wid me darlin’ Lord sittin’ in front dhrivin’ like a show-flure in a
shute iv leather. An’ his bride beside him, wid her arrums round him
bekase both his own is busy wid the little wheel; an’ her wondhrin’,
wid tears in her beautiful grey eyes, why he doesn’t kiss her what
she’s pinin’ fur. Augh! no! Not me, this time! I was a bride
meself--wanst. An’ I know betther nor me young Lady does now, what is
what on the weddin’ day afther the words is said. Though she’ll pick
up, so she will. She’s not the soort that’ll be long larnin’! Musha
…” Her further revelations and prophesyings were cut short by
Athlyne’s kissing her and saying “Good-bye!”

If the journey up North had been Fairyland, the journey southward was
Heaven for both the young people. Athlyne felt all the triumph of a
conqueror. If he had sung out loud, as he would like to have done, his
song would have been a war-song rather than a love-song. There was the
_elan_ of the conqueror about him; the stress of love-longing and
love-pining were behind him. The battle was won, and his conqueror’s
booty was beside him, well content to be in his train. Still even
conqueror’s love has its duties as well as its right, and he was more
tender than ever to Joy. She, sitting beside him in all the radiancy
of her new found wifehood, felt that their hearts were beating
together; and that their thoughts swayed in unison. When her eyes
would be lifted from the lean, strong, brown hands gripping the
steering wheel--for in the rush of departure he had other things to
think of than putting on the gloves which were squeezed behind him in
his seat--and would look up into his face she would feel a sort of
electric shock as his eyes, leaving for a moment their steering duty,
would flash into hers with a look of love which made her quiver. But
presently when his yielding to affection had been tested, and even her
curiosity had been satisfied, she ceased such sudden looks. She
realized his idea of the gravity of the situation when she saw, as his
eyes returned to their necessary task, the hard look become fixed on
his eagle face--the look which to one engaged in his task means safety
to those under his care. She was all sympathy with him now. She was
content that his will should prevail; that his duty should be the duty
of both; that her service was to help him. And the first moment she
realized this, she sighed happily as she sank back in her seat, her
lover-rapture merged in wife-content. She had compensation for the
foregoing in the exercise of her own pride. From her present
standpoint all that came within the scope of her senses was supremely
beautiful. The mountains grey and mysterious in their higher and
further peaks; the dark woods running flamelike up into the glory of
the mountain colouring; the scent of the new-mown hay, drifted across
the track by the bracing winds sweeping over the hills; the glimmering
sapphire of the water as they swept by lake or river, or caught
flashes of the distant Forth through long green valleys. They went
fast; Athlyne’s wild excitement--the echo of the battle-phrenzy that
had won him distinction on the field--found some relief in speed. He
had thrown open the throttle of his powerful engine and swept along at
such a speed that the whole landscape seemed to fly by the rushing
car, giving only momentary glimpses of even the most far-flung beauty.
He did not fear police traps now. He did not fear anything! Even the
car seemed to have yielded itself like a living thing to the spell of
the situation. Its wheels purred softly as it swept along, and the
speed made a wind which seemed to roar in the ears of the two who were
one.

Joy felt that she had a right to be content. This journey was of her
own choosing entirely. The manner of it had been this: when the party
had been arranged for starting her father had said to Athlyne:

“When you get to Ambleside, as I suppose you will do before us, will
you give orders to have everything ready for our party. You can do
this before you drive over to Bowness. You can come over to dinner if
you like. I suppose you and Joy will want to see something of each
other--all you can indeed, before the wedding comes off. That can be
as soon as you like after you have got the license.” To this he had
replied:

“I should like to--and shall--do anything I can, sir, to meet your
wishes. But I cannot promise to do anything now, on quite my own
initiative. You see our dear girl has to be consulted; and I need not
tell you that her wishes must prevail--so far as I am concerned!”

“Quite right, my boy! Quite right!” said the old man. “Then we shall
leave the orders to her. Here, Joy!” she came over, and her father put
his suggestion to her. She hesitated gravely, and paused before she
spoke; she evidently intended that there should be no mistake as to
her deliberate intention:

“No! Daddy, that won’t do; I’m going with my husband!” She took his
arm and clung to him lovingly, her finger tips biting sweetly into his
flesh. “But, Daddy dear, we’ll come over to-morrow and lunch or
breakfast with you, if we may. Call it early lunch or late breakfast.
We shall be over about noon. Remember we have to come from Bowness!”

Athlyne seemed to float in air as he heard her. There was something so
sweetly--so truly wifely, in her words and attitude that it won to his
heart and set him in a state of rapture.


The late breakfast at Ambleside next day, though ostensibly a mere
family breakfast, was hardly to be classed in that category. It was in
reality regarded by all the family at present resident in that town as
a wedding breakfast. They had one and all dressed themselves for the
occasion. Not in complete marriage costume, which would have looked a
little overdone, but in a modified form which sufficiently expressed
in the mind of each the prevailing spirit of rejoicing. A few seconds
before noon the “toot toot” of Athlyne’s powerful hooter was heard
some distance off. All rushed to the windows to see the great red car
swing round the corner. The chauffeur was driving; the bride and groom
sat in the tonneau. As Athlyne was not driving he wore an ordinary
morning dress--a well-cut suit of light grey which set out well his
tall, lithe powerful figure. Joy was wrapped in a huge motor coat of
soft grey, with her head shrouded in a veil of the same colour. In the
hall they both took off their wraps, Athlyne helping his wife with the
utmost tenderness. When they came into the room they made a grey pair,
for with the exception of Athlyne’s brown eyes and hair and a scarlet
neck tie, and Joy’s dark hair and a flash of the same scarlet as her
husband’s on her breast, they were grey--all grey. It would seem as if
the whole colour-scheme of the couple had been built round Joy’s eyes.
She certainly looked lovely; there was a brilliant colour in her
cheeks, and between her scarlet lips her teeth, when she smiled,
flashed like pearls. She was in a state of buoyancy, seeming rather to
float about than to move like a being on feet. She was all sweetness
and affection, and flitted from one to another, leaving a wake of
beaming happiness behind her.

Athlyne too was manifestly happy; but in quieter fashion, as is the
way of a man. He was not overt or demonstrative in his attention to
Joy; but his eyes followed her perpetually, and his ears seemed to
hear every whisper regarding her. Her eyes too, kept turning to him
wherever she might be or to whom speaking. Judy at first stood beaming
at the pair with a look of proprietary interest; but after a while she
began to be a trifle nettled by the husband’s absorption in her niece.
This feeling culminated when as Joy tripped slightly on the edge of
the hearth-rug her husband started towards her with a swift movement
and with that quick intake of breath which manifests alarmed concern.
Judy’s impulsiveness found its expression in a semi-humorous,
semi-sarcastic remark:

“Why Athlyne you seem to look on the girl as if she was brittle! You
weren’t like that yesterday when you flashed her away from us at sixty
miles an hour!” For a moment there was silence and all eyes were fixed
on Joy who looked embarrassed and turn rosy-red. Athlyne to relieve
her drew their attention on himself:

“No, my dear Judy--I’m not ever going to call you anything else you
know. She wasn’t my wife then!”

“Wasn’t she!” came the answer tartly spoken. “She was just as much
your wife then. She had been married to you only twice! And the first
marriage was good enough for anything. I know that is so, for my
sheriff says so!--Oh …” The ejaculation was due to the shame of
sudden recognition of her confession. She blushed furiously; the
Sheriff, looking radiantly happy, stepped over to her, took her hand,
raised it to his lips, and kissed it.

“I think my dear,” he said slowly and quietly, “that constitutes a
marriage--if you will have it so?” She looked at him shyly and said
quietly:

“If you like to count it a step on the way--like Joy’s first marriage,
do so--dear! Then if you like we can make it real when Joy becomes a
wife--in the Church!”

Everyone in the room was so interested in this little episode that two
of them only noticed a queer note of dissent or expostulation, coming
in the shape of a sort of modified grunt from the two matrons of the
party. Said Athlyne, still mindful of his intent to protect Joy:

“All right, Judy. I’ll remember: ‘_my_ sheriff,’ if there’s any more
chaffing. It seems that he’ll be ‘brittle’ before long!” Judy flashed
one keen happy glance at him as she whispered close in his ear:

“Don’t be ungenerous!” For reply he whispered back:

“Forgive me--dear. I did not intend to be nasty. I’m too happy for
anything of that sort!”

As breakfast wore on and the familiarity of domestic life followed
constraint, matters of the future came on the tapis. When Mrs. Ogilvie
asked the young couple if they had yet settled when the marriage--the
church marriage--was to come off, Joy looked down demurely at the
table cloth as her husband answered:

“I go up to town early in the morning to get the License. It is all in
hand and there will be no hitch and no delay. I had a wire this
morning from my solicitor about it; and also one from the Archbishop
congratulating me. I shall be home by the ten ten train on Thursday
and we can have the wedding late that afternoon, if you will have the
church and the parson ready.”

“But, my dear boy, isn’t that rather sudden?”

“Not sudden enough for me! But really, so far as I am concerned, I
shall wait as long as Joy wishes. Now that we are married already, I
fancy it doesn’t much matter. Only that anything which could possibly
bind me closer to Joy will always be a happiness to me, I don’t care
whether we have a third marriage at all.” Mrs. Ogilvie caught her
daughter’s eye and answered at once:

“So be it then! Thursday afternoon at six. I suppose there can be no
objection as to canonical hours?” The Sheriff answered:

“I can tell you that. The License of the Archbishop goes through and
beyond all canonical hours and all places--in South Britain of course.
Armed with that instrument you can celebrate the marriage when and
where you will.” Joy and Athlyne were by this time holding hands and
whispering.

“Of course Joy will stay with us till then--Athlyne.” Mrs. Ogilvie
spoke the last word with a pause; it was the first time she had used
his name.

“Not ‘of course.’” he answered. “She is the head of her house now and
must be free to do as she please. But I am sure she will like to come
to you.” Joy made a protesting “_moue_” at him as she said:

“Of course I’d like to be with Mother and Daddy, and Judy--if I--if I
am not to be with you--Oh, darling! you’re hurting me. You’re so
frightfully strong!”

Breakfast being over, the party broke up and moved about the room. Joy
was sitting on the sofa with her Mother when Mrs. O’Brien came sidling
up by the wall. When she got close she curtsied and said:

“Won’t ye tell me now, me Lady, if I’m to be the wan to nurse yer
childher?”

“Oh dear! But Mrs. O’Brien, I said only yesterday that I’d tell you
that some other time. You _are_ previous!--Didn’t you hear that I am
to be married on Thursday. Later on …”

“No time like the prisint, me Lady. It was yistherday ye shpoke; an
to-day’s to-day. Mayn’t I nurse yer ch …”

“Tell her, dear--” her Mother had begun, when Judy joined the group.

“What’s all this about? Whose children are you talking of?” began the
merry spinster. But her sister cut her short:

“Never you mind, Judy! You just go and sit down and try and get
accustomed to silence so as to be ready to keep your Sheriff out of an
asylum.” Athlyne, too, with ears preternaturally sharp on Joy’s
account, had heard something of the conversation. Looking over at his
wife, he saw her face divinely rosy, and with a troubled, hunted look
in her eyes. He too instantly waded into the fray.

“I say, let her alone you all! I hope they’re not teasing you
darling?” Joy, fearing that something unpleasant might be said, on one
side or the other, made haste to reassure him.

Then she closed his mouth in the very best way that a young wife can
do--the way that seems to take his feet from earth and to raise him to
heaven.",lady athlyne,Bram Stoker
